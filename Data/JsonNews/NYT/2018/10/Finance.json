{"Headline": "Where in the World Is Denmark\u2019s $2 Billion?", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs large as it is, the building would be easy to miss. Plain, gray and near a McDonald\u2019s, it\u2019s part of a generic office complex surrounded by a vast parking lot in a suburb of Copenhagen. \u201cDanish Tax Agency\u201d is stenciled in both English and Danish on a glass front door.This outpost of SKAT, as the I.R.S. in Denmark is known, seems an improbable setting for what the authorities call one of the great financial crimes in the country\u2019s history. For three years, starting in 2012, so much money gushed from an office here that it was as though the state had sprung a gigantic leak.Prosecutors in Copenhagen say it was an elaborate ruse, one that ultimately cost taxpayers more than $2 billion \u2014 a spectacular sum for Denmark, the equivalent of a $110 billion loss in the far larger American economy.The country had fallen victim to a dubious financial maneuver at the intersection of the tax system and capital markets, a dizzyingly complex transaction known as a \u201ccum-ex\u201d trade.The trade is focused on one of the dullest, most overlooked acts in any financial system \u2014 the request for refunds on taxes withheld on dividends. Under Danish law, the government automatically collects taxes on dividends paid out by companies to their shareholders. If the shareholders live in the United States, they are eligible for a refund on some or all of those taxes.A tiny department in SKAT, run by one man, approved thousands of applications for refunds. Most of the applications were filed by self-directed pension plans in the United States, a type of retirement account for individuals.But experts and lawyers familiar with the scheme say those people were fronts for cum-ex trades. Deploying a kind of financial sleight of hand, the trades made it appear as if the pension plans had purchased shares of Danish companies and paid taxes on the dividends. Neither was true.To the Danes, it was a fraud, one executed and conceived by Sanjay Shah, a 48-year-old, London-born financier. With an assist from employees, he found the Americans, helped facilitate the applications and ended up with much of the money.Mr. Shah denies any wrongdoing and through a publicist says he merely took advantage of a loophole. He now lives in Dubai, where he owns a $1.3 million yacht and a 10,000-square-foot villa with access to the beach. He has become Denmark\u2019s national villain.\u201cYou have this guy, living off fraud, it\u2019s infuriating,\u201d said Joachim B. Olsen, a member of the Danish Parliament and chairman of its Finance Committee. \u201cThe expectation of the Danish people is that we will go after him, no matter the cost.\u201dWhat has made the dividend debacle even more painful is that many here believe it was an inside job. The lone employee approving those tax refunds was a lifelong civil servant named Sven Nielsen. After a lengthy investigation, the police learned that Mr. Nielsen had spent a few boozy and convivial evenings with an employee of Mr. Shah\u2019s, although they found no evidence that he had colluded or profited in any way.Instead, they discovered evidence that years ago, Mr. Nielsen had helped an old friend bilk SKAT in a relatively small scam. Through his lawyer, Mr. Nielsen declined to comment \u2014 from prison, where he is now serving a six-year sentence for criminal fraud in that case.So, Danes are left with a mystery that belongs in a Nordic noir, one with elements of farce and filled with enraging twists. Is Mr. Nielsen a co-conspirator, or a dupe? Is he a criminal or a man so flattered by attention that his critical faculties abandoned him?The other mystery concerns Mr. Shah, who is now rebranding himself as a philanthropist, raising money for autism research by promoting concerts with performers like Flo Rida and Lenny Kravitz. He has been formally termed a suspect by Danish authorities, but to the collective amazement of the Danes no criminal charges have been filed against him.A spokesman for the State Prosecutor for Serious Economic and International Crime would not say why. Instead, with impeccable Scandinavian restraint he said only that the case involves people \u201cwho seem to have used a very crafty setup.\u201dIn each, he sits in a spacious living room in a house in Dubai and muses about his life and business philosophy, omitting any hint of controversy. He comes across as an upbeat, middle-aged expat with an abiding fondness for music. After a midlife crisis, he founded Autism Rocks and became a part-time concert promoter, at one point booking his personal favorite, Prince. Mr. Shah also has a taste for the extravagant. In one video, he said that sports cars parked outside the office at Merrill Lynch, where he worked early on, inspired him to consider a new career.Mr. Shah was raised in London by parents of Indian ancestry who had immigrated from Kenya. He dropped out of college in 1992, citing a lack of motivation, and worked at a number of large financial firms. In 2007, he landed a job at the London office of Rabobank, a Dutch company, on the dividend arbitrage desk.There he learned about cum-ex trades. The term is Latin for \u201cwith-without\u201d and refers to the status of shares before and after a dividend is issued. Cum-ex trades would quickly become the focus of Mr. Shah\u2019s professional life.As economies around the globe reeled, Mr. Shah found himself in one of the few growth segments in banking. Cum-ex trades are made possible by tax treaties between countries, agreements that are intended to prevent double taxation. Denmark has such a treaty with the United States.Traders made off with more than $11 billion, according to officials there. Cum-ex would reap fortunes from the governments in Austria, Belgium and Switzerland, too.It took years for the German authorities, who banned the practice in 2012, to figure out what had hit them. The first cum-ex indictments in the country were filed in May.\u201cIt turned out to be one of the biggest financial scandals that Europe has ever seen,\u201d said Bastian Finkel, a tax lawyer at BLD, a law firm in Cologne, \u201cand all the more painful because it\u2019s public money.\u201dIn the wake of their losses, the authorities in Germany didn\u2019t bother to alert other countries, and speculators moved elsewhere. The biggest target, it turned out, was Denmark.Under the terms of an American-Danish tax agreement, Americans who own shares in, for instance, Carlsberg can get a full or partial refund on the 27 percent withheld for tax on dividends. Retirement accounts get the best deal of all. They get all 27 percent of the tax back.To scale up his cum-ex trade, Mr. Shah needed individuals in the United States with self-directed pension plans, a type of retirement account that allows owners to invest in a wide range of financial instruments. By 2012, he had found more than a dozen of them \u2014 which turned out to be plenty.The names of these Americans who owned the self-directed pension plans became public this summer, when Danish authorities sued them, hoping to recover lost funds. Exactly how these people linked up with Solo Capital is unknown. Mr. Shah\u2019s publicist would say only that they came via wealth management advisory firms.There are demographic patterns. Most live on the East Coast, with clusters in New York, New Jersey and Florida. At least five different plans used the same mailing address, 425 West 23rd Street, Apartment 7B, New York, N.Y. The current tenant there had never heard of the Danish lawsuits, but said he had received mail for one of the defendants, Gavin Crescenzo, a previous occupant.Nearly all the defendants have jobs in finance, though one, Michael Ben-Jacob, is a partner at a prestigious law firm, Arnold & Porter. He declined to discuss the case and a spokeswoman at the firm said it did not comment on litigation in progress.Many people have their names attached to dozens of pension plans, which is why there are 277 suits and roughly 17 defendants. A 30-year-old named Roger Lehman, for instance, opened 44 plans in a handful of states, with names such as the Ludlow Holdings 401K Plan and the Hotel Fromance Pension Plan.Mr. Shah said through his spokesman that Solo Capital worked with 200 of these pension plans. He declined to identify which ones.None of the defendants responded to requests for comment. In July, though, an email response came instead, unbidden, from a law firm in Luxembourg called Schaffelhuber M\u00fcller & Kollegen. A partner there named Helene Schwiering stated that her clients, whom she did not name, would appreciate it \u201cif you henceforth refrain from attempting to contact them.\u201dOn paper, the owners of the plans pocketed most of SKAT\u2019s $2 billion. In reality, these people probably wound up with little or none of the money.That, at least, is the impression of John Hanamirian, a plaintiffs attorney in New Jersey. Until mid-July, he represented defendants in more than 50 cases, then he suddenly filed legal papers withdrawing from all but a few of them.The withdrawal filings were revealing. They stated that Mr. Hanamirian was not paid by defendants named in the lawsuits. Rather, his bills were paid by what he described only as a \u201cLuxembourg law firm.\u201d And that law firm would not provide needed files about his defendants, \u201cdespite repeated requests,\u201d he wrote.In an interview, Mr. Hanamirian elaborated. The firm was the one in Luxembourg that sent that out-of-the-blue email asking that defendants in the cases be left alone.\u201cI needed documents surrounding their involvement, whatever that is \u2014 bank statements, investment statements, communications,\u201d Mr. Hanamirian said. \u201cThe firm wouldn\u2019t do it. They said, \u2018We\u2019ll meet you in advance, the day of the proceedings.\u2019 I said that\u2019s unacceptable.\u201dBefore exiting the cases, Mr. Hanamirian spoke to a handful of clients who told him that money went in and then was immediately moved out of their accounts. Whether the defendants earned a fee of some kind is unknown to Mr. Hanamirian, as is the ultimate destination of the funds.\u201cI don\u2019t want any of this to reflect on my former clients,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the whole thing was definitely odd.\u201dIn 2013, all that stood between Solo Capital and Denmark\u2019s treasury was the bespectacled, gray-haired veteran of SKAT, Sven Nielsen. After two colleagues retired, he was the last person in the Dividend Department. Complicating matters, he lacked the tools to perform the most basic due diligence when reviewing refund applications.The agency was in the midst of a yearslong and often disastrous overhaul, meant to digitize the system and reduce head count. The priority was helping Danish taxpayers, not foreign shareholders. Mr. Nielsen didn\u2019t even have a database to check whether an individual pension plan actually owned the shares it claimed, said Lisbeth Romer, who was Mr. Nielsen\u2019s boss until she retired in 2013.\u201cSven\u2019s job was reduced to bookkeeping, essentially, checking if a form was filled out properly,\u201d she said. \u201cA monkey could do it.\u201dThere was another problem that nobody knew about then: Mr. Nielsen could be persuaded to break the law. When the Danish police searched his home after the Solo Capital revelations, they found a letter showing that in 2007, he helped an old friend illegally secure $5.7 million from SKAT. (The two men knew each other from the days when Mr. Nielsen moonlighted with a job delivering newspapers.) Last December, prosecutors convicted Mr. Nielsen of fraud for taking a kickback, the equivalent of $315,000, for his efforts.Defenders of Mr. Nielsen maintain that he is a fundamentally decent guy who made a serious mistake under the suasion of a pal. True or not, Mr. Nielsen had a new pal in 2014, just as the SKAT payouts soared.His name was Camilo Vargas. He worked in London at one of a small number of \u201cpayment agents,\u201d niche companies that handle the array of paperwork submitted to foreign tax authorities for refunds. Mr. Vargas had just founded his own payment agent firm, which he called Syntax GIS. Soon after Syntax began operations, it started working with Sanjay Shah, who eventually bought the company.During the first of several trips to Copenhagen, Mr. Vargas sought out Mr. Nielsen, asking for guidance on how to fill out Danish tax refund applications. What is known about those meetings comes from the one interview Mr. Nielsen has ever given, in a 2016 documentary that ran on DR, Denmark\u2019s version of the BBC. Mr. Nielsen appeared to be flattered by the attention and happy to provide advice.He just as gladly accepted invitations to dinner. Mr. Nielsen described in the interview a lively evening drinking beer with Mr. Vargas in a popular downtown area in Copenhagen.\u201cWe walked down Stroget,\u201d he said, referring to a famous pedestrian street, \u201cand made several pit stops.\u201dThe friendship was fantastically lucrative. In 2014, more than $590 million was paid on 1,500 refund applications. Danish authorities believe most of them came from Solo Capital clients. In the first seven months of 2015, the figures soared to roughly $1.2 billion, paid to more than 2,500 applications \u2014 about 16 applications every working day.It apparently never occurred to Mr. Nielsen that Camilo Vargas was playing him.\u201cAt no point did I get the impression that he wanted to trick me or cheat in any way,\u201d Mr. Nielsen said in the documentary, sounding bereft. \u201cBut that\u2019s what it could appear like today.\u201dMr. Vargas could not be located for comment. The producers at DR hired a researcher to find him, to no avail.In the summer of 2015, the pace of applications made one final surge. In July alone, $500 million in refunds was disbursed \u2014 about $25 million per working day, $3 million every hour.Mr. Shah may have had a hunch that the Danish tax refund machine was about to stop working. In May 2015, he met in London with his then-new compliance officer at Solo Capital, Navin Khokhrai. As Mr. Shah put it in the handwritten letter provided by his publicist, Mr. Khokhrai expressed profound reservations about Solo Capital\u2019s business, telling his boss that he was unsure \u201cwhether the company was processing the trades correctly.\u201d Mr. Shah assured him that he\u2019d obtained all necessary legal clearances.Mr. Khokhrai was apparently not convinced. He resigned soon after and Mr. Shah stated in the same handwritten letter that his former employee \u201csubmitted a whistle-blower letter to HMRC\u201d \u2014 Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs \u2014 \u201calleging that Solo had created fictitious client accounts and trading records in order to defraud the tax authorities in Denmark and Belgium.\u201dIn August 2015, the dividends stopped flowing out of SKAT, though not because of sirens set off by anyone inside the agency. Rather, it took a tip from the British government to end the scheme, several Danish politicians said. The London offices of Solo Capital were later raided by Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency and by July 2016 Solo Capital closed.At the time, Mr. Shah said he had done nothing improper. \u201cHad they accused a large bank like Goldman Sachs the bank would have kicked back with a large team of lawyers,\u201d he told Borsen, a Danish newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to target a single individual.\u201dDanish authorities have been trying to unravel Mr. Shah\u2019s handiwork for over three years. Much of his modus operandi was revealed, experts believe, in 2017 when police in Germany, who were acting at the behest of the Danes, used a search warrant to sift through the records of North Channel Bank, a small bank in Mainz, a city outside Frankfurt. A team of 60 investigators found that the bank was used by 27 of the American pension plans, which were ultimately paid a total of about $168 million by SKAT.What investigators found is that the accounts didn\u2019t actually own any shares of Danish companies, said Prof. Christoph Spengel, who served as an adviser to Germany\u2019s Parliament during an inquiry into the questionable trades. He studied the results of the North Channel investigation, issued in a report by a German district attorney. He said that the 27 plans primarily traded with one another. One would place an order to short a chunk of shares of Danish stock \u2014 essentially, a promise to buy the shares once they dipped below a certain price.Soon after, an order was placed by another of the 27 plans to buy the order for the shorted shares. That open buy order \u2014 essentially, a promise to purchase shares that the other plan still didn\u2019t own \u2014 was proof enough for SKAT to approve a refund. Once the refund was issued, the buy order was canceled.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a transaction, this wasn\u2019t tax planning,\u201d Professor Spengel said. \u201cThis was fraud.\u201dA spokeswoman for North Channel said the bank was cooperating with the authorities and had no comment.After funds were wired to North Bank, Professor Spengel said, they were shunted to two banks, first in London, then another in Germany. Finally, he said, they were sent to accounts controlled by Mr. Shah and his wife, Usha.Jack Irvine, Mr. Shah\u2019s spokesman, said none of this was true.\u201cNeither Solo nor Sanjay have had anything to do with North Channel Bank,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cso there appears to be confusion, which is not unusual in this case.\u201dThere has been outrage in Denmark over the SKAT scandal but so far the repercussions have been surprisingly limited. No ministers have been fired. The director of SKAT was laid off in August 2016, though Mr. Shah\u2019s machinations were among several causes. A new investigation into the cum-ex disaster was ordered by the justice minister in February, which could last years. For now, politicians here seem to emphasize pragmatism over finger-pointing.\u201cIn the past, governments have fallen because of investigations like this,\u201d said Jesper Petersen, a member of the opposition Social Democratic Party. \u201cBut we have yet to find any minister who saw evidence of this problem and ignored it.\u201dSanjay Shah is preoccupied with his own troubles. In mid-September, a High Court of Justice judge in London entered a $1.3 billion default judgment against Solo Capital and a company it owned, Elysium Global, in a case filed by SKAT alleging fraud. Mr. Shah\u2019s spokesman said his client didn\u2019t respond to the lawsuit because both companies are now controlled by liquidators.He also said that at the prodding of Danish officials, Britain, Germany and the United Arab Emirates have all frozen, though not confiscated, $660 million in assets belonging to Mr. Shah. The financial pinch is enough that Mr. Shah has been forced to put his house up for sale, the publicist added. Out of caution, the publicist said, Mr. Shah does not travel.Fears of arrest and extradition are justified, said Henning Sorensen, an associate law professor at the University of Southern Denmark.\u201cShah is free as long as he stays in Dubai,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is like a bird living in a golden cage.\u201dAn earlier version of the article included a picture that misidentified the person shown. It was Thomas G. Svaneborg, not Sven Nielsen, a Danish civil servant who was being interviewed by Mr. Svaneborg in a documentary that was the source of the picture.An earlier version of this article misstated the place where Lenny Kravitz performed a concert.

{"Headline": "Democrats Surge Ahead of Republicans in Fund-Raising for Key Races", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Democratic candidates are outpacing the fund-raising of their Republican rivals in key congressional races, but huge checks from conservatives assured that their side will remain financially competitive in the weeks before next month\u2019s midterms.In an election season that appears likely to shatter midterm fund-raising records, Democrats outraised their Republican opponents in 32 of the closest 45 House races by a total margin of $154 million to $108 million since November 2016, according to an analysis of reports filed Monday with the Federal Election Commission. Even in the 13 targeted races in which Republicans outraised their Democratic rivals, the margin was a less gaping $41 million to $31 million.\u201cYou don\u2019t buy your way into office, but this kind of money makes victory possible in scenarios where it otherwise might not have been,\u201d said Bob Biersack, a campaign finance expert who previously worked at the election commission. He predicted that the period covered in the reports filed Monday \u2014 from the beginning of July to the end of September \u2014 \u201cis probably going to be the largest quarter in the history of midterms,\u201d fueled, he said, by small-dollar donations to Democrats.With the midterm elections approaching, we tracked the war chests of candidates in the tightest House races.Democratic campaigns are using their resources to fund get-out-the-vote efforts and aggressive advertising campaigns linking their Republican rivals to Mr. Trump and his more divisive pronouncements and positions, including his nomination and fierce defense of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.Mr. Malinowski, a former assistant secretary of state under President Barack Obama, has outraised Mr. Lance, who has held the seat since 2009 and is considered a moderate, $5.5 million to $2.1 million, according to filings submitted Monday.In one of the most closely fought Senate races, the Democratic incumbent in Missouri, Senator Claire McCaskill, has raised $30.1 million, compared with the $8.5 million raised by her Republican opponent, the state\u2019s attorney general, Josh Hawley.But Republicans have had their bright spots in campaign fund-raising. In a tight House race in northwestern Pennsylvania, the Republican incumbent, Mike Kelly, has more than doubled the fund-raising of his Democratic challenger, Ron DiNicola, $2.3 million to $1.1 million.And Republicans in two of the most contested Senate races have poured in huge sums of their own money to create advantages; Gov. Rick Scott of Florida has provided 71 percent of the $55 million his campaign has taken in, while New Jersey\u2019s Bob Hugin lent his campaign almost all of the $26 million it has raised.Republicans also are leaning heavily on wealthy partisans to close the campaign fund-raising gap in other races with huge donations to independent groups, including nonprofits and so-called super PACs. Such organizations can accept contributions without any limits, while donations to federal campaigns are capped at $5,400 per election cycle.Republican super PACs like the Congressional Leadership Fund are using the cash to try to offset the Democratic advantages in campaign fund-raising by spending money on voter mobilization and other tasks traditionally handled by campaigns, instead of the television ads on which such groups traditionally spent the majority of their cash.\u201cThat\u2019s an experiment in process, and the jury is still out on whether that can be successful,\u201d said Michael Toner, a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission who represents Republican campaigns, including the 2016 presidential bid of the former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. \u201cFor outside money to be of equal value to campaign money, they\u2019ve got to be effective at turning people out, because people aren\u2019t watching TV anymore.\u201dPresident Trump\u2019s campaign committees raised $18 million between the beginning of July and the end of last month, bringing their total raised since his election to $106 million. That is an extraordinary sum for a president\u2019s first two years and will give him a major head start over any prospective Democratic rival.Haeyoun Park and Annie Daniel contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fixing the Climate Requires More Than Technology", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMajor transformations can happen in a generation. But not without government help.Drs. Oreskes and Conway are historians of science and the authors of \u201cThe Collapse of Western Civilization \u2014 A View from the Future.\u201d Last week\u2019s report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was bad news from top to bottom. Dangerous planetary warming is underway, it\u2019s happening faster than scientists predicted, and time is running out to stop it.What does this mean for us? Right now, government is widely seen as inefficient and ineffective, and our needs are thought to be best addressed by the private sector, through entrepreneurship, venture capital and Silicon Valley-style \u201cdisruption.\u201d But unless we acknowledge the need for a substantial government role, we are going to be stuck, because change driven solely by the marketplace is unlikely to suffice.Some might object that our current challenge is vastly different from those met by past technological changes, because we\u2019re not just talking about a thing, like a radio or cellphone, but about changing our entire energy system. But these earlier transformations involved systems, too. Just as energy technology isn\u2019t one thing, neither were the railroads, radio, electricity or the internet. Those systems all involved many parts, including federal, state and local policies to support them (the land grants that made the railroads possible, for instance, or role of the Federal Trade Commission in licensing radio and television stations).What makes large-scale technological change challenging is the integration of all of those parts. Electricity wasn\u2019t just a matter of turbines, or even turbines, power lines and transformers. Financing and regulation were also required. After electricity was introduced to the urban marketplace, the biggest obstacle to its expanded use was profitability. The private sector was able to make money bringing electricity to densely populated cities like New York, St. Louis and Chicago, but it took federal intervention, under the 1936 Rural Electrification Act, to bring it to rural communities across America. And even then, uptake was not immediate. Rural electrification boosters insisted that hard-working farmers urgently needed electricity, but initial demand was less than expected. The Tennessee Valley Authority wanted to cut rates to drive up demand. But private utilities opposed this, worrying that low rates would threaten their financing, and the T.V.A. settled on an appliance subsidy to drive increased household consumption. Demand had to be built.The internet was created by scientists funded by the federal government\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency. Al Gore didn\u2019t build it, but he did sponsor the 1991 legislation that made it public, which laid the foundation for the World Wide Web, Silicon Valley, smartphones and our information-driven society.Demand for new technologies is rarely entirely spontaneous. If people have been living without something, it\u2019s not always obvious to them why they now need it. They are likely to resist being told that they must spend money or endure inconvenience to change. In most cases, demand has to be developed and nurtured. A case for change has to be made, supported by public policy. The fact that many of these technological revolutions took hold in a generation\u2019s time is partly because young people were quicker to adopt these new technologies than their elders. Some think that if we focus on technology, we can somehow avoid the messiness of politics and partisanship. But we won\u2019t get the energy technologies we need and the systems to make them work in the time we need them if we don\u2019t have the government policies to make them a reality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Prize for Big Oil Firms, Caspian Deal Eases Access", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAn international consortium financing the field, called Kashagan, has invested more than $50 billion to overcome challenges typical of the Caspian Sea region, such as deep oil that is under tremendous pressure.As the Western majors moved into the new Caspian oil frontier in the 1990s, every step seemed harder than anticipated, even as the region was seen as vital for diversifying global oil supplies away from the Middle East.Until the Soviet collapse nearly 30 years ago, the Caspian, the world\u2019s largest inland body of water, was regarded by Iran and the Soviet Union as a lake, with a border neatly dividing their maritime territories.The agreement signed by Russia, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan and Iran \u2014 a club seen in the West as mostly a rogues\u2019 gallery of dictatorships and pariahs, but at least now getting along among themselves \u2014 took both approaches in the eventual compromise.The agreement treats the surface of the Caspian as international water and divides the seabed into territorial zones. Importantly from the point of view of Eurasian energy politics, it allows undersea pipelines.\u201cIt is correct to view the recent summit and convention as an unprecedented milestone for the region that has been decades in the making,\u201d Ashley Sherman, principal research analyst for the Caspian and Europe at Wood Mackenzie, a company advising the oil industry, said in a telephone interview.Russia had for most of the post-Soviet period objected to east-west energy trade through new subsea pipelines, hoping to keep in place the north-south trade routes of the Soviet Union\u2019s existing rail and pipeline system.Russia pushed back initially with a commercial strategy to undermine the financial rationale for a southern gas pipeline. Gazprom, the Russian gas monopoly, bought up potential supplies of natural gas in the Caspian region.\u201cRussia remains very, very keenly focused on market share in its critical export market today in Europe,\u201d Jonathan Elkind, a fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University and a former United States assistant secretary of energy, said in a telephone interview. \u201cI do not think the signing of the agreement last month represents any kind of cardinal shift in Russia\u2019s views on that matter.\u201dEurasian pipeline politics, not unlike the web of pipes themselves, is an interconnected game. Russia also offered the Caspian agreement as a concession, said Ilya Ponomarev, a former member of the Russian Parliament, to ease acceptance of something the Russians value more: the Nord Stream 2 pipeline to Germany.But Russia has not wholly surrendered its ability to veto future pipeline development. The agreement allows trans-Caspian pipelines. But an agreement signed simultaneously, the Protocol on Cross-border Environmental Impacts, requires that states \u201cconsult\u201d on ecological risks.Rebecca Arnold, a spokeswoman for Exxon, declined to comment on the treaty\u2019s significance for the oil business as the rules for dividing up the sea are \u201cmatters for governments to address.\u201dCompanies have already invested about $40 billion into the southern corridor for natural gas, to ship fuel from the BP-operated Shah Deniz field in Azerbaijan\u2019s territorial water to Italy. \u201cWe\u2019re not starting from scratch here,\u201d Mr. Sherman said.The treaty allows Western energy companies, in theory, to push the southern gas corridor farther east, across the sea to tap Turkmenistan\u2019s vast gas reserves and alleviate dependence on Russian gas.Analysts see most of the benefit for oil companies in areas that might be freed from Iranian claims under the treaty, and where the United States Geological Survey estimates most of the undiscovered oil and natural gas lies. The agreement does not settle bilateral territorial disputes among Iran, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan in the sea\u2019s south, but lays out a formula for doing so. Iranian nationalists have already been objecting to the treaty, threatening to renege.\u201cFor global supply,\u201d said Mr. Elkind of Columbia University, \u201cit has been a good thing.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But in Riyadh, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin held a wide-ranging meeting with Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, who is suspected of playing a role in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident.Mr. Mnuchin, who canceled his attendance at this week\u2019s Saudi investment conference in the wake of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, traded views with Prince Mohammed on economic ties and counterterrorism initiatives, as well as on the investigation into Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, according to a Treasury Department spokesman.\u201cI am not satisfied with what I have heard,\u201d President Trump said to reporters before flying to a rally in Texas.But Mr. Trump reiterated the value of the $110 billion arms deal he announced with Saudi Arabia, as well as other American business ties with the kingdom. \u201cI do not want to lose the investment being made in our country,\u201d he said.The meeting between Mr. Mnuchin and Prince Mohammed was unplanned and came at the request of the Saudis, according to a person familiar with the situation. But it added to the portrait of a White House eager to move on from the killing of Mr. Khashoggi to a more routine relationship with its key Arab ally.Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, who has been the key contact with Prince Mohammed, likened the doubts about the truthfulness of Saudi officials to the run-of-the-mill perfidy that the White House deals with in Washington.\u201cEvery day we deal with people who are trying to deceive us in different ways,\u201d Mr. Kushner said during a CNN forum in Manhattan. \u201cBut our job is to see through it, but also to stay focused on what\u2019s best for the American people.\u201dThe administration has shifted its tone repeatedly on the Saudi response to the killing. But Mr. Trump has stopped short of pointing a finger at Prince Mohammed and has steadfastly defended the 33-year-old heir to the Saudi throne, whom the White House has cultivated and views as a critical partner in its efforts to isolate Iran.Mr. Mnuchin was the first senior American official to meet face to face with Prince Mohammed since the Saudi government confirmed on Friday that Mr. Khashoggi was killed. It had earlier insisted that he left the consulate and disappeared afterward.The Saudi Foreign Ministry lost no time in publicizing the session, posting a photograph on Twitter of Mr. Mnuchin sitting across from Prince Mohammed in an opulent reception room, listening while his host made a point.Prince Mohammed stressed \u201cthe importance of Saudi-US strategic partnership, where it holds an important role in the future in line with the Kingdom\u2019s #Vision2030,\u201d the tweet said, referring to the prince\u2019s ambitious program to modernize his kingdom.A Treasury Department spokesman said the meeting was focused on combating terrorist financing and corralling Iran\u2019s influences in the region and that the two men discussed the Khashoggi investigation.In an interview on Sunday in Jerusalem, Mr. Mnuchin said that Saudi Arabia needed to do more to demonstrate that Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing was unintentional. But he defended his decision to travel to Riyadh and meet with Saudi officials, saying his trip was aimed at reinforcing ties at a critical moment, as the United States tries to ratchet up pressure on Iran.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee who over the weekend said he believed Prince Mohammed was culpable in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing, criticized Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s decision to meet with the royal.\u201cIf their talks were about financial matters, I certainly think they should not have gone forward,\u201d Mr. Schiff said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf they were about counterterrorism issues, it\u2019s hard to believe how fruitful those could be.\u201dThe meeting occurred hours after Mr. Kushner said the White House was still engaged in \u201cfact-finding\u201d into Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death but that it had its \u201ceyes wide open\u201d as the investigations into his killing continued.The grounds for skepticism only seemed to deepen on Monday. The revelation that the Saudis deployed a body double added to the multiplying doubts about the Saudi explanation of how Mr. Khashoggi, 59, died.It suggested there was a premeditated plan to make Mr. Khashoggi disappear, through death or abduction, and to cover it up \u2014 possibly contradicting the Saudi insistence that his killing was the accidental result of an altercation.Mr. Trump, in an interview with USA Today, called it \u201ca plot gone awry.\u201dMr. Kushner, a key adviser on the Mideast peace process, has developed a strong relationship with the Saudi crown prince.He has talked to Prince Mohammed several times in the last week, and has come under criticism amid reports that he has advised Mr. Trump to wait before jumping to conclusions about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death.\u201cI think that, again, the president is focused on what\u2019s good for America, what are strategic interests,\u201d Mr. Kushner said. \u201cWhere do we share interests with other countries \u2014 let\u2019s work toward those.\u201dHe made the remarks in his first televised interview since the 2016 election, conducted by the political activist Van Jones, at the \u201cCitizen by CNN\u201d forum in Manhattan.Mr. Kushner said that the president was mindful of getting answers, but he noted that the Saudis have been a strategic ally of the United States.When Mr. Jones noted that even Mr. Trump had said that there had been \u201cdeception\u201d and \u201clies\u201d from the Saudis in relation to the Khashoggi case, Mr. Kushner offered a more muted response.\u201cWe\u2019re getting facts in from multiple places,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce those facts come in, the secretary of state will work with our national security team to help us determine what we want to believe.\u201dWhen Mr. Kushner was asked what advice he personally had given the crown prince, he replied, \u201cTo be transparent.\u201d He added, \u201cThe world is watching.\u201dDismissing criticism of his ties to the crown prince, Mr. Kushner said he did not pay attention to his critics. At another point, he said he heeded criticism only if it was from someone he respected.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia. He is Mohammed bin Salman, not Salam.Alan Rappeport contributed reporting from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and Eric Schmitt from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Barry Jenkins\u2019s Films of Love, Pain and Black Male Vulnerability", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "The \u201cMoonlight\u201d director brings his intuitive approach to an adaptation of James Baldwin\u2019s \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk.\u201d\u201cI want the music to hit exactly where it hit before, you know?\u201d He waited for a response. \u201cYou know what I mean, Joi?\u201dJoi McMillon laughed, and kept her back to Jenkins as she clicked through the file. She is the first African-American woman to have been nominated for the Academy Award for film editing, for her work on Jenkins\u2019s \u201cMoonlight.\u201d They have known each other since their college days, in the film program at Florida State University. \u201cYessir,\u201d she said. \u201cIt definitely will hit where it was before.\u201dThe room was too warm, and just as I thought this, the ceiling vent belched out even warmer air. Male voices down the hall discussed character motivation in some other project. McMillon made the change to the music and played the pass for Jenkins again. The penultimate scene of his film.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like ... ,\u201d Jenkins began. \u201cNot like jazz, because it\u2019s clich\u00e9d to say. But yeah, sometimes one movement needs to de-escalate before the next movement can escalate. This is the place where I feel it. It just sucks, because making this choice at this moment means that when we screen in Toronto we won\u2019t have this adjustment in it.\u201d It was the first Wednesday in September, and the Toronto International Film Festival was only four days away. The film, \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk,\u201d would have its premiere there without these 16 seconds, though it\u2019s hard to say if anyone not named Barry Jenkins would have noticed.This was my second meeting with Jenkins, and \u2014 more than during the first \u2014 his demeanor seemed bifurcated, one foot still in the shaping of the work, the other stepping into the role of a presenter, devising talking points that would carry him from Toronto through the film\u2019s limited release on Nov. 30, perhaps into the awards season beyond. \u201cI learned the hard way on \u2018Moonlight\u2019 that it\u2019s best to be at the forefront of the conversation,\u201d he told me that morning. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like tennis, you know? You want to be leading, and not playing off the back foot.\u201d Still, he was eager to show me outtakes, moments that might have been. He spoke of the film as if it possessed an immune system, one with a long list of irritants it couldn\u2019t abide. \u201cThe film rejected it,\u201d he said wistfully of one deleted scene.A work of cinema, like a novel, is a collage. The finished product is a result of hundreds of moments of cut and paste: this take moved and placed next to another one, this voice recorded to change the feel of a scene shot with no voice-over in mind. A shift to the arrangement or size of one small piece can make the whole collage feel unstable, particularly to the collagist. Each time McMillon played the pass again, the score, composed by Nicholas Britell, swelled up and embraced us before shrinking away on command. The scene \u2014 on its own, compellingly composed \u2014 slid closer to rapturous with the addition of music. A novelist would kill for such a tool.\u201cWhat do you notice about that sequence?\u201d Jenkins asked me. I\u2019d watched it several times at this point, but I wasn\u2019t sure what in particular I was supposed to notice. \u201cO.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll call it. That\u2019s me imitating Baldwin. The voice-over, that\u2019s the one bit of voice-over not taken from the book.\u201dJenkins\u2019s apartment, with its wall-length windows, film-related art and preponderance of books, seems an apt place to house this small part of Baldwin\u2019s literary footprint. In his living room I spotted Marilynne Robinson\u2019s \u201cGilead\u201d (\u201cI\u2019ve read it at least six times\u201d), Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s \u201cPale Fire\u201d and, of course, plenty of books by Baldwin himself. On the cement floor \u2014 under a bookshelf, behind a vintage cream couch \u2014 I spotted Jenkins\u2019s Oscar for best adapted screenplay. Jenkins saw me looking and said he was working on a better spot for it. But he did have the envelope revealing the best-picture win for \u201cMoonlight\u201d framed and hung on the wall, alongside a congratulatory note from Warren Beatty \u2014 one of the presenters who mistakenly announced that \u201cLa La Land\u201d had won \u2014 telling him the honor was \u201cmuch deserved.\u201d After the ensuing hubbub subsided, Jenkins went to M\u00e9rida, Mexico, for a few days to clear his mind. \u201cMy favorite thing to do is to sit in the window, the front window of a cafe looking out at the sidewalk,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is the worst thing to do, or at least in the immediate aftermath of what happened.\u201dIn addition to this new film\u2019s being the much-anticipated follow-up to \u201cMoonlight,\u201d it is also the first big-screen English-language film adaptation of a novel by Baldwin, a writer whose works are closely guarded by his estate. Much of the country, owing to our current political reality and Raoul Peck\u2019s 2016 documentary, \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d has recently become better acquainted with a truth black readers grasped long ago: James Baldwin was right about everything. Jenkins began his adaptation of Baldwin\u2019s fifth novel back in 2013, writing a faithful screen version of the 1974 book, in which a pregnant 19-year-old woman named Tish works, alongside her family, to prove the innocence of her child\u2019s jailed father, a young sculptor. This being Baldwin, of course, there\u2019s more to it: a meditation on the radical implications of declaring yourself an artist while black, on what it means to be poor in New York, on the power and limitations of romantic and filial love.According to Jenkins, this would be the first of his feature films to directly grapple with political themes, but I begged to differ, bringing up the role that gentrification played in his first feature, the 2008 morning-after romance \u201cMedicine for Melancholy\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s set in San Francisco, and the two leads even stumble onto a round-table discussion of rising housing prices. In \u201cMoonlight\u201d the ravages of the war on drugs and the brutality of poverty are not at all apolitical. True, Jenkins said, but with that film, \u201cthe whole movie is created to almost force the audience to confront what this character is feeling. And so it\u2019s really easy to sit outside the film and just want to hug the film, to hug the main character. But this is Baldwin. In Baldwin, everyone\u2019s implicated, including himself. So I think there\u2019s not a passive path through this film.\u201d It didn\u2019t appear to bother Jenkins that this might make it harder for some \u201cMoonlight\u201d devotees to stay along for the ride to \u201cBeale Street.\u201d There were still plenty of reasons to want to hug this film too.Barry Jenkins is 38, under six feet tall and solidly built, with a curated nerdiness: translucent glasses, brightly printed oxford shirts, slip-on sneakers, a canvas tote bag. He is willfully kind, and has a plethora of ways to put others at ease. He might call you \u201cbruh\u201d or \u201cboss\u201d or \u201cmy dear\u201d or \u201cboss lady,\u201d though when adamant he\u2019s apt to call anyone, regardless of gender, \u201cman.\u201d When he listens to you speak, he lets you know he\u2019s there via a steady cadence of mm-hmms, about 10 per minute, sometimes more. He has the sort of smile that if glimpsed across the room at a cocktail party might compel you to walk over and stand near him. \u201cI will not annoy, rebuff or humiliate you,\u201d this smile says.\u201cOne of the things he says to me a lot is, you know, \u2018flies with honey,\u2019\u2009\u201d his producer, Adele Romanski, another former film-school classmate, told me. \u201cI think that\u2019s a life philosophy that he extends to the work.\u201d This is a useful stance if you are interested in getting actors to open up, to bare themselves. The stereotype of the American director-auteur may be of the demanding genius who bullies his actors into transcendent performances, but Jenkins prefers a nurturing approach: \u201cI try to find a language that the actor can participate in,\u201d he says. \u201cThere has to be a language for every single person on set.\u201d These efforts translate onto the screen. But what exactly is it that\u2019s being translated?It begins with vulnerability. I\u2019ve spent my life loving black men, and I understand black masculinity to be malleable, its fabled rigidity overblown. After work, in the dark, I\u2019ve heard whispered secrets, the wanderings of restless minds. And yet all of my moviegoing life I\u2019d never seen this quotidian vulnerability so accurately rendered in film \u2014 not without a wink, a glance away, some posturing that distances \u2014 until I saw Jenkins\u2019s \u201cMoonlight.\u201d An adult son tries to keep emotional distance from his mother, a recovering crack-cocaine addict, and cannot; tears stream down his face instead. A drug dealer confirms his profession to a boy (the same son, but younger), thereby admitting to playing a part in what holds the mother captive; the boy leaves, and the drug dealer (a father figure, not a monster) stares straight ahead, defeated. In \u201cBeale Street,\u201d we watch the main character, Fonny, listen to his friend Daniel describe the psychological horror of prison. Daniel begins the conversation nonchalant, swigging a beer, and ends it with his shoulders stooped forward, the light drained from his eyes. His honesty and helpless frustration is so familiar from my actual life that it is nearly too much to bear \u2014 a perfect moment of cinema.I asked Jenkins about his ability to capture a rarely depicted kind of black male vulnerability as he drove us down Vermont Avenue in his white Toyota Prius. He said nothing for a while, a first in our hours of conversation. A chopped-and-screwed version of Solange\u2019s \u201cA Seat at the Table\u201d drifted from the speakers. \u201cI will say that\u2019s not a goal, but I would hope that\u2019s true,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI think I know what you\u2019re talking about, especially these last two films.\u201dJenkins is open, specific and effusive when talking about craft, narrative, culture, sports or politics. Less so when discussing himself. He tends to speak in long bursts, turning an idea around out loud before hitting on the declarative statement he likes. He started talking about his work adapting \u201cIn Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,\u201d the autobiographical script by Tarell Alvin McCraney that became his breakthrough feature. The story had uncanny overlaps with Jenkins\u2019s own biography: an addicted mother, an upbringing in the same Miami ghetto, subjects Jenkins would not have been comfortable exploring without McCraney\u2019s words as an intermediary. \u201cI can take Tarell\u2019s experience,\u201d Jenkins said, \u201cwhich is much more open than mine, and I can sew cinematic storytelling into it.\u201d McCraney, whose gay coming-of-age story informs the plot of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d describes Jenkins, who has a girlfriend, as approaching emotionality with something akin to a queer imagination: \u201cI think he has moments where his imagination is not normative. Just look at his work and see. Where there should be broad strokes there are polka dots.\u201d\u201cBarry loves love,\u201d Romanski says. \u201cIf you look at his work, there are three different types of love stories from \u2018Medicine\u2019 to \u2018Moonlight\u2019 to \u2018Beale,\u2019 but they\u2019re all love stories.\u201d Love, yes, but also pain. Nat Sanders, who edited both \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cBeale Street\u201d with McMillon, says there\u2019s \u201ca duality\u201d to Jenkins: \u201cAny time he wants to, he\u2019s so charismatic and exuberant. When I do a pass of a scene that really excites him, you get the best reaction you could ever hope to get. He\u2019ll do airplanes around the room and jump up and down, yell \u2018Bruh! Bruh!\u2019 and it\u2019s the best. But also, he\u2019s very private and very quiet.\u201d In \u201cChlorophyl,\u201d a short film Jenkins directed in 2011, working without a formal script, the main character, played by Ana Laura Trevi\u00f1o, reads a James Baldwin quote, translating into Spanish: \u201cLove does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up.\u201d In a moment of improvisation, Jenkins had handed her his leather cellphone case, on which he\u2019d paid to have these words embossed.Although he values romance in film, Jenkins is hesitant to say he places as much importance on romantic love in his own life. \u201cI\u2019ve allowed myself to experience growth in love once in my life, but it was so long ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve become accustomed to being alone, or if because of the way I grew up I became conditioned to being alone. But I guess my identity has been formed around being alone.\u201dWe were back downtown now, in the Arts District, pulling up to a bookstore on the hunt for a novel I\u2019d recommended to him. It turned out that this one, the second of three we\u2019d try, did not sell fiction. Jenkins did a lap anyway, searching for a book of photography by Roy DeCarava, whose iconic images of midcentury Harlem served as a visual reference for \u201cBeale Street\u201d and appear at the beginning and end of the film. On our way back to the car, we passed a boutique where Jenkins stopped to inquire after the owner: Had she had her baby yet? She had. Jenkins conveyed his congratulations. For a man who considers being alone a comfortable mode of existence, he makes reaching out to others look easy.He grew up in Knight Manor (also known as the Village), a housing project built close to the larger Liberty Square projects. His mother was addicted to crack, a fact that Jenkins is both open about and firm in not expounding upon. When \u201cMoonlight\u201d had its premiere, he told me, \u201cWe rented a theater just for her to go see the film, and on the day of, she decided she could not see it. Probably my fault. I should have flown back.\u201d Something previously open about Jenkins\u2019s posture \u2014 the set of his shoulders, the steadiness of his gaze \u2014 closed off as he told me this. Later, he says, his mother happened upon a bootleg copy of the film at a corner store; she bought it and watched at home. \u201cWhat I see in that,\u201d Jenkins says, \u201cis she just wanted to watch it by herself in an environment she could control. She actually complimented Naomie\u2019s performance\u201d \u2014 Naomie Harris, who plays the main character\u2019s troubled mother. \u201cSay of that what you will.\u201dKnight Manor was torn down, and a new campus for Miami Northwestern high school built on top of it. Jenkins would attend classes there, preparing for the future atop his own demolished childhood home \u2014 though he doesn\u2019t recall giving this symbolism much thought. Of his home life during these years he reveals little, though he alludes to it often. \u201cI grew up in a certain kind of way,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a crutch. I started therapy, I stopped. I should start it again. It\u2019s a crutch.\u201d His reluctance to explain further may also reflect his general disinterest in creating a public persona, and in the self-mythologizing that goes with it. \u201cIt was what was so difficult about everything that happened with \u2018Moonlight,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not smart enough to say as much as I have to say about the film without revealing things about myself. But that\u2019s the last thing I ever want to do.\u201dIn high school Jenkins played football, got good grades, made it to senior year. He had been admitted to the University of Florida, but after a trip to visit F.S.U. in Tallahassee, \u201cI thought: This is the blackest place in America. I gotta be here.\u201d In Tallahassee, he lived with high school friends and intended to pursue a creative-writing degree \u2014 he used to be obsessed with the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop \u2014 until one day he walked by a sign for the film school and had a change of heart. He began pursuing a dual degree. \u201cI remember my first short film,\u201d he says. \u201cI put my roommate in it, and it was a strange film. We shot it on a Bolex\u201d \u2014 a spring-wound camera associated with avant-garde film \u2014 \u201cso it wasn\u2019t like a narrative. It was more experimental.\u201d His roommates, he says, \u201cjust looked at me like they thought I had lost my mind.\u201d In the film department, though, Jenkins began making connections with the collaborators he\u2019d work with over the next two decades: McMillon and Sanders; James Laxton, the cinematographer for all his feature-length films; and Romanski and Mark Ceryak, two of his partners at the production company Pastel.After watching other students\u2019 work, Jenkins didn\u2019t think he had the technical ability to compete. \u201cDigital filmmaking wasn\u2019t anywhere near what it is now,\u201d he says; working on film, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t see what you were doing. There\u2019s no playback on set. You can\u2019t shoot it and then immediately pull it up on the memory card.\u201d The filmmaker needed solid knowledge from the start. Jenkins took a year away from the film program to study the craft on his own, finishing his creative-writing credits in the meantime. He moved in with Laxton. The popular directors to emulate in their program were those who made big-budget, Spielbergian features. Jenkins watched foreign art-house cinema in hopes of finding an alternative aesthetic approach. \u201cI remember we\u2019d have running DVDs playing in the background,\u201d Laxton told me. \u201cAnd as people would come in and out the house, we\u2019d kind of sit down and talk about it.\u201d Before that year, Jenkins would have named \u201cDie Hard\u201d as his favorite film. After, it was the Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai\u2019s stylized, lovesick \u201cChungking Express.\u201dWhen Jenkins returned to the program he wrote and directed the short film \u201cMy Josephine,\u201d a mostly subtitled account of an Arab immigrant couple who own a laundromat and wash American flags for free after the Sept. 11 attacks. Over wine at a bar near his apartment, Jenkins recalled making it: \u201cThat\u2019s me as a dude who grew up in the hood!\u201d he said, his face alight once again. \u201cThat\u2019s not me now, 20 years removed from the hood. That\u2019s me, you know what I mean? And it\u2019s taking my experience of being somebody from the hood who now is a fish out of water in this academic setting, in this film consortium, taking that feeling and putting it into these things. It was empowering.\u201dAfter graduation, the director Darnell Martin gave Jenkins his first film job, as her assistant on the set of the TV movie \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God.\u201d His work on \u201cMy Josephine,\u201d she told me, had \u201cso much poetry in it. Visually it was really stunning.\u201d Here was an avenue through which Jenkins could grapple with feelings he otherwise preferred to leave unexamined. \u201cI think when I found film,\u201d he said, \u201cI found a way \u2014 I still hide a bit \u2014 but a way to not hide as much. I felt like I could put these things into the work because it\u2019s the movie. It\u2019s not me.\u201dOn a very hot August day, Jenkins sat in a color-grading studio in Greenwich Village with Laxton and the colorist Alex Bickel. The big screen at the other end of the room showed a scene at Showmans Jazz Club in Harlem. The characters Joseph and Frank, played by the veteran actors Colman Domingo and Michael Beach, sat at the far end of the bar. The room was realistically smoke-filled for the early \u201970s, but too smoky for the purposes of the film. Jenkins and Laxton took turns guiding Bickel on how to fix the problem. They moved on to a close-up of Beach\u2019s face, its topography made more intense by his look of dejection. Jenkins made a noise of approval. \u201cIt was like Take 3 of the zoom,\u201d he said, \u201cand he just locked in.\u201dJenkins enjoys moments when his actors make direct eye contact with the camera. He and Laxton are in agreement on the power of this sustained looking, how holding the camera on an actor can bring out a host of emotions in the viewer. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a dark theater with 300 people sitting next to you,\u201d Laxton said, \u201cand you have someone looking at you from a big screen, I think it does something to you as an audience member.\u201d Alfred Hitchcock employed these sorts of shots, as did Jonathan Demme (who can forget Hannibal Lecter\u2019s stare?), but unlike those filmmakers, Jenkins and Laxton rarely shoot theirs during moments of great emotional agitation. Instead they catch their characters at ease, quiet. \u201cBarry captures silence in a way that we don\u2019t see much, and we especially don\u2019t see that much in the African-American film experience,\u201d Mahershala Ali, who won a best-supporting-actor Oscar for playing the drug-dealer-cum-father-figure in \u201cMoonlight,\u201d told me. \u201cYou usually don\u2019t see black people holding peace and occupying silence, having to fill those voids in that way.\u201dJenkins shoots these moments intuitively, waiting until he feels something. \u201cI\u2019m not directing them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are just giving me this thing. And sometimes you can look at an actor and see, Oh, there\u2019s the soul.\u201d And if they\u2019re comfortable enough, he says, they can look directly into the camera without losing that soul. \u201cInstead they\u2019re going to give it to the audience.\u201d KiKi Layne, whose starring role as Tish in \u201cBeale Street\u201d marks her first foray into film from theater, described it as looking into a black hole: \u201cI think at one point I told him that \u2018Man, this feels so strange\u2019 and he was like, \u2018I know, but I need it, I need it.\u2019\u2009\u201d The actors don\u2019t know where these shots will wind up in the film, and neither, necessarily, does Jenkins, at the time. Later, though, the emotions viewers read on the actors\u2019 faces \u2014 a close-up of Fonny near the end of the film goes from anxious and unsure to settled \u2014 feel made for the precise moment when they appear on screen.These looks don\u2019t quite break the fourth wall, because the actors are not regarding the audience. In \u201cBeale Street,\u201d they\u2019re most often gazing at someone they love. For nonblack audience members, it might be the first time they\u2019ve had a black person direct such a gaze their way; Jenkins offers a glimpse at a world previously hidden to them. For a black viewer, there\u2019s more likely a kind of recognition: I know that face, although I have never seen this actor before. Or, if the actor is one you\u2019re familiar with, it can go the opposite direction, letting you see the person anew. Regina King, who plays Tish\u2019s mother in the film, has played a mother or wife as many times as I have fingers, over decades. But who was this woman on the screen, staring at her reflection in a mirror, summoning her courage, while also staring at me? Typecasting actors isn\u2019t simply about having them play a role they have played before; it\u2019s about locking them into the same aesthetic representation of that role. \u201cHe knows that it\u2019s not just his film,\u201d King told me. \u201cHe can\u2019t do this without the talent of other people, and he allows those talents to shine.\u201dDuring the festival season leading up to the theatrical release of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d Jenkins directed an episode of the first season of the Netflix series \u201cDear White People,\u201d revolving around an actor named Marque Richardson; his character has a gun pulled on him by campus police officers, and by the episode\u2019s end he breaks down, crying. I have personally known Marque Richardson for 15 years and have watched him act in all sorts of roles. This episode was the first time he ever felt a stranger to me on screen.This level of artistic freedom is hard to come by in the world of Hollywood-financed film, he thinks, but the possibility of leading such a life \u2014 not feeling obligated to have one foot planted in the role of presenter \u2014 captivates him. He could also see himself teaching film to others in 15 years. In the short term, though, he is working on a forthcoming limited-series adaptation of Colson Whitehead\u2019s \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d for Amazon, and a screenplay based on the life of the gold-medal-winning boxer Claressa Shields. \u201cI wish I had taken a break after the Oscars and all that stuff, but I just went right into this movie, and right into the writers\u2019 room for \u2018The Underground Railroad.\u2019 I didn\u2019t really process all that stuff. And now this movie is finally ending, and I think it\u2019s time for a moment to process.\u201dIt was our last few minutes together, and I wanted to know \u2014 having heard him speak of a more unfettered artistic life, and witnessing him bring happiness to others with such ease \u2014 what exactly made him happy. \u201cI\u2019m never happy, man \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s just the case,\u201d he said. He used to think he didn\u2019t deserve to be. Then: \u201cI think making other people happy makes me happy.\u201d He recalled helping Alex Hibbert, who plays the child version of the main character in \u201cMoonlight,\u201d find his footing as an actor. \u201cWhen other people do things on my sets that either they didn\u2019t believe they could do, or understand they could do, or that surprises them?\u201d That, he said, was amazing. It was a matter of helping them tap into the ineffable. \u201cWhat I say to the actors, if they ask, is that it\u2019s not about a certain meaning; it\u2019s definitely about a certain feeling. How can we work together to create this feeling, even if the feeling is not knowable?\u201cI really want that simple life, you know?\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why I fell in love with this book.\u201d He quoted the moment in Baldwin\u2019s novel when Fonny, the young sculptor jailed for a crime he swears he didn\u2019t commit, says he only needs art and the love of his woman to survive: \u201c\u2009\u2018I got two things in my life, man \u2014 I got my wood and stone, and I got Tish.\u2019\u2009\u201d Despite the increasing complexity that comes with a successful Hollywood career, Jenkins desires the same. \u201cI have my wood and stone now,\u201d he said.Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beto O\u2019Rourke Attacks Ted Cruz as \u2018Dishonest\u2019 in Debate in Senate Race", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN ANTONIO \u2014 Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, who has fallen behind Senator Ted Cruz in the polls in their hotly contested Senate race, turned sharply aggressive in their second debate on Tuesday night as he attacked Mr. Cruz\u2019s honesty and character while the two clashed over abortion, climate change and other red-versus-blue divides.Using phrases like \u201cTed Cruz is for Ted Cruz\u201d and \u201call talk and no action,\u201d and questioning whether the senator had delivered any results for Texas, Mr. O\u2019Rourke took his most personal shot at his opponent when Mr. Cruz expressed skepticism about climate change and argued that Mr. O\u2019Rourke supported higher taxes on oil. The congressman invoked an attack line that Donald J. Trump had used against Mr. Cruz in the 2016 presidential race.\u201cSenator Cruz is not going to be honest with you,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cHe\u2019s dishonest, and it\u2019s why the president called him Lyin\u2019 Ted, and it\u2019s why the nickname stuck \u2014 because it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s clear Congressman O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pollsters have told him to come out on the attack,\u201d Mr. Cruz replied.In their first debate last month, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was largely reserved and anything but aggressive. He had trouble boiling down his expansive responses into memorable zingers, and his just-good-enough performance most likely played at least some role in Mr. Cruz\u2019s recent lead in the polls. On Tuesday, however, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was far sharper and edgier. He sweated more, used his hands and arms to punctuate his arguments and repeatedly cast Mr. Cruz as dishonest, ineffective, more focused on running for president than representing Texas and beholden to corporate interests.In one exchange, Mr. Cruz was asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war. Mr. Cruz said he was against it, and pivoted to talk about Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks about impeaching the president, calling his opponent \u201cthe only Democratic Senate nominee in the country who has explicitly come out for impeaching President Trump.\u201d He added that if Mr. O\u2019Rourke had his way, there would be \u201ctwo years of a partisan circus\u201d aimed at ousting the president.Mr. O\u2019Rourke replied, \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus, after your last six years in the U.S. Senate.\u201d Then he switched gears as well, to talk about Mr. Cruz\u2019s relationship with Mr. Trump, who is coming to Houston on Monday to hold a rally for Mr. Cruz.\u201cListen,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cif you have this special relationship with President Trump, then where is the result of that? You are all talk and no action.\u201dBut Mr. Cruz largely kept his cool, and even chuckled out loud at some of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s attacks. He continued to paint Mr. O\u2019Rourke as a liberal who is too radical for Texas and who wants to steer the state away from the low-tax, low-regulation mantra that Republicans view as the key to the Texas economy\u2019s success.\u201cHave you noticed in this debate he doesn\u2019t talk about what he has accomplished in Congress?\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cBecause he has scored political points rather than accomplishing victories for the people of Texas.\u201dOnly once did Mr. Cruz grow audibly frustrated \u2014 but that was aimed at one of the two moderators, Jason Whitely, a senior reporter at WFAA-TV in Dallas. Responding to a question about incivility in politics, Mr. Cruz made a point about partisanship, saying, \u201cThere is an anger, there is a rage on the far left.\u201d When Mr. Whitely tried to interject, Mr. Cruz said sharply, \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me, Jason,\u201d and then continued discussing his views on treating others with respect.\u201cThe personal attacks, the going to the gutter that is so common in politics, I\u2019ve tried not to engage in,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.The displays of fireworks aside, there was no single significant moment in the debate that seemed certain to help or hurt the two candidates with about three weeks to go to Election Day. Mr. O\u2019Rourke was clearly aiming to energize his base of voters and trying to remind Texas independents and moderates of misgivings they may have about Mr. Cruz.On Wednesday morning, President Trump weighed in on the debate, declaring his support for Mr. Cruz and calling Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u201ca flake\u2019\u2019 who was \u201cnot in the same league with Ted Cruz.\u2019\u2019The two candidates clashed from the first question, about the security of voting and whether Congress should regulate social media companies. Mr. O\u2019Rourke said that voting and the ballot box were \u201cunder attack\u201d more than \u201cany other time in our nation\u2019s history\u201d and argued that Senator Cruz had not done enough to finance greater election security measures. He also criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, given Russian\u2019s interference in the 2016 American election, and pledged to \u201cstand up\u201d to Mr. Trump while saying Mr. Cruz had not.Mr. Cruz said he had supported legislation to do more to protect American voting, but also focused on \u201cpolitical bias of big tech, of Facebook and Google\u201d and said he was concerned that social media was not protecting free political speech on social media.Mr. O\u2019Rourke also criticized Mr. Cruz for opposing the Violence Against Women Act, while the senator presented himself as a strong supporter of the #MeToo movement and victims of sexual assault and misconduct.\u201cThe #MeToo movement has done an incredible amount of good for our country,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cI believe everyone, women and men, girls and boys, need to be protected.\u201d As the father of two girls, and the son and husband of women who had careers, he noted that he helped lead a Senate effort to stop secret settlements by members of Congress over sexual harassment complaints.Mr. Cruz and Mr. O\u2019Rourke were facing off for the second and perhaps final time, as Mr. Cruz seeks to widen his lead in the polls and Mr. O\u2019Rourke tries to restore dimming Democratic hopes that he can unseat Mr. Cruz and pull off the biggest upset in modern Texas political history.The battle between Mr. Cruz and Mr. O\u2019Rourke has captivated and polarized Texas and drawn enormous interest nationwide, with the candidates raising far more money than those in typical Senate races. Mr. O\u2019Rourke raised a record-breaking $38.1 million in the last three months alone, the most of any Senate candidate ever. And he has enjoyed a kind of pop-culture celebrity status, getting a shout-out from the young El Paso soul singer Khalid at the American Music Awards and jamming on stage with Willie Nelson. On Thursday, he will appear in a live town-hall event on CNN in the border city of McAllen.Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s CNN town hall has become a contested issue. The Cruz campaign asked CNN to change the format of the event into a town-hall debate and to allow the two candidates to hold their third debate there. In a letter to CNN, Jeff Roe, Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, wrote that if they were going to spend an hour \u201con national cable news discussing and debating the issues important to Texas voters, we believe it should be on a stage with our opponent.\u201dThe network had originally invited both candidates to participate in a town hall, with each candidate appearing separately on the stage in individual segments. The Cruz campaign had accepted but later backed out, the network said. CNN said in response to the Cruz campaign request that it would convert the event into a debate if the O\u2019Rourke campaign agreed to the change.It was unclear if Mr. O\u2019Rourke was going to agree. Although three debates were originally scheduled, one of them set for Houston was postponed, and it was uncertain whether it would be rescheduled. It seemed possible that Tuesday night\u2019s debate was the final one.Texas Democrats remain cautiously optimistic, with some more cautious and others more optimistic.Few, if any, Democrats running statewide in Texas in recent decades have generated the amount of enthusiasm that Mr. O\u2019Rourke has. In the 2014 race for governor, the party\u2019s nominee, Wendy Davis, enjoyed an initial wave of excitement but then trailed the Republican, Greg Abbott, by up to 12 percentage points in the polls four months before the election, and some Democrats were publicly and privately grumbling about her campaign\u2019s missteps.Mr. O\u2019Rourke is running a tighter race and a smoother campaign, effectively turning much of his life into a social-media live stream, allowing his supporters to watch him as he drives between events and gets a haircut.\u201cHe\u2019s probably running the best campaign that\u2019s been run in Texas in my lifetime,\u201d said Garry Mauro, a former state land commissioner who was the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in Texas in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m on his Facebook. At one time yesterday he had 13,000 people watching him drive in the car.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.On Tuesday night, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was lucky to have made it into the studios at all. Before the debate, the parking attendant outside the KENS 5 television station was surprised when Mr. O\u2019Rourke pulled in driving his own vehicle. He regularly drives himself campaigning around the state. Debate night was no different.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a pass, I don\u2019t know how to get you through,\u201d the attendant told Mr. O\u2019Rourke. His wife, Amy O\u2019Rourke, sat in the car, joined by staff members. They were live-streaming the drive to the debate on his Facebook page.\u201cThis is how you know it\u2019s real,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. After some consultation, the parking attendant sent Mr. O\u2019Rourke in.\u201cThank you,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThank you for your service.\u201dHe rolled up the window.\u201cWe passed the first hurdle,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cuomo Campaigns for Fellow Democrats and Some Ask: What\u2019s Up His Sleeve?", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe surest sign of a blue wave in New York may not be the groundswell of new grass-roots groups, or the roster of insurgent candidates, or even the more-than-doubled voter turnout in September\u2019s state primary elections.It may well be the sight of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on the campaign trail, actively stumping for a Democratic State Senate.Mr. Cuomo, a centrist fond of touting his fiscal restraint, has long drawn the suspicion of some progressives who believe that he secretly opposes a Democrat-controlled Senate. Such a Senate, the theory goes, could push through long-stalled \u2014 and expensive \u2014 legislation that the governor, also a Democrat, publicly supports but privately might rather see languish.This year seems different. Invoking the threat posed by President Trump, Mr. Cuomo has rallied with several State Senate candidates on Long Island, where Democrats hope to flip at least three seats, and has headlined fund-raisers for others around the state. He announced a $2 million television and digital ad campaign for taking back the Senate, paid for by his campaign and the state Democratic Party, which he controls.\u201cThis election has never been more important, and the choice has never been clearer,\u201d the governor said in announcing the ad campaign.Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign, suggested that the governor\u2019s efforts to win back the Senate surpassed those of any of his predecessors.\u201cThere has never been as robust an effort by a governor,\u201d Ms. Lever said.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s support, both financial and rhetorical, could be enough to sway the outcome in some of the most closely watched races, especially on Long Island, where voters skew more moderate and split almost in half for Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump in 2016. The governor is popular among Democrats there, especially for his pledges to keep property taxes under control.But in a sign of just how much wariness Mr. Cuomo\u2019s stance related to the Senate has inspired, doubts about the sincerity of his efforts have continued to follow him \u2014 spurred this time, perhaps counterintuitively, by the very visibility of his campaigning.Some members of the left-most wing of the Democratic Party have expressed concern that Mr. Cuomo\u2019s generosity on Long Island may have a worrisome \u2014 and, for the governor, calculated \u2014 effect: creating a cohort of indebted senators on whom he can lean next year to stymie legislation he finds unpalatable.Mia Pearlman, a co-leader of the grass-roots group True Blue NY, said that when a coalition of similar organizations was deciding whom to endorse for the general election, it considered, among other things, a candidate\u2019s ties to the governor.\u201cOne of the things we did think about was their independence from Governor Cuomo,\u201d Ms. Pearlman said. \u201cThere are a lot of rumors flying about, \u2018What is Governor Cuomo\u2019s strategy for the upcoming legislative session?\u2019\u201dThe coalition ultimately endorsed only some of the Democratic challengers; it did not back several candidates whom Mr. Cuomo had recruited.\u201cAm I concerned? I\u2019m concerned. Am I surprised? I am not surprised,\u201d said Jessica Ramos, a Senate candidate in Queens who has said she believed Mr. Cuomo had supported a Republican-controlled Senate. \u201cI am not surprised to hear that there\u2019s maneuvering around getting state senators to agree to things before even being elected.\u201dMs. Lever said the governor had made it \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that his motivation for flipping the Senate lies in combating Mr. Trump, a popular campaign theme for Mr. Cuomo. The governor reiterated that point in an interview, attributing his engagement to what he called the Trump administration\u2019s meddling in state affairs.\u201cThis situation is unprecedented, because the federal government historically dealt with federal issues,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cNow it is interfering in fundamental state issues.\u201dSenate Democrats, who in the past have criticized Mr. Cuomo\u2019s lukewarm efforts on their behalf, have acknowledged a heartier effort this year.But some also noted that the governor had not contributed any money to the Senate Democrats\u2019 general campaign fund, as of the most updated campaign finance filings; while Mr. Cuomo has advertised raising $500,000 for Senate candidates through fund-raisers he headlined, that money flowed to the state party, not to the candidates themselves. The party can then disburse the money as it chooses.As of the most recent filing on Oct. 5, the state party had given money to only two Democratic Senate candidates for the general election: Louis D\u2019Amaro and Monica Martinez, both challengers on Long Island. But the $27,000 contribution to Mr. D\u2019Amaro seemed to be a loan: Mr. D\u2019Amaro\u2019s campaign transferred $27,000 of its own back to the state party.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign brushed off scrutiny of those numbers, noting that they did not include the $2 million ad campaign, which was announced after the most recent filing deadline, or the governor\u2019s efforts on fund-raising, staff deployment and data sharing.Still, the progressive flank\u2019s concern has seemed to resonate with candidates, who recognize the power of Mr. Cuomo\u2019s support but may also be wary of alienating the increasingly vocal activist wing of their party. At least one Long Island campaign reached out privately to the grass-roots coalition to reassure members that the candidate was independent, according to several members of the coalition.Indeed, even the most ardent critics of Mr. Cuomo acknowledge the constraints of pragmatism and political reality.Susan Kang, a co-founder of No IDC NY, another group in the coalition, said she would not have expected any candidates to turn down the governor\u2019s support.\u201cThey need to take alliances and help where they can,\u201d Ms. Kang said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re more effective in the Senate than not in the Senate.\u201dBut progressives also expressed optimism that the same Democratic energy that may have jump-started Mr. Cuomo\u2019s action this year could also free activists and candidates from having to rely upon Mr. Cuomo\u2019s help at all.\u201cThe grass-roots pressure has changed the game.

{"Headline": "First Up if Democrats Win: Campaign and Ethics Changes, Infrastructure and Drug Prices", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Democrats would use their first month in the House majority to advance sweeping changes to future campaign and ethics laws, requiring the disclosure of shadowy political donors, outlawing the gerrymandering of congressional districts and restoring key enforcement provisions to the Voting Rights Act, top Democratic leaders said on Tuesday.If they win, they would then turn to infrastructure investment and the climbing costs of prescription drugs, answering voter demands and challenging President Trump\u2019s willingness to work on shared policy priorities with a party he has vilified. The idea, said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader, is to show voters that Democrats are a governing party, not the leftist mob that Mr. Trump describes \u2014 and to extend an arm of cooperation to the president after an electoral rebuke.\u201cThis is going to be a bitter pill for them all to swallow when they see the election results, if they turn out as we expect,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said in an extended interview on Tuesday, predicting a Democratic wave. She added of the prospect Mr. Trump would collaborate, \u201cI don\u2019t think he himself knows what he is going to do.\u201dAs Mr. Trump spends the final week of a scorched-earth midterm campaign rallying his base around hot-button immigration issues and depicting Democrats as a security threat, Ms. Pelosi and her deputies sought to project a more modest and politically popular agenda on issues ranging from health care to criminal justice changes. They said they would work to improve the Affordable Care Act, for example, rather than rushing to replace it with a single-payer health care plan.And even as they ready an onslaught of investigations into alleged malfeasance by the president and his administration, they said common ground could be found with Mr. Trump.\u201cWe\u2019re still going to have Donald Trump as president, so obviously that\u2019s going to limit to an extent what we can accomplish in the short term,\u201d Representative Jim McGovern, the Massachusetts Democrat who would be in line to chair the Rules Committee, said in an interview. \u201cBut one thing we can accomplish is we can run the place like professionals and restore some integrity to the institution.\u201dDemocrats, of course, may fall short of a majority on Tuesday, and if they do net the 23 seats they need, there is no guarantee Mr. Trump, or Republicans who are expected to maintain control of the Senate, will cooperate. Mr. Trump has shown an interest in working with Democrats in the past, on issues like gun control and immigration, only to backtrack, and he could emerge from Election Day determined to shun Democrats.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, would have his own motivations to bypass or block House proposals as he blockaded legislation pushed by President Barack Obama. Then there is the challenge of reining in the most energized liberal lawmakers for whom anything short of a presidential impeachment would be a compromise too far.But after eight years in the minority, most Democrats believe they will need to do more than embarrass the White House with subpoenas and investigative hearings if they want to be more than a one-term majority and reclaim the presidency in 2020. Ms. Pelosi made clear her party would only bend so far. Democrats are not \u201cgoing to lowest common denominator to get a presidential signature,\u201d she said.Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland, Ms. Pelosi\u2019s longtime No. 2, said Mr. Trump\u2019s stances would speak for themselves to 2020 voters. \u201cThe best politics for us is trying to work toward adopting the best policy for the American people,\u201d he addedAs they talked up possible bipartisan initiatives, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Hoyer said that Democrats would push through \u2014 on party line votes if necessary \u2014 other more liberal agenda items they say enjoy broad public support but have been stymied for years by Republican majorities. They include gun safety legislation, a bill to give permanent legal status and a path to citizenship to young, undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children, and the Equality Act, which would amend longstanding civil rights laws to extend legal protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.Ms. Pelosi said for the first time that she would urge her caucus to revive a select committee focused on climate change similar to the one that Democrats funded from 2007 to early 2011 to \u201cprepare the way with evidence\u201d for energy conservation and other climate change mitigation legislation. Republicans defunded the panel when they took the majority, but Ms. Pelosi said it was clearly still needed to educate the public about the impact of more frequent extreme weather events.\u201cThe template for 2020 is getting built in the House,\u201d Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva of Arizona, a progressive in line to chair the Natural Resources Committee, said summing up another Democratic view.Democrats have also prepared detailed, more liberal approaches for a $1 trillion infrastructure package and how to slow the increases in prescription drug costs, but indicated that they would steer proposals through the regular committee process in an effort to try to build a consensus with Republicans first. Mr. Hoyer said Democrats and Republicans would disagree over how to fund infrastructure spending, but they could bridge the gap with Mr. Trump\u2019s help.\u201cHis objectives are objectives that we share,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he really means that, then there is an opening for us to work together.\u201dAt least in theory, Democrats view election and ethics reform as another issue of potential collaboration. But their legislative package of more than a dozen bills, overseen by Representative John Sarbanes of Maryland, looks more like a retort to Mr. Trump\u2019s popular campaign claims that he would \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d in Washington \u2014 a difference Democrats have weaponized on the campaign trail.In an echo of actions they took in 2007, the last time they assumed House control, Democrats plan to use a package of rules governing the chamber prepared by Mr. McGovern to take unilateral steps that they say will tighten ethical standards, including in a nod to an ongoing ethics scandal roiling Republicans, a ban on House members sitting on corporate boards.Together, Ms. Pelosi said, putting those efforts first would \u201ccaffeinate\u201d the Democrats\u2019 agenda, even if Republicans in the Senate do not take up the legislation.\u201cWhen people know the priority that we are giving to the integrity and government piece, it increases the confidence they have that we can do what we said,\u201d Ms. Pelosi said.Chief among the legislation\u2019s provisions would be a measure by Representative Terri Sewell of Alabama that would amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to comply with a 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder that gutted the bill\u2019s key enforcement provision. In issuing its 5-4 decision, the court urged Congress to replace the scheme under which the federal government had overseen changes to election laws in states with a history of voting rights abuses.Republicans in control of Congress at the time took a pass, and Democrats believe Ms. Sewell\u2019s bill could help counteract a new wave of election laws across the South that have limited access to the polls.Another measure, written by Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, would require political nonprofit 501(c)(4)s to disclose the identity of most of their donors for the first time. Democrats would like to go further, passing a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United decision and restore to Congress the power to limit money in politics, but those political prospects appear slim.Yet another provision, written by Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, would require all states to establish independent commissions to draw congressional districts. Several states already employ such bodies, but gerrymandering of political boundaries is the norm in most states, allowing the party in control of state government to create the most favorable jurisdictions for its congressional elections every decade, distorting the will of voters, Democrats argue.Also included are a series of bills tightening restrictions on federal lobbyists, beefing up the executive branch\u2019s Office of Government Ethics, which clashed with Mr. Trump early in his presidency, and requiring the president and vice president to divest any business holdings to prevent a possible conflict of interest.Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Wall Street Is Booming Under Trump. But Many of Its Donors Are Embracing Democrats.", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Charles Myers, the chairman of a financial advisory firm, hosted four relatively unknown Democratic congressional candidates at his Midtown Manhattan home last month, he netted more money than he can remember collecting from an event that wasn\u2019t headlined by a presidential candidate.\u201cMore than ever in my 26-year career on Wall Street, donors are willing to look way beyond concerns of overregulation from Democrats,\u201d said Mr. Myers, a longtime Democratic fund-raiser. They just want to elect \u201cDemocrats to serve as a check\u201d on President Trump.The stock market may be booming. Unemployment is hitting record lows. Republicans pushed through $1.5 trillion in tax cuts.But despite all that, for the first time in a decade, the broader financial community is on pace to give more money to Democratic congressional candidates and incumbents than their Republican counterparts, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign donations.Some of the same grass-roots energy coursing through the Democratic Party \u2014 House candidates from Kentucky to Montana to New York are reporting record sums of small donations \u2014 has spilled into the corporate boardrooms of American finance, even amid increasingly hostile rhetoric from Democrats in Washington and on the campaign trail toward Wall Street.\u201cWhen one party controls all the levers, it is a lot easier for the opposing party to motivate donors,\u201d said Marc Short, the former Trump White House director of legislative affairs, who has deep relationships in the donor world. \u201cIt\u2019s both money and activism. But obviously much of the money comes from Wall Street.\u201dIn interviews with two dozen Wall Street executives, fund-raisers, donors and those who raise money from them, Democrats described an extraordinary level of investment and excitement from the finance sector. And many Republicans fretted about a softening of donor enthusiasm \u2014 Mr. Short warned of \u201ccomplacency\u201d \u2014 in what has long been one of the party\u2019s most critical and reliable sources of campaign cash.The numbers are stark.That figure will shift, possibly substantially, when candidates reveal their latest fund-raising hauls later this month. But Democrats have already surpassed their 2012 and 2014 totals, and most Republicans with ties to Wall Street described a grim political outlook, even as the confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court brought renewed energy nationally to their party.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a midterm election coming up that looks right now fairly bleak for the Republicans,\u201d said Stephen Moore, the conservative economist who founded the Club for Growth and maintains close ties to Wall Street donors.\u201cWall Street is \u2014 and corporate America is \u2014 pretty famous for hedging their bets,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cThey just want to follow winners. They just want to make sure they have access to the people who win. This is no exception.\u201dSome Republicans, including Mr. Moore, cited residual anger from the tax-cut bill, which eliminated a key deduction for state and local taxes in blue states such as New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where most of Wall Street\u2019s big earners live. Others pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s personality and his social and cultural agenda that has proved divisive, especially among college-educated voters.\u201cA lot of Mitt Romney donors are doing nothing,\u201d said one New York financial executive and Republican fund-raiser, who, like many, spoke on condition of anonymity to maintain relationships with contributors. \u201cA lot of these guys just completely disappeared.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Many midlevel donors seem to be simply sitting out this cycle, according to Republican officials; some big contributors have been slower or more reluctant to give ahead of expected losses.From donors in just the securities and investment sector, Democratic congressional incumbents and candidates have so far received $39.3 million in 2018, compared with $28 million for Republicans. That is a reversal from 2014, when Democrats raised $28 million and Republicans $41.5 million. In 2018, 15 of the top 20 congressional recipients of securities and investment industry cash are Democrats; in 2014, 15 of the top 20 were Republicans.The totals do not include independent super PAC giving, and the next round of disclosures, which will run through the end of September, will be released later this month.Despite the balance sheet shifting to the left, Wall Street remains a wellspring of financial support for Republicans. Political action committee money from Wall Street, which makes up about a third of total giving so far, still tilts Republican. And Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity Blackstone Group and an adviser to Mr. Trump, for instance, has already donated $7.25 million to super PACs benefiting House and Senate Republicans.In September, Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and a senior White House adviser, spoke to a gathering of top Republican Party donors in Manhattan that included some of the billionaire titans of Wall Street. Among them: Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade; Daniel S. Loeb, the hedge fund manager of Third Point L.L.C.; Charles R. Schwab, the founder of Charles Schwab Corporation; and Paul Singer, the hedge fund magnate who runs Elliott Management Corporation.And this month, Speaker Paul Ryan is scheduled to brief a small group of top New York-area donors at the office of Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of American International Group, according to an invitation obtained by The New York Times.Mr. Wentworth questioned the deductions provision of the tax bill, among other policies pursued by a Republican-controlled Washington. \u201cIt was almost like the New York metropolitan area \u2014 we had a target on our back,\u201d he said.Giving to once-obscure House candidates is suddenly in vogue, with Democratic donors saying it has never-seen-before cachet in finance circles.\u201cWhat I have never seen in my lifetime is the level of energy for all these local races,\u201d said Orin Kramer, a veteran Democratic fund-raiser and founder of a hedge fund. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such an appetite for candidates who people have never heard of.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of degree,\u201d added Mr. Kramer, who has contributed to the House Victory Project and hosted events of his own. \u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon that hasn\u2019t existed before.\u201dOf course, in the age of super PACs, billionaire donors can still have an outsize impact with a single check. And Mr. Trump can conceivably make up any missing donors on Wall Street with financial support elsewhere, just as he drove different voters to the polls in 2016 as some traditional Republicans stayed home.The single biggest donor of the cycle is the former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who made his multibillion-dollar fortune selling computer terminals to Wall Street. He has pledged $100 million for the Democrats. The largest Republican contributor is the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. He and his wife have contributed $55 million to Republican super PACs.To rally Wall Street support, Republican leaders have been sounding the alarm not just about the broader threat of a Nancy Pelosi-led House, but specifically about who is in line to chair the powerful Financial Services Committee: Representative Maxine Waters of California, a liberal firebrand whom Mr. Trump has also taken to attacking by name.\u201cFinance people \u2014 when they find out that Maxine Waters is going to be in charge of finance \u2014 they panic,\u201d said John Catsimatidis, a billionaire Trump donor in New York, who was one of the few who said he said he saw no softening among Republican donor interest on Wall Street.Last month, when Mr. Ryan briefed members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce about the stakes of the election and the regulations that Democratic control could unleash, he name-checked potential Democratic committee chairs, including Ms. Waters, according to two attendees.For Democrats, Mr. Trump himself has proved a unifying message when seeking out financial industry contributors.\u201cYou would expect, with the economy doing as well as it is today, that there would be a desire to keep the status quo,\u201d said Thomas R. Nides, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton now working on Wall Street. But he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think people care. They\u2019re worried about the direction of the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Problems With Britain\u2019s New Digital Tax", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe UK\u2019s finance minister has taken the plunge with a new plan for taxing technology giants \u2014 but it is flawed.Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, on Monday unveiled a 2 percent tax on the revenue that big search engines, social-media platforms and online marketplaces earn in the country.The digital-services tax appears to target Amazon, Facebook and the Alphabet business Google. All of those companies have been criticized for shifting revenue and costs between jurisdictions, allowing them to minimize profit where tax would otherwise be burdensome. Operating in the virtual world \u2014 and with the resources available to three of the six largest public companies on the planet \u2014 makes that easier than for traditional businesses that have a physical presence.The European Union is considering a similar tax at 3 percent. That is billed as a stopgap, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development working on a revamp of cross-border tax rules that would allow the value added to a virtual business by a country\u2019s citizens \u2014 be it via their data or online purchases \u2014 to be identified and taxed in that jurisdiction. But that\u2019s a long shot.Meanwhile, there are problems with Mr. Hammond\u2019s measure.First, the tax may not be aggressive enough. Take Facebook as an example: It generated over 2.2 billion British pounds, or about $2.9 billion, of British digital ad revenue in 2017, according to the market research company eMarketer. A 2 percent slice of that would have earned the government some \u00a345 million. Facebook\u2019s British subsidiary had a bill for cash corporate taxes of just \u00a316 million in the same year.That looks like a step in the right direction. But Facebook\u2019s consolidated pretax profit margin topped 50 percent last year. Assume the same for the United Kingdom under a new global regime with a 20 percent tax on profit, and the company could have been on the hook for well over \u00a3200 million. So it might be better for companies to take a chances with Mr. Hammond\u2019s levy.Another difficulty is that the biggest companies caught by such a tax are based in the United States. Rightly or not, that smacks of protectionism, sour grapes or both. And Washington has little incentive to negotiate, especially if it might lose some of its own tax revenue.Mr. Hammond is also risking a backlash just as Britain heads for Brexit. It\u2019s bold to try to provoke wider change \u2014 but in this case, it might not work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mnuchin Defends Trip to Saudi Arabia Amid Uproar Over Khashoggi Killing", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday defended his decision to meet with Saudi officials this week, saying his trip was aimed at reinforcing ties at a critical moment, as the United States tries to ratchet up pressure on Iran.Mr. Mnuchin, speaking during a stop in Jerusalem, said the economic and strategic relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia was too important to be derailed by an international uproar over the Saudis\u2019 killing of a dissident journalist.Mr. Mnuchin described what happened to Mr. Khashoggi as a \u201cterrible situation\u201d and said that the United States would not go easy on countries that violate human rights even if they have close economic ties.\u201cI think the human rights issues are very important issues, and I think that the United States needs to play a leadership role on human rights,\u201d he said.But Mr. Mnuchin said it was important to wait for more facts to emerge before determining if Saudi Arabia should face sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Act \u2014 which authorizes the government to penalize human rights offenders \u2014 and added that it was \u201cpremature\u201d to even discuss sanctions at this point.\u201cI did not think it was appropriate to go and speak at the conference,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in an interview on Sunday.But he said the United States must preserve its ties to Saudi Arabia, particularly as the United States tries to stop Iran from participating in the global financial system. \u201cWe have an important relationship with Saudi, focused on combating terrorist financing and focused on our common interests of stopping Iran\u2019s spread of both terrorism and other issues,\u201d he said, adding that he was planning to \u201cmeet with my counterparts and continue to focus on what\u2019s in the Treasury\u2019s domain, as it relates to this issue.\u201dDespite the global outrage at Saudi Arabia, Mr. Mnuchin said he did not intend to scold his Saudi counterparts about rights abuses.\u201cI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be speaking with the president before I go there,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he has a message that he wants me to deliver, I will obviously deliver it. That is not the focus of my trip.\u201dWhile Mr. Trump has acknowledged that the Saudi government was not forthright in its explanations of what happened to Mr. Khashoggi, he has continued to express admiration for Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince, as someone who loves his country.The prospect of the United States\u2019 imposing sanctions on Saudi Arabia has raised concern that the country could slow oil production in retaliation. Mr. Mnuchin said, however, that he had no reason to believe that Saudi Arabia would not honor its oil-production commitments.Mr. Mnuchin planned to visit the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, which the United States leads with Saudi Arabia, and meet with the Saudi finance minister, the energy minister and other economic officials in Riyadh.A year ago, Mr. Mnuchin made his first trip as secretary to Saudi Arabia to speak at the investor conference and unveil the terrorist financing center. He said that the initiative still needed more work and that he planned to keep coming back to oversee its progress.In Israel, the Treasury secretary was on the first stop of a six-country trip through the Middle East focused on the battle against terrorist financing. He is also visiting Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait.Earlier on Sunday, he met with the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to discuss joint efforts to corral Iran.With Mr. Mnuchin by his side, Mr. Netanyahu said in his office: \u201cPressure is the only thing that arrests the forward movement of the Iranian nuclear program, and pressure is the only thing that rolls back Iran\u2019s aggression in the region.\u201dThe United States withdrew from the multicountry Iran nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, this year, and sanctions against Iran are to be reimposed next month. That has made preserving strong ties with Saudi Arabia even more important, as the United States is relying on the Saudis to increase oil production to make up for lost access to Iranian oil.In the interview on Sunday, Mr. Mnuchin said that he had not yet seen a workaround that concerned him, but that he was monitoring such efforts.\u201cWe very much intend to enforce our sanctions,\u201d he said.The sanctions are scheduled to go into effect on Nov. 4.Mr. Mnuchin is also engaged in delicate talks with a financial messaging service that is run by a Belgian cooperative called Swift. The service plays a crucial role in moving money around the international banking system by notifying banks when their customers intend to move money. As a result of the United States sanctions, it could soon face penalties for remaining connected with Iran.Although a resolution is still in the works, Mr. Mnuchin said that the Treasury Department would ensure that Swift would not be used for prohibited transactions.Advertisement"}

The drop-off coincided with one of the sharpest price hikes in the city: The median sales price in the area more than doubled, from $420,000 in 2012 to $865,000 in 2017, according to StreetEasy, the real-estate data website.Affordability is not the only factor that influences the shifting birthrate, Dr. Beveridge said. In Borough Park, for instance, the consistently high birthrate can be partially attributed to the large Hasidic community, whose members tend to have more children. But there is also evidence that families getting priced out of wealthier areas are leading the shift.Martine Langatta, 30, an artist, and her husband, Julian Cavin, 28, were living with family in Park Slope, Brooklyn, before the arrival of their son, Valentine, who is now 10 months old. Mr. Cavin, who was born and raised in the neighborhood, wanted to stay there, but the couple could not afford anything in the area.\u201cEven though it\u2019s such a huge city, there aren\u2019t a lot of options,\u201d said Mr. Cavin, an owner of the Williamsburg branch of the Italian specialty store Regina\u2019s Grocery.Their agent, Ugo Russino of Warburg Realty, suggested Sunset Park, about 20 blocks south of where they were living, where homes traded at a fraction of the cost. Last year, they bought a one-bedroom on the park for $400,000; a similar home in Park Slope might have cost $600,000 to $700,000, Mr. Russino said.The neighborhood\u2019s diversity, with thriving Hispanic and Chinese communities, was a major draw for the couple, whose morning routine now involves walking past 7 a.m. soccer games and Tai-chi classes in the park.The move to more far-flung neighborhoods also reflects a fundamental question for some: Who needs Manhattan?\u201cHow the city functions and flows, and how it was set up two generations ago, is kind of getting turned on its head,\u201d said Brad Bateman, an agent with Stribling & Associates, who has noticed an uptick in the number of young families living and also working in Brooklyn.Maria Suarez, 30, and her husband, Franco Salgado, 25, work in Red Hook, near the industrial Brooklyn waterfront, where Ms. Suarez is the production manager at EFS Designs, a textile and screen printing shop. They were renting a one-bedroom apartment nearby for $1,750 a month, but with their first child on the way, they needed more space, Ms. Suarez said, and the limited two-bedroom options they saw were too expensive, too small or both.Now the couple lives in a two-bedroom ground-floor apartment in a Sunset Park brownstone, where they pay $2,200 a month \u2014 around $300 a month less than they would have paid for any of the two-bedrooms they saw in Red Hook. They have already scoped out a number of child-friendly perks: rows of nearby markets and mom-and-pop restaurants, a public pool that was packed this summer and friendly neighbors. (Their daughter, Isabella, was born in early October.) Also, \u201ca lot of lovely grandmas,\u201d Ms. Suarez said. \u201cThey\u2019re super-sweet and always ask how I am. They seem to know a lot about the kids in the neighborhood.\u201dHow long Sunset Park will remain an affordable option for young families priced out of other parts of Brooklyn or Manhattan is unclear. In the past five years, \u201cprices have basically doubled,\u201d said Mr. Bracichowicz, the Corcoran agent. \u201cNot a day goes by that we don\u2019t count our blessings, that we bought when we bought,\u201d said Brenda Morales, 42, who works in real estate financing. She and her husband, Richard Velez, bought a three-bedroom home in Morris Park in the mid-$500,000s this year. From 2012 to 2017, the median sales price in the area rose to roughly $453,000, up 22 percent, according to StreetEasy. Ms. Morales, a Bronx native, Mr. Velez and their nine-year-old son, Ian, left a \u201ccooped-up\u201d apartment in Co-op City for the suburban feel of Morris Park. She said their new block has a number of families with young children, and she expects the area to get pricier soon: A Metro-North station is being planned nearby, which will make the commute to Manhattan faster.Developers are also paying attention. The Horizon Group is building a 63-unit condo at 264 Webster Avenue, in the Kensington area of Brooklyn, part of the district with the highest birthrate in the city. David Marom, the company\u2019s managing partner, said he was drawn to the area by the number of schools and family amenities nearby.In an unusual move, the project revised its plans to build 72 rental units in favor of fewer, larger condos, including several two- and three-bedroom apartments, on the strength of the family market, he said. Prices will start at $325,000 for a studio and $895,000 for a three-bedroom. The project is also expected to qualify for city tax abatements that builders in some more expensive neighborhoods can no longer claim. As a result, buyers could pay as little as $4.55 a month in taxes the first year.Low monthly costs were one of the reasons Sharlene Kemler, 35, bought a two-bedroom co-op in Kensington for $440,000 in 2016. She and her husband, Jordan, pay about $600 a month in maintenance in a recently updated building, whereas monthly fees in Park Slope, at their last home, could be hundreds more. Not to mention that they couldn\u2019t compete with buyers there.\u201cWe were getting outbid,\u201d said Ms. Kemler, a philanthropy consultant who works with charities. \u201cYou\u2019re competing with 10 other people, and some are coming in all-cash.\u201dThe best part about their new home, she said, is that their one-year-old son, Milo, will grow up with friends that have diverse backgrounds. The area has a mix of East Asian, Uzbeki, Russian and Hispanic residents, among others. Pricier Park Slope, Ms. Kemler said, can feel more homogeneous by comparison. The push toward more affordable neighborhoods, however, underscores a persistent housing problem: Incoming bargain hunters are raising the prices for longtime residents.Brownsville, in Brooklyn, for instance, was part of the district that had the fourth highest share of births in 2017, a large jump from 2012, when it came in 20th place. But it is also one of the poorest areas on the list. The median household income there last year was less than $20,300.\u201cIt\u2019s like gentrification refugees,\u201d said Gerard D. Miller Jr., a housing counselor with Brooklyn Neighborhood Services, a nonprofit group. \u201cEast New York is rapidly developing. Canarsie is up. Now Brownsville is the last-ditch effort for affordability.\u201dGaylene Durrant, 43, was getting priced out of her two-bedroom apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where she had lived for years with her two sons. Two years ago, she qualified for a below-market-rate apartment in a new complex in Brownsville.The five-building complex, called Prospect Plaza, was developed by Oceanhill LLC, in collaboration with the nonprofit NYC Housing Partnership and with funding from the city, and it was entirely reserved for residents making less than 60 percent of the New York area\u2019s median income. Two-bedrooms, for example, were designated for families making about $30,000 to $42,000 a year. More than 100,000 applications were submitted for 394 units, said Gale D. Kaufman, of Duvernay + Brooks, one of the developers. Ms. Durrant, who works in retail services, now pays about $900 a month, after additional subsidies, for a two-bedroom apartment in one of the buildings.She has since revisited her old apartment in Bed-Stuy, where the landlord did major work after she moved out and increased the rent significantly. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe how nice it is now,\u201d she said. It is not just the housing that has gotten more expensive in her old neighborhood, she said, but also the services: Her local grocery was recently renovated, and when it reopened the prices were noticeably higher.Sometimes she wonders where she would have gone if she had not entered the affordable housing lottery. \u201cIf push came to shove, I probably might have moved to Florida,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

We have the insider-trading guy in upstate New York and a California representative who allegedly used campaign contributions for, um, personal matters.Duncan Hunter, the California Republican, was charged with spending more than $250,000 in political donations on not-at-all-eligible priorities. At first we heard mention of things like dental work and plane fare for the family\u2019s pet rabbit.

He\u2019s accused of telling his son to sell 1.3 million shares in an Australian drug company after he received a private warning that its much-anticipated new drug had failed its tests.Collins and Hunter were the first two members of Congress to endorse Donald Trump for president.

It\u2019s a pretty impressive history for a guy who grew up poor, the son of a Mexican-American mother whose husband had left the family.That missing father was of Palestinian descent, and Campa-Najjar\u2019s paternal grandfather, who died before he was born, was part of the 1972 Munich massacre of Olympic athletes.We can either celebrate Campa-Najjar as an example of the American ability to move beyond the dead weight of your family\u2019s past, or jump right into the great swamp of terrorism-terrorizing.His opponent, Nate McMurray, hoped that Collins would eventually get desperate. \u201cAnd if he\u2019s down, he\u2019s going to throw that Hail Mary, and if he does that, we\u2019re going to intercept that ball, and we\u2019re going to run it back,\u201d said the Democrat. The district is near Buffalo, where sports metaphors are very popular.Collins, who seems to rely heavily on mentioning the name of Nancy Pelosi whenever possible, is still a slight favorite to win in a district that Donald Trump won by 25 points.

{"Headline": "For China, a Bridge Over the Adriatic Is a Road Into Europe", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKOMARNA, Croatia \u2014 As a quirk of history and the Balkan wars, a corner of Croatia is cut off from the rest of the country by a 12-mile interruption of land belonging to neighboring Bosnia. It is a rift that Croatia has long wanted to repair with a bridge that would unite the disconnected sliver of its coast with the rest of the country.For decades \u2014 foiled by war, corruption, political bickering and global financial turmoil \u2014 work never got much further on the bridge than abandoned concrete pylons and two bronze angels overlooking the glittering waters of the Adriatic Sea.That is, until the Chinese arrived this summer.With drills churning and its engineers arriving daily, a state-owned Chinese construction firm, the China Road and Bridge Corporation, is the latest company to take on the project.For many Croatians, just the possibility that the long-awaited bridge project is now on track to be completed is reason for celebration.But the project is also a test case for the European Union, which has been wary of allowing state-owned Chinese firms into the market for big European infrastructure projects, fearing that Chinese companies can undermine competition, trample the bloc\u2019s labor laws and depress wages.The bridge, which will span the water separating a peninsula in the disconnected region with the village of Komarna and the rest of Croatia, is the first time that a project funded largely with European Union money has been won by a Chinese firm.80 MILESSLOVENIAZagrebCROATIABOSNIA ANDHERZEGOVINADetail areaITALY10 milesKomarnaBosnia andHerzegovinaNeumCroatiaAdriatic SeaDubrovnikBy The New York TimesChina Road and Bridge won the contract with a proposal that undercut the nearest competitor by nearly $100 million, leading to a legal challenge. The European Commission is also investigating whether Croatia awarded the contract in line with European Union rules.On top of the concerns officials have over competitive practices and lower wages, many of the jobs that come with the project may not even go to workers in the slow-growing economies of Europe.Typically, Chinese state firms bring most of their own workers for construction projects, an often contentious practice. It is not clear if Croatian authorities even know how much the Chinese workers will be paid. China Road and Bridge did not respond to queries, and the Croatian authorities said they did not want to officially comment.\u201cEuropean companies are increasingly finding themselves in the situation that they cannot compete with Chinese-subsidized companies on price levels,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an economic analyst who has detailed Chinese investments and loans in the Balkans in a report for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.In a 2016 report, the European Union Institute for Security Studies concluded that the bloc may \u201chave to acknowledge its limited leverage when it comes to influencing Chinese corporate behavior.\u201dYet for Croatia, which joined the European Union in 2013, the project has become a neat and relatively cheap fix for a once insolvable problem in a Balkans region where bridges have long played outsize roles in politics and diplomacy.When rulers sought to unite the region\u2019s ethnic and religious groups, bridges were built across rivers and over valley passes. When leaders wanted to divide people along ethnic lines, those same bridges were often fought over or destroyed to keep communities apart.The gap in Croatia\u2019s territory occurred after the socialist Yugoslavia dissolved and frontiers between its former republics became international borders. The Neum corridor, the strip of Bosnia\u2019s coastline that cuts Croatia in two, is Bosnia\u2019s only access to the Adriatic Sea.As things stand, people traveling from Croatia\u2019s southern coast must endure four border checkpoints to reach the rest of the country, which can mean delays of hours that disrupt one of the nation\u2019s chief economic drivers, tourism.\u201cThis project genuinely embodies our commitment to removing barriers, uniting territories and bringing people together,\u201d Corina Cretu, the union\u2019s commissioner for regional policy, said at the time.Yet six months later, the situation became more complicated when Croatia awarded the project to China Road and Bridge. Rivals were furious. A Croatian court later dismissed a complaint from a losing bidder, the Austrian firm Strabag, which accused the Chinese consortium of charging a price that was lower than the actual value of the project.On a recent afternoon at the construction site, Jeroslav Segedin, a civil engineer, gave a tour of the early stages of the project. Mr. Segedin, a representative of Croatia Roads, which contracted with the Chinese company for the project, stressed the importance of the bridge, despite the concerns about Beijing\u2019s involvement.\u201cIt means a lot to both Croatia and this region,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a national symbol for Croatia.\u201dMr. Segedin, whose team of civil engineers will oversee the project, said construction should reach its peak in about 18 months, when there are expected to be 490 workers on the bridge, most of them Chinese living in trailers on the sparsely populated peninsula. Croatian workers will take part in the construction, but only on a small scale.The uncertainty around how many Chinese workers will be employed at the site, and what they will be paid, has spawned rumors.\u201cIt\u2019s incredible, the calls I\u2019ve been getting regarding the Chinese workers in our region,\u201d said Smiljan Mustapic, the governor of the Slivno area where the bridge is being built. \u201cIt\u2019s like a group of aliens has landed.\u201dFor now, the bridge construction is focused under water and requires only a few dozen Chinese engineers.The ostensible reason for the joint patrols was to help resolve issues related to Chinese tourists. But it also served as a dry run for Croatia\u2019s plans to host a meeting of the Chinese-led investment initiative, known as 16+1, in Dubrovnik next year. It includes 11 European Union members in Central and Eastern Europe along with five Balkan nations.Mr. Mustapic, the governor of the area where the bridge is being built, said, \u201cFor us, the construction of this bridge is priceless.\u201dHe could not help but be overcome, he said, as he saw the lights on the water that marked the start of the work on the bridge\u2019s foundation.\u201cIt meant that this time, it is going to happen,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Is the Migrant Caravan and Why Does Trump Care?", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA caravan of migrants, nearly all of them Hondurans, is making its way north through Guatemala toward Mexico and the United States. It is the latest, and certainly the largest, iteration of a phenomenon that has occurred from time to time: big groups of Central Americans joining together to face the challenges of migration, their numbers providing security against the criminals that stalk the route north.But this one has drawn the ire of President Trump, who warned on Thursday that he would shut down the southwest border of the United States if Mexico did not halt the group. He also reiterated his threat that unless the governments of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador stopped the caravan\u2019s progress, he would suspend foreign aid to them.\u201cI must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught \u2014\u201d he posted on Twitter, \u201cand if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!\u201dAnd for good measure, perhaps with the midterm elections in mind, he took a shot at the Democratic Party, blaming it in part for the caravan of migrants.\u201cHopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their Northern Border,\u201d he wrote in another of a series of Twitter posts. \u201cAll Democrats fault for weak laws!\u201dHere are answers to some questions about the migrant caravan that has upset Mr. Trump this week and inflamed political concerns throughout the region.The migrant caravan was formed late last week in San Pedro Sula, a city in northern Honduras known for high levels of violence. It originally numbered fewer than 200 people \u2014 in line with most past caravans. But as word spread, the mobilization quickly grew. By the time the group had crossed the border into Guatemala, its members traveling by foot and vehicle, it had ballooned to more than 1,000.More migrants have joined this week \u2014 by some estimates it now numbers an extraordinary 4,000 people \u2014 though it has fractured into smaller groups that were making their way at varying speeds through Guatemala on Thursday.Like the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have fled Central America in recent years, most of the caravan\u2019s participants have in mind a new life in the United States, though some say they intend to stop in Mexico. Many say they have been ground down by low wages, unemployment and poor public services in Honduras and are looking for better opportunities elsewhere. Others say they fear for their lives and intend to apply for asylum either in Mexico or the United States.Advocacy groups, in the past, have used the caravans to draw attention to the migrants\u2019 plight and the state of affairs in their homelands. But no group has claimed responsibility for organizing this week\u2019s caravan.During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s fierce attacks against immigrants were wildly successful in firing up his conservative base. And with midterm elections only weeks away, he has renewed these attacks, warning of criminals pouring over the border to threaten American citizens and suggesting that undocumented immigrants will cause economic dislocation and job loss.He has been using those themes at every campaign rally, which have increased significantly in the last few weeks. And many Republican candidates have embraced his anti-immigrant message in their own races.In his caravan-inspired Twitter storm on Thursday morning, the president wrote: \u201cI am watching the Democrat Party led (because they want Open Borders and existing weak laws) assault on our country by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people, INCLUDING MANY CRIMINALS, from entering Mexico to U.S.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s initial salvos in his response to the caravan this week were directed at the Honduran government, but were quickly expanded to include El Salvador and Guatemala. He threatened all three countries with a suspension of foreign aid should they allow their citizens to continue traveling toward the United States with the intention of entering illegally. Central America has been a primary source of undocumented migration to the United States in recent years.With the caravan having already crossed into Guatemala, there was little the Honduran government could do to arrest its progress, though the administration of President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez of Honduras deployed security forces to a main border crossing to try to prevent others from joining the migration. The Honduran government also urged citizens not to join the caravan, calling it a political mobilization aimed against the president.Meanwhile, the Guatemalan government detained a former Honduran lawmaker who was traveling with the caravan, accusing him of failing to comply with immigration rules.President Jimmy Morales of Guatemala dismissed Mr. Trump\u2019s threats, telling reporters that he rejected constraints placed on foreign aid. He also said he had spoken with his Honduran counterpart, President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez, about guaranteeing the safe return of migrants who decide they want to return home, Reuters reported.In Mexico, the government deployed about 700 National Police officers to the southern border and issued statements warning the caravan\u2019s participants against trying to enter the country illegally.By Thursday afternoon, some participants had already crossed illegally into Mexico on rafts that ply the river and had settled in temporary shelters run by the local municipality, Ciudad Hidalgo. But hundreds of others remained on the Guatemalan side of the border to await the arrival of the rest of the caravan.The Mexican immigration authorities have said that migrants with valid documents and visas will be allowed in, but that those who attempt to enter illegally will be detained and deported. Those seeking asylum or some other forms of protection can request it, but will have to wait in a detention center for as many as 45 days, officials said.Secretary of State Michael Pompeo traveled to Panama City on Thursday to meet with President Juan Carlos Varela. He plans then to head to Mexico, where he is scheduled to meet on Friday with President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, among other officials. Migration, and the caravan, will surely be among the top issues on the agenda in Mexico City.Maya Averbuch contributed reporting from Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Children\u2019s Allowances in a New Form: Debit Cards Linked to Parents\u2019 Phones", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserNo need to worry about coming up with cash for a child\u2019s allowance. Parents can now choose from a rapidly expanding menu of prepaid debit cards, aimed at giving them digital oversight of their children\u2019s spending and saving habits.\u201cPrepaid has really evolved,\u201d said Christina Tetreault, a staff attorney with the financial services program at Consumers Union.The latest offerings include cards with slick companion apps from financial start-ups like Greenlight, Current and goHenry. Unlike traditional debit cards, which are directly attached to checking accounts, all must be loaded with money by parents.The digital tools aim to fix an increasingly common problem: Parents don\u2019t always have cash on hand. So they can be caught short when a child needs money for an outing with friends, to put gas in the car or to complete a chore. With an app, parents can put money on a child\u2019s debit card with a few taps on their phone.Details vary by card, but typically parents sign up for the account, then link their checking account or debit card as a way to fund the child\u2019s card. Parents can give cards to multiple offspring, even those of tender age. (GoHenry recommends its card for children as young as 6.)Parents can use the apps to establish allowance transfers, set spending limits, or offer payment for chores and a dizzying array of other tasks. Parents can get text or email messages when their child makes a purchase. And parents can quickly tap the app to disable the card if the child loses it.Financial advocates say that beyond all the bells and whistles, the main benefit of the \u201csmart\u201d prepaid cards is that they can prompt parents to talk with their children about money.\u201cThese cards are a great tool to learn about money management, if they\u2019re used right,\u201d said Will deHoo, founder and executive director of the FoolProof Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes \u201chealthy skepticism\u201d about financial products.That means emphasizing budgeting and saving, not just spending \u2014 which, after all, is a debit card\u2019s main function. \u201cA debit card never met a sale it didn\u2019t like,\u201d Mr. deHoo said.Promoters say the cards do encourage saving. Greenlight lets parents automatically match money the child sets aside in a savings account. Rates on bank savings accounts are still low \u2014 2 percent is considered generous \u2014 making compound interest a hard sell. But parents can direct the app to pay the child their own, personal interest rates \u2014 say, 20 percent or even 100 percent \u2014 as an incentive. (The card account itself doesn\u2019t pay any interest.)Greenlight also allows parents to supervise spending by choosing the type of stores or restaurants where children can shop. Money on the card is put into two categories: for spending anywhere, or for only preapproved stores and websites. If the child tries to buy something at a nonapproved store \u2014 or tries to spend more money than is available on the card \u2014 the purchase is declined.Children with mobile phones can get their own version of the app, which lets them check balances or seek a parent\u2019s permission to buy a specific item.Greenlight, with financial backers that include Amazon and two big banks, became available in 2017 and now has about 200,000 paying customers, said Tim Sheehan, the company\u2019s chief executive. Next week, the card will add new features, including the ability to use the card at A.T.M.s.Current, backed by investors including an arm of Fifth Third Bank, lets parents offer their children the option to earn money by doing chores. One example: \u201cMow Lawn. $10.\u201d Once the chore is done, funds are transferred. Stuart Sopp, Current\u2019s founder and chief executive, said his 9-year-old daughter had a card and often told him, \u201cI want more chores.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a parental toolbox,\u201d he said.The idea is to let children make spending mistakes, with guardrails to prevent disasters, Mr. Dwight said. \u201cIf you nag the kid about every transaction,\u201d he said, the child may tune you out.Here are some questions and answers about debit cards for children:Do prepaid cards for children charge fees?Yes. Most of the new cards charge a monthly or annual fee. They typically don\u2019t charge extra fees for adding money onto the card, but it\u2019s always wise to check the fee schedule before enrolling.Is money on the prepaid cards protected by federal deposit insurance?Most financial start-ups team up with federally insured banks that issue the debit cards. So the funds are typically held in a way that qualifies for insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, up to the $250,000 limit. Ms. Tetreault, the Consumers Union lawyer, said it\u2019s always wise to check a card\u2019s user agreement and disclosures to check whether funds are insured.What other options are available if I want digital oversight of my child\u2019s money?Some banks, like Capital One and USAA, offer traditional checking accounts for teenagers that are managed jointly with parents, online or via an app. Patricia Seaman, a spokeswoman for the National Endowment for Financial Education, suggests that parents double check to make sure any bank account they open for a child does not allow overdrafts, to avoid possible fees.Advertisement"}

He curated some of the museum\u2019s biggest exhibitions of Asian art.Wen C. Fong, a renowned scholar who helped the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York build one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive collections of Asian art, died on Oct. 3 in Princeton, N.J. He was 88.His wife, Constance Tang Fong, said the cause was leukemia.A leading figure in the history of Chinese art, Professor Fong taught for 40 years at Princeton University, where in the 1950s he established the nation\u2019s first doctoral degree program in Chinese art and archaeology.Beginning in the early 1970s he was a driving force behind the Met\u2019s ambitious effort to expand its collection of Asian art, including masterworks from China, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia and India, and add space in which to display it.An immigrant who came to the United States at age 18, on the eve of the Communist takeover in China, Professor Fong earned a Ph.D at Princeton and then gained a reputation for being an empire builder, first at the Princeton University Art Museum and then at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Mr. Fong, left, toured a gallery of Japanese art at the Metropolitan Museum in 1987 with C. Douglas Dillon, the Wall Street financier and former Treasury secretary who was a longtime trustee and benefactor of the museum.He also wrote, edited or contributed to more than a dozen books about Chinese art, including his seminal work, \u201cBeyond Representation: Chinese Painting and Calligraphy 8th-14th Century,\u201d which was jointly published by the Met and Yale University Press.Wen Fong was born in 1930 in Shanghai. His father owned a dry goods store. Wen took to art as a boy, even as chaos enveloped his city during the Japanese occupation in World War II and the civil war that brought the Communists to power.Tutored at home, he was given a classical Chinese education, at one time by the well-known calligrapher and scholar Li Jian. By age 10 he was giving public exhibitions of his calligraphy.Resisting his parents\u2019 wish that he study science, he decided to pursue his interest in art by leaving for the United States to study at Princeton. There he earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in medieval European art history and a Ph.D in art history, with a focus on ancient China.At Princeton, Professor Fong educated generations of students in connoisseurship, teaching them how to examine objects closely. To him, that meant not paging through old books and viewing slides or photographs but encountering the actual works of art, getting a feel for their texture, contours and brush strokes, and then contemplating their meaning and power.Professor Fong and a colleague, Frederick W. Mote, set up the nation\u2019s first doctoral program in Chinese art and archaeology at Princeton in 1959.To deepen his own appreciation of art, Professor Fong was a faculty curator at the Princeton University Art Museum in the 1960s, which he described as a \u201claboratory\u201d for his study of ancient forms. He organized special exhibitions and helped the museum strengthen its holdings of photography and Asian art. Among its major acquisitions during that time was the John B. Elliott Collection of Chinese Calligraphy, widely considered one of the finest collections of ancient calligraphy outside of Asia.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Then, in 1971, on the eve of President Richard M. Nixon\u2019s opening to China, the Metropolitan Museum of Art asked Professor Fong to help revamp and upgrade its Asian art collection. At the time, the Met\u2019s Asian holdings were narrow and hardly notable, consisting mainly of jade, a few prized ceramics, and Buddhist sculptures and Japanese prints.Over the next 30 years, as a special consultant to the Met, Professor Fong helped build one of the most comprehensive collections of Asian art and antiquities in the world.A man of boundless energy, he hired new Asian specialists at the Met, including Mr. Hearn; he tutored the Met\u2019s board on landmark pieces from Chinese history that might be acquired; and he negotiated with collectors on loaning, donating or selling their works to the museum.By the time Professor Fong retired from the Met, in 2000, his imprint was on everything from conservation and the planning of exhibitions, to the more than 50 permanent galleries that are now devoted to displaying Asian art.In addition to his wife, Professor Fong is survived by three children, Laurence, Peter and Serena; and two grandchildren.An earlier version of this obituary misstated the date of Professor Fong\u2019s death. It was Oct. 3, not Oct. 1. The earlier version also misstated the year Professor Fong retired from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was 2000, not 1999.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Republicans Hold Cash Edge Heading Into Final Stretch of the Midterms", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Republicans entered the final month of the campaign with more money in the bank than the Democrats, providing them with vital ammunition as they wage a furious effort to hold on to control of Congress.The most recent round of campaign finance disclosures, filed Saturday, showed that Republican national party committees, candidates in key House and Senate races and their top unlimited-money outside groups, or \u201csuper PACs,\u201d had $337 million on hand as of Sept. 30. Their Democratic counterparts had $285 million in the bank on the same date.By contrast, Republicans owe their cash-on-hand advantage to brisk major-donor fund-raising, and a slower pace of spending, by their party committees and super PACs.The three national Republican Party committees had outraised their Democratic counterparts $531 million to $471 million since the beginning of 2017, according to the disclosures with the Federal Election Commission.Super PAC fund-raising was basically a draw, with the top 10 Democratic super PACs outraising their Republican counterparts $335.3 million to $335.1 million \u2014 washing away concern among Democrats that they could be swamped by a late tidal wave of cash from wealthy Republicans.Overall, Democrats have outraised Republicans $1.29 billion to $1.23 billion, counting their respective top super PACs, national party committees and campaigns in targeted congressional races, according to an analysis of election commission filings covering the beginning of 2017 through the end of last month.The analysis does not capture all of the money at play in the final weeks, including spending by nonprofit groups that do not disclose their donors, as well as seven- and even eight-figure donations that major donors or their advisers say have been \u2014 or are expected to be \u2014 given to super PACs after the period reflected in Saturday\u2019s filings.It also does not necessarily mean that the committees with the largest nest eggs \u2014 such as the Republican National Committee, which has $51.3 million in the bank, compared to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s $10.3 million \u2014 will necessarily spend their cash in the midterms directly.The Republican cash advantage could allow the party to bolster financially strapped campaigns that still have a chance, and fund an emerging strategy of nationalizing the race around President Trump and culturally divisive issues like immigration and the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. Republicans are issuing ominous warnings about liberal \u201cmobs\u201d deploying dirty tactics to help Democrats smear conservatives and push the country toward socialism.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing parity in the money race, and I expect both sides to be taking a pretty hard look at their races in the next week or two, so that they can cut some, and double or triple up on others,\u201d said Michael J. Malbin, the executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that analyzes campaign fund-raising and spending.The bigger strategic issue for candidates, party committees and super PACs, he suggested, will be how they adjust to Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to nationalize the midterm elections in a manner that defies recent political norms.\u201cPresident Trump in the last two weeks has managed to dominate free media coverage in a way that is firing up his base, and the value of that cannot be measured in the same way you measure super PAC advertising or party committee spending,\u201d he said.The two super PACs have combined to raise tens of millions of dollars this year, according to election commission filings, with big checks coming from labor unions and wealthy liberals, including a total of $2.5 million from Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor.His political adviser, Howard Wolfson, said: \u201cBig money has traditionally sided with Republicans. But in this cycle you\u2019ve seen some change with at least a couple of Democratic donors who are attempting to level the playing field a little bit, and we would certainly be prominent in that group.\u201dBrian Baker, the president of a super PAC called Future45 and a political adviser to the Ricketts family, major donors to Republican and conservative causes, said that \u201cit\u2019s difficult to compete with the Democrats\u2019 funding, but we are trying to help level the playing field so that their message isn\u2019t the only one voters hear.\u201dIts ad asserts that \u201cvoting for any Democrat\u201d will empower \u201cthe far left moving to socialism, undefended open borders, immediate tax increases, 100 percent government-run health care,\u201d as well as \u201cthe screaming, the violence, the smears and death threats\u201d of angry mobs.\u201cMost strategists will say that if you\u2019re the party in power in a midterm, you should localize,\u201d Mr. Baker acknowledged. \u201cBut this is already a national election, and rather than walking away from that, we are embracing it and trying to expose the extreme elements of the Democratic Party, and what they\u2019d do if they win the majority.\u201dAt least some major Republican donors appear to be on board with the themes that Mr. Trump and supportive super PACs are using to try to nationalize the race.\u201cThese attacks on free enterprise, and the idea that we want to go to socialism, which has failed throughout history, is scary to me,\u201d said Frank VanderSloot, who owns an Idaho-based health and home products company called Melaleuca. The company has donated $500,000 to Congressional Leadership Fund, while Mr. VanderSloot and his family have donated another $285,000 to Republican candidates and committees.\u201cWhat\u2019s driving me is to try to protect America as we know it,\u201d Mr. VanderSloot said. He said he does not always like Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric and \u201chis attacking of individuals.\u201d But he said he supports the president\u2019s deregulation and tax-cutting measures, adding that he gave $2 million worth of bonuses to his employees after the tax cuts.\u201cThe overall climate for business I think is greatly improved,\u201d he said. \u201cOur sales are way up.

{"Headline": "The Future of Electric Cars Is Brighter With Elon Musk in It", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "OpinionFederal regulators were right to rein in his reckless management, but the company and the global auto industry need him.Supported byMr. MacDuffie is director of the Program on Vehicle and Mobility Innovation at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania.His leadership matters well beyond Silicon Valley. Tesla, under Mr. Musk, has been the single most significant force driving the global automotive industry \u2014 and the consumers who purchase cars \u2014 to take the prospect of a fully electric vehicle future seriously. No other electric vehicle initiative \u2014 from Nissan\u2019s Leaf and GM\u2019s Chevrolet Volt and Bolt to the new wave of luxury electric cars being rolled out by German automakers and new companies funded by Chinese billionaires \u2014 has achieved the impact on the public\u2019s imagination, brand loyalty or sales success of Tesla. Those initiatives might not even have occurred without the prod of Tesla\u2019s example. Aside from his vision for electric vehicles, Tesla under Mr. Musk has accomplished a remarkable feat: the creation of a new automaker. In the modern era, nearly all new entrants have started in developing countries, at the low end; most new automakers founded in the United States and Europe have failed. Tesla\u2019s approach is not what most expected from a Silicon Valley disrupter. Unlike Apple\u2019s iPhone \u2014 \u201cdesigned by Apple in California, assembled in China\u201d \u2014 nearly all of Tesla\u2019s value chain from product conception through delivery to customers is carried out by the company itself. Tesla\u2019s travails in mastering high-volume production of a mass-market product, the Model 3, are well known, and it may never attain Toyota-like levels of efficiency. But if Tesla can persevere, it could achieve the elusive high-volume, mass-market electric vehicle that would be a tipping point for the future of the industry.Tesla under Mr. Musk has also established a template for what the \u201cmobility\u201d firms of the future must do. Chief among these is the ability to update vehicle functionality via over-the-air software updates; the addition of algorithm-driven features that offer partially autonomous operation along with the collection of data to improve those algorithms; connectivity with the consumer to provide services; and the ability for a customer to configure and purchase a vehicle online. Tesla under new leadership, or as a unit of a much larger company, might be able to maintain what Mr. Musk has achieved. But Tesla\u2019s survival thus far has been a tightrope act, and falling off is virtually guaranteed without Mr. Musk. He has proved uniquely and idiosyncratically able to sustain the loyalty and fervent belief of investors, customers and employees. While Tesla has benefited from public subsidies such as consumer tax credits, federal grants, and the sale of zero emission credits to other automakers, Mr. Musk\u2019s ability as a salesman is apparent in his success at raising private funds and sustaining high valuations. Even Tesla\u2019s luck in buying its factory in Fremont, Calif., at a bargain-basement price from Toyota is attributable to Mr. Musk\u2019s ability to charm Toyota\u2019s chief executive. Tesla owners also seem to identify closely with Mr. Musk. For the Model 3, they had to put down a $1,000 deposit, and most have been waiting months for their new cars. This willingness to commit to a purchase before the vehicle is even available for viewing has enormous value. It means Tesla spends almost no money on marketing, and it knows before building each vehicle who the customer will be and how he wants it configured. No other auto manufacturer enjoys this type of prerelease enthusiasm \u2014 and it is Mr. Musk who single-handedly sustains it. Were Tesla to become the electric car division of an existing automaker, even if its products stay strong, this pattern of advance demand commitments would be unlikely to continue.To be sure, Mr. Musk needs help as a manager. Steve Jobs eventually found Tim Cook; Mark Zuckerberg found Sheryl Sandberg. Mr. Musk has already found a strong managerial partner, Gwynne Shotwell, for SpaceX. He has pointed to his elevation of Jerome Guillen, a seasoned auto industry executive, to president of automotive as a similar move for Tesla. Mr. Guillen has not yet stepped forward in a prominent way as co-leader, but the S.E.C.\u2019s action, along with a much stronger board of directors, could nudge Mr. Musk toward expanding Mr. Guillen\u2019s influence.

{"Headline": "Liberal Hypocrisy in College Admissions?", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe legacy system is affirmative action for the privileged.Opinion ColumnistWe progressives hail opportunity, egalitarianism and diversity. Yet here\u2019s our dirty little secret: Some of our most liberal bastions in America rely on a system of inherited privilege that benefits rich whites at the expense of almost everyone else.I\u2019m talking about \u201clegacy preferences\u201d that elite universities give to children of graduates. These universities constitute some of the world\u2019s greatest public goods, but they rig admissions to favor applicants who already have had every privilege in life.\u201cIt\u2019s a hereditary principle at work in an area that should be meritocratic,\u201d observed Richard Reeves of the Brookings Institution, who criticized legacy preferences in his book \u201cDream Hoarders.\u201d Reeves noted the irony that in Europe and most of the rest of the world, there is no such explicit system of legacy preferences, yet in supposedly egalitarian America it is formal and systematic.Isn\u2019t it a bit hypocritical that institutions so associated with liberalism should embrace a hereditary aristocratic structure? Ah, never underestimate the power of self-interest to shape people\u2019s views. As Reeves put it dryly: \u201cAmerican liberalism tends to diminish as the issues get closer to home.\u201dI write this as a beneficiary of affirmative action. I was an Oregon farm boy, and Ivy League schools wanted the occasional country bumpkin, so I milked this for all it was worth by writing a college essay about me vaccinating sheep, picking strawberries and competing in the Future Farmers of America. Harvard wanted hicks from the sticks, so it chose me to help diversify its freshman class \u2014 and then Harvard had a huge impact on me. I\u2019m also proud to have served some years ago on Harvard\u2019s board and to have been a visiting fellow at its Kennedy School of Government.The top universities say that legacy preferences help create a multigenerational community of alumni, and that\u2019s a legitimate argument. They also note that rewarding donors helps encourage donations that can be used to finance scholarships for needy kids.Yet on balance, I\u2019m troubled that some of America\u2019s greatest institutions grant a transformative opportunity disproportionately to kids already steeped in advantage, from violin lessons to chess tournaments to SAT coaching. On top of that, letting wealthy families pay for extra consideration feels, to use a technical term, yucky.Liberals object to the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision allowing tycoons to buy political influence, so why allow tycoons to buy influence in college admissions?More broadly, what happened to equal opportunity and meritocracy? They may be ideals rather than reality, but why defend a formal structure of hereditary privilege and monetary advantage in accessing top universities?\u201cLegacy preferences give a leg up to applicants who have typically led privileged lives,\u201d said Susan Dynarski, a (Harvard-trained) professor of economics, education and public policy at the University of Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s the polar opposite of affirmative action, which boosts applicants who have faced adversity. It\u2019s unconscionable for a handful of elite colleges to amass enormous tax-advantaged endowments and use them to perpetuate privilege in this way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "65 or Older? Here\u2019s What We Owe Our Kids", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI\u2019m a baby boomer. Our parents spoiled us by building a better world than they had. Somewhere down the road, we stopped promising our own children the same. Mr. Kramon teaches business students in their mid- or late 20s, his daughter\u2019s age.STANFORD, Calif. \u2014 I\u2019m a 65-year-old member of the Me Generation. I\u2019m writing to people my age and older about the iGeneration \u2014 those under 25, often called Generation Z. Many of them worry about their futures and could use help. If we\u2019re to avoid living down to our self-centered nickname, our post-65 narrative must change.A half-century ago, many of us grew up expecting to work hard and quit at 65, or sooner. With decent pensions and government benefits, we would live on the golf course or the beach for 10, maybe 20 years.Many of us are retiring before 65 or not returning to work after our children leave. But now many of us will live into our late 80s and 90s. Since we were as young as the iGen is now, average life expectancy in America has risen more than five years, and higher for the most affluent. One reason is Medicare, covering Americans over 65 or disabled.Now that doctors keep us alive longer, we\u2019re costing far more than our parents and grandparents did. Annual health spending \u2014 $2,200 per American in 1970 when we were their age \u2014 almost quintupled to more than $10,000 in 2016, after inflation, according to the National Health Expenditure Accounts.What should bother the iGen is that 50 years ago this money might have gone to improving schools or roads or safety, or to fighting climate change.I even wonder whether increased Medicare spending is partly responsible for the election of Donald Trump, whose margin of victory came from voters in our generation. Without that spending, might enough of us have died sooner and tipped the balance in favor of Hillary Clinton? My generation will say we paid into the system for decades and deserve our entitlements. But the one-earner baby boomer couple my age who have earned the average wage every year have paid less than $100,000 in Medicare taxes but are taking out benefits worth more than $400,000, after adjusting for inflation, according to C. Eugene Steuerle, a former Treasury official now at the Urban Institute.He also found that the couple will receive half a million dollars in Social Security after paying in little more than a quarter million.What should we older folks do?First, those who remain healthy must stay productive \u2014 preferably in ways that help young people. In my case, I created a teaching job that pays me health insurance, so that even as I still contribute to Medicare, I don\u2019t draw benefits.Some of us can\u2019t work full time. But we \u2014 especially the comfortable, like many my age here in Silicon Valley \u2014 could volunteer in programs that benefit children. One woman I know began coaching students, many from immigrant families, on their writing. A college classmate is overseeing and financing the San Francisco high school that educated him and that now teaches low-income students. Another classmate is reviving an athletic competition for Los Angeles children.Second, those of us with savings can donate to causes that benefit the young, including through our wills. Baby boomers sit on many trillions in assets. By diverting some to such causes, we could have a big effect. Two of my former business students have created a company, Freewill, that encourages us to create wills and leave money to worthy causes. A 69-year-old retired businessman in Houston left 20 percent of his $2 million estate to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. By contrast, many baby boomers, even affluent ones, have no will, and only about 5 percent leave money to charity, Freewill reports.Two other students are creating a business that matches volunteers with people who pay for services with a contribution to charity. We could volunteer, or we could hire those volunteers. Yet another former student has created a kind of Common App for scholarships, making it far easier for youths to apply and much simpler for donors to create them.Third, we can create a living will and make clear we don\u2019t want expensive medical care when it won\u2019t make a difference.At Stanford\u2019s commencement last June, the actor Sterling K. Brown, halfway between\u200b our generations, laid out for the iGen a mission that should be the Me Gen\u2019s too. \u201cMy mama always told me, \u2018When you visit someone else\u2019s house, leave things better than the way you found them,\u2019\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201c\u2018That way, you\u2019ll always be asked back.\u2019\u2019\u2019The singer Sheena Easton might describe our mission another way: less takin\u2019 and more givin\u2019.Talking with hundreds of students has brought home how worried our children and grandchildren are about climate change, inequality and the shrinking role of government in helping needy people.I tell them about the political system in which we in the Me Generation grew up. In the mid-1960s, Republicans and Democrats of my parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 generations created Medicare, Medicaid, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, immigration reform, education reform, the Highway Safety Act, the Wilderness Act, cleaner air and water, public broadcasting and much more.Our generation has failed at anything close to that. But such magic is possible. Remind your children and grandchildren of that. Tell them it starts with voting, for candidates who will represent their interests. Urge them to make it happen. And help them.Glenn Kramon, a former assistant managing editor at The New York Times, is a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Damaging Bid to Censor Applications at Harvard", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf a lawsuit over affirmative action is successful, would-be college students may have to hide their race. Imagine this scenario: An admissions officer sits down to read a stack of applications, but they\u2019re heavily redacted because the college must censor all references to an applicant\u2019s race.The admissions officer can consider an applicant\u2019s gender, where she grew up, whether she preferred the Yankees to the Red Sox and every other conceivable part of her background or identity. But not her race, even if it had a formative impact on her life.Under Harvard\u2019s current admissions process, they could discuss the role race played in their lives. A white applicant might also want to share her experiences with race. But in the plaintiffs\u2019 alternate universe, it would be illegal for an admissions committee to take that into account. Others who oppose considerations of race in admissions claim that discussions of identity divide us as a country and that we all would be better off under a colorblind system.Colorblindness, therefore, forces race underground. It turns people of color into tokens and entrenches whiteness as the default. How would you feel if you were told you could not talk about your gender, your religion or your sexual orientation, that you could not discuss your disability or speak your own language? Silencing discussions about race silences people whose lives have been shaped by race.The same is true for Asian-Americans, who are a very diverse group. The irony of the Harvard case is that they would be disadvantaged by compulsory colorblindness because it would stifle more nuanced discussions about intraracial differences in culture and access to opportunity that may have molded their individual experiences.We need to stop pretending that affirmative action is the source of our problems around race. Ignoring race denies all of us chances to build bridges across communities and to understand the lived realities of race in America. Race matters. Not because it should, but because it does. As a leader in higher education, Harvard is trying to change this through its modest consideration of race in admissions. Its goal is to create a diverse community of students who can engage with and learn from people who are different, and carry those experiences with them beyond the university.Expressions of racial identity are part of the fullness of our humanity. It\u2019s not possible to be blind to race. Pretending as though it is ensures we will forever be divided.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Transformational Bliss of Borrowing Your Office Clothes", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "Rent the Runway\u2019s Unlimited service saves working women something more valuable than money: their time.Supported byOn a Friday morning in August, Sushma Dwivedi, a senior vice president at Edelman, the global marketing conglomerate, bustled around her Harlem apartment in a blue-and-white-striped cotton dress. With her toddler and newborn out with a nanny, Ms. Dwivedi, who was on maternity leave but preparing for a meeting with a senior colleague in a few days, intended to get some things done. High on her list: assessing the contents of a recently delivered dark-blue garment bag.Ms. Dwivedi, 37, is a member of Rent the Runway Unlimited, a service that, for $159 a month, allows subscribers to borrow up to four pieces of clothing and accessories from a designer-laden library of more than 450,000 items and keep them for as long as they want. If subscribers can\u2019t bear to part with something, they can buy it, generally for about half the retail price. (A cocoon-like wool cardigan from Jil Sander Navy sells in stores for $1,275, but costs $765 through Rent the Runway.) When members buy an item, or return it, via a prepaid shipping label in their garment bag, a spot for something new opens up.Though Rent the Runway was originally conceived as a solution for women who didn\u2019t want to invest in party-wear they might use only once, Unlimited has become a strategic solution for professional women such as Ms. Dwivedi, who manages 30 employees in Edelman\u2019s food and beverage department and regularly gets called into the offices of clients like Pepsi and Chobani.\u201cThe wardrobe thing, when I was trying to lose the baby weight, was frustrating,\u201d said Ms. Dwivedi, recalling her first pregnancy. \u201cI knew what I could buy when I was pregnant. I knew how big I was, but afterward, what was I going to do? Buy an entire wardrobe at five pounds thinner, five more pounds thinner, and on and on?\u201d She added, \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to look frumpy or have someone turn around and say, \u2018Wow, she looked a lot better before.\u2019\u201dSince Rent the Runway introduced Unlimited two years ago, the service has amassed tens of thousands of subscribers in part by promising to solve the problem of what to wear to work, for everyone from new hires to C-suite executives. (The company declined to confirm its user numbers, but analysts said that perhaps 50,000 people are active subscribers.) It is fast displacing the start-up\u2019s original business model. Rent the Runway was founded in 2009 as a way for people to borrow couture on an item-by-item basis. This year, Unlimited, which also has an $89-a-month tier, will account for the majority of revenue.\u201cI just have too much stuff: stuff that I bought, that I don\u2019t like anymore, that I don\u2019t wear anymore,\u201d said Kristin Lemkau, the chief marketing officer of JPMorgan Chase and a self-described Unlimited \u201csuperfan\u201d of two years. On a recent Wednesday morning at her office, on the 36th floor of a glossy Park Avenue monolith, she wore a flouncy, frilly black dress sprayed with pastel-colored daisies. Lemkau, 51, who helps oversee a $5 billion budget, routinely speaks at conferences on her firm\u2019s behalf, sometimes in places like the South of France or the Swiss Alps, which come with their own, rarefied dress codes.Before signing up for Unlimited, she regularly met with a wardrobe consultant near her Rye, N.Y., home. \u201cI\u2019d go to her house and pick out stuff,\u201d Ms. Lemkau said. \u201cI was never thrilled with the clothes. It was the same old black dress and black pants, and I started looking like I was in mourning all the time.\u201dShe ruffled her daisy-printed hem. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve bought this, but it\u2019s super cute, it\u2019s fun. I look forward to getting dressed every day instead of, \u2018What thing am I going to wear? Is my dry cleaning back?\u2019 I don\u2019t remember looking forward to getting dressed, ever.\u201dUnlimited frees mental space for women to think about more important matters: what to say in that big meeting; how to describe their employment history in a crucial job interview; how to, in the grand scheme of their professional lives, get ahead. \u201cWomen spend more time, more energy, more, just, time being distracted with shopping and thinking about the way they look compared to men,\u201d Ms. Lemkau said. \u201cEven at work, men were basically just deciding what tie to wear, and now, for the most part, they don\u2019t even wear ties. Is this service another way to potentially level the playing field?\u201dBefore joining Unlimited in 2016, Ms. Dwivedi spent untold hours rifling through fast-fashion stores like H&M and Zara, searching for a trendy blazer or statement necklace to liven up her work wardrobe. These days, she typically \u201cshops\u201d on Rent the Runway\u2019s iPhone app, scrolling through silk blouses and floral dresses as if they were Spotify songs, assessing member-submitted photos of the clothes out in the real world.\u201cI\u2019m having drinks with my mentor on Wednesday. I wasn\u2019t sure what to wear to that, so I gave myself a couple of options. If this is as flattering as I think it could be, I\u2019ll probably wear this,\u201d Ms. Dwivedi said, holding up a striped, sleeveless linen shift dress in a clear plastic sheathe. \u201cAnd if not, this maxi\u201d \u2014 a floor length, flowy black dress emblazoned with tropical blossoms.This is the trade-off. While Ms. Dwivedi luxuriates in the designer clothing that does fit \u2014 she received a steady stream of compliments from co-workers on a pink, plaid Trina Turk coat that she wore while pregnant with her first child \u2014 the stuff that does not must be sent back to the warehouse before she can order something new. The process generally takes a day or two.The Rent the Runway app and website regularly prompt users to review what they borrowed, and with a few taps, Ms. Dwivedi could report that the dress was not true to size. Despite the inconvenience of waiting for another shipment, she prefers this process to trying on outfits in a store. \u201cI would rather have the shaming of it all and the judging experience on my own,\u201d she said.\u201cOver 50 percent of our customers provide data back to us after they rent, every single time,\u201d said Jenn Hyman, 38, who is Rent the Runway\u2019s chief executive and co-founder. \u201cWithout an incentive, our customers want to make this service better for other women, and they\u2019re telling us because they want us to fix the problem.\u201d She was standing in the company\u2019s 250,000-square-foot warehouse in Secaucus, N.J. \u2014 a structure it says is the largest dry-cleaning facility in the world. Rent the Runway calls it the Dream Fulfillment Center.It is garment-tracking infrastructure of staggering proportions. Unlike companies that have democratized access to movies (Netflix) or music (Spotify), Rent the Runway peddles in touchable, feel-able, not-streamable material goods \u2014 garments that lose buttons and rip and stain and go through God knows what after they slide onto the bodies of their temporary owners.\u201cThere are three times during the process where we\u2019re doing a quality inspection,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. Next to her, an employee was sniffing the contents of a garment bag, one of hundreds that UPS and FedEx deliver to the warehouse each morning. \u201cCustomers sometimes tell us that there\u2019s an item they didn\u2019t wear, but our smell test is more important,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. \u201cEvery single item goes through a cleaning and sanitation process.\u201dIndustrial washers spun, dryers tumbled and garments on hangers clicked as they made their way through a maze of scaffolding, en route to a machine that would spit them out encased in plastic. \u201cThe system knows that that blouse needs to wait for a pair of jeans to come in,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. \u201cIt won\u2019t send it over to shipping until all of the items in that order have been brought together. That\u2019s something someone\u2019s wearing to an event,\u201d she said, gesturing at an off-the-shoulder gown of salmon-colored chiffon. \u201cVegas!\u201d she trilled, pointing at a white-and-red-sequined bomber jacket.Of Rent the Runway\u2019s 1,200 employees, 770 are in Secaucus. A second such facility is due to open in Dallas next year, to speed up delivery times to users not on the East Coast. An additional 130 people work on the company\u2019s engineering, information technology and analytics teams. They continually tweak algorithms to identify pieces that customers might like and highlight them on the app\u2019s home screen, similar to recommendations offered by Amazon and Netflix.\u201cWe\u2019re collecting hundreds of thousands of data points every week: style, fit of the garment, what occasion you wore that to, what else is going on in your life, who are you?\u201d said Ms. Hyman. \u201cWe\u2019re creating one-to-one style personas for every user we have, which is helping us create an individual home page for you, where we can recommend clothing that you might like. Part of that is not just to recommend the things that you\u2019re already comfortable with, but to help you discover things that you didn\u2019t know you\u2019d love.\u201d Essentially, they\u2019re using data to engineer whimsy \u2014 that feeling of seeing something in a store window and rushing in to plunk down a credit card.Rent the Runway shares its findings with the designers whose clothing it stocks. (The company buys wholesale, like a department store.) \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing amount of data that traditional retailers don\u2019t always share: What other brands is she wearing, how many times do our dresses get dry-cleaned and still come back as new?\u201d said Jan-Hendrik Schlottmann, the C.E.O. of the high-fashion label Derek Lam. \u201cYou learn a lot from that and from reading the comments the clients make online. It\u2019s great market research, frankly.\u201dMr. Schlottmann said he doesn\u2019t worry that rentals will cannibalize sales. \u201cThe Rent the Runway customer is not a customer we\u2019re losing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to spend $1,500 on a dress, because she doesn\u2019t understand the value. We kind of think we\u2019re taking money away from fast fashion by letting her try on and rent clothes. Instead of having her buy Zara\u2019s copy of our dress, I\u2019d rather have her experience our construction, our fabric. Hopefully, she will buy it when she\u2019s ready.\u201dAs a private company, Rent the Runway declined to share its revenue or profit. Ms. Hyman also declined to specify how many Unlimited members there are, but said the subscription business was up 150 percent year over year. In March, an investment of $20 million, in part from the founders of the Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba, reportedly put the company\u2019s valuation at $800 million.Even if Rent the Runway is small compared to established fashion brands, the NPD analyst Marshal Cohen considers the company\u2019s impact significant. \u201cThey are a disrupter. They have really changed the dynamic of what goes on in the marketplace,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not building wardrobes the way we used to, we\u2019re not buying as many shoes, as many bags, we\u2019re wearing a few staple items and mixing and matching them. We\u2019ve gotten so casual in the workplace that we\u2019re basically wearing loungewear.\u201dSeventy-five percent of the clothing that gets shipped out to Unlimited members falls into the broad bucket of business casual. Members have written in asking for more tailored options, and as a result, this fall, the company\u2019s business formal assortment \u2014 suits and pencil skirts by labels including Theory, Tibi and Iro \u2014 will increase 250 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s attire that a conservative lawyer could wear to the office everyday,\u201d Ms. Hyman said.Before joining Unlimited in 2016, Ariel Cohen, a 29-year-old account director for the New York public relations firm Magrino, spent about $500 a month at shops like Club Monaco and Anthropologie. She\u2019s cut that to $100 a month \u2014 and eliminated her monthly dry cleaning bill, also around $100. \u201cI make investments in things now that I consider \u2018forever pieces,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m able to have the more colorful and loud parts of my wardrobe be things that I can wear once or twice, post a pic to Instagram, and move on.\u201d She gestured at her Jason Wu pants: white, wide-legged, emblazoned with big, blue flowers. \u201cLike these, I\u2019d never buy.\u201dFor women entering the job force, Unlimited has been a crucial hack. \u201cTo go from college to my first career, it was really challenging,\u201d said Elisabeth Armstrong, 24, a former television reporter in Tennessee who recently transitioned to a finance job in Colorado. \u201cMy salary was not really conducive to buying a new wardrobe.\u201d\u201cI found myself falling into this pattern of fast fashion, buying a blazer here, a dress there,\u201d before signing up for Unlimited in 2016, Ms. Armstrong said. \u201cIt\u2019s really challenging for us, as women. Men have the standard suit. With the emphasis on your personal brand, your presentation, I think there\u2019s more weight on appearance than there ever has been.\u201d\u201cI had exhausted the options that I own \u2014 my co-workers had seen them all,\u201d said Caroline Peck, a 25-year-old advertising associate in Birmingham, Ala. \u201cRecently, I was in San Antonio for a big client meeting. I rented this beautiful dress, and even my client complimented me. Then I told them about Unlimited.\u201d Ms. Peck ended up buying the dress, a black, full-skirted Erin Fetherston number with a white Peter Pan collar.Sarah Joyce, who works at a major technology company in Los Angeles, joined Unlimited last December, feeling frumpy and uninspired by her wardrobe. Her initial attitude, she said, was: \u201cRad. I\u2019m going to take more risks, I can send it back, I\u2019m going to do the Chlo\u00e9, the Veronica Beard.\u201d\u201cI was like, now I know how female baller executives look hot,\u201d said Ms. Joyce, 40. \u201cYou\u2019re faking it till you make it. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d She got so much praise on a maroon Cinq \u00e0 Sept maxi dress that she ended up buying it for $500. Then it happened again. \u201cI ended up buying everything,\u201d said Ms. Joyce. \u201cI bought a romper, blouses. It was a problem. Ninety percent of the stuff I rented, I never returned. Then it occurred to me this stuff has been worn by other people so many times, that\u2019s probably why it\u2019s cheap.\u201dIn June, wary of devouring Unlimited\u2019s collection of designer purses, Ms. Joyce canceled her membership. She also grew weary of attracting attention at the office. \u201cIt made such a fuss at work,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Oh, is that also Rent the Runway?\u2019 I felt like a walking billboard.\u201dSome women don\u2019t mind this, like Elizabeth Derby, a 29-year-old senior product marketing manager at Artsy, an art start-up. I spoke to her this summer, when she worked at Betterment, a financial services start-up in New York. \u201cThe funny thing is, there are a lot of men that work here, more men than women, and way more guys in the office know that I use Rent the Runway because they\u2019re always commenting on stuff and saying, \u2018I wish they had that for guys,\u2019\u201d Ms. Derby said. At the time, she was part of a Slack channel that Unlimited subscribers at Betterment use to rate outfits and collect garment bags for drop-off at a showroom Rent the Runway keeps on West 15th Street in Manhattan. (Returns taken there get processed faster than those sent to the warehouse.)\u201cThere\u2019s also the sustainability factor,\u201d said her tag-checking co-worker, Danielle Shechtman. \u201cIf you keep buying clothes and not using them, it\u2019s pretty harmful for the environment.\u201dMs. Derby nodded. \u201cEvery year I get rid of four or five garbage bags of clothes. I don\u2019t even know how I accumulate them.\u201dWith unlimited options comes a kind of perverse pressure: There\u2019s no excuse to not look good. I discovered this myself in April, when I signed up for Unlimited. One major upside: Since enlisting, I\u2019ve purchased only one piece of clothing, a dress I initially rented through Unlimited. But on the app, I routinely went down the rabbit hole of comparing one potential rental to another, reading review after review, scrolling through top picks, new arrivals and categories like \u201cDress Spotlight\u201d and \u201cTrending: Statement Tops.\u201d I had to force myself to stop.It happened again in real life in August, when I visited Rent the Runway\u2019s New York showroom, a Willy Wonka-esque emporium for fashion fiends. Intending to be in and out in 20 minutes, I instead stayed for more than an hour.When I got there, a smiling greeter prompted me to sign up for a fitting room on an iPad, so I could spend time browsing and not standing in line. Salespeople \u2014 if they can be called that, since none of the merchandise had price tags \u2014 went out of their way to unload my arms as they filled with hangers.But when I got to where I was staying, I tried the dress on again and started sweating almost immediately. I ended up wearing a cotton dress I\u2019d owned for three years to the meeting. Later, I inelegantly stuffed the Marni into my suitcase and eventually sent it back to the warehouse unworn.Rent the Runway can\u2019t be expected to solve the paralysis of choice or irrationality that plagues some of us; if anything, its future plans will exacerbate those tendencies. Ms. Hyman wants customers to be able to borrow more items, from an ever-expanding library of brands, at any time they choose.\u201cThe vision is that within a few blocks of where all of our subscribers live, all over the country, our members have access to a magical closet that has inventory that\u2019s personalized to them, that they can access 24 hours a day,\u201d said Ms. Hyman. \u201cWe\u2019re building out the technology to make seamless access to that closet as delightful and frictionless as possible.\u201d She added, \u201cRent the Runway closets should feel as organic in your day as going to Starbucks.\u201dThe ephemeral, on-demand closets of Ms. Hyman\u2019s dreams would be something altogether different, and freeing. They would allow us to use our old-fashioned physical closets, and our time and energy, for something else.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018The Fear Is Coming Back\u2019 as Political Crisis Brings Sri Lanka to Brink", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWhen Sri Lanka\u2019s president was elected in 2015, he was given a sweeping mandate from voters to investigate accusations of war crimes and graft against his predecessor\u2019s government and to cancel deals with China that had plunged the country into debt.Now the president, Maithripala Sirisena, has become an agent of the attempted comeback of the man he replaced, Mahinda Rajapaksa.The parliament and public that once rallied around Mr. Sirisena are now bitterly divided over what his critics call an unconstitutional attempt to consolidate power.The country is split down the middle, with parliamentarians slightly tilted toward Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who is standing his ground despite attempts to replace him with Mr. Rajapaksa.Sri Lanka, one of Asia\u2019s oldest democracies, has now been left with two prime ministers claiming legitimacy, and concerns that violence might be used to break the stalemate.Though the current crisis appeared to have been at least partly caused by bitter personal differences between the leaders, it has geopolitical importance. India and China have been locked in an expensive competition for influence in Sri Lanka, and Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s allies blame his 2015 election defeat on meddling from New Delhi. India denies the allegations.Mr. Wickremesinghe said that any legitimate confidence vote in Parliament would confirm that he still had the votes to remain in office. \u201cI am confident that I am the only one who can get a majority. If someone else can show a majority, I will give way,\u201d Mr. Wickremesinghe said in a news conference on Monday.During his campaign in 2015, President Sirisena used the image of the journalist and cartoonist Prageeth Eknaligoda, who had been critical of Mr. Rajapaksa and disappeared in 2010, as a symbol of Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s tenure.On Monday, Mr. Eknaligoda\u2019s wife, Sandhya Eknaligoda, who campaigned for Mr. Sirisena in 2015, called Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s appointment last week \u201ca great betrayal.\u201d\u201cWhen we walked the streets for Mr. Sirisena, we walked against the politics of fear and repression. Today, the same Mr. Sirisena is bringing the man who terrorized us back to power,\u201d she said.\u201cThe fear is coming back.\u201dThe crisis appears to be the first unconstitutional transfer of power in Sri Lanka\u2019s independent history.Mr. Rajapaksa and his supporters say Mr. Wickremesinghe\u2019s government has behaved unconstitutionally by delaying provincial elections.\u201cWe are working as a caretaker government to prepare for elections next year,\u201d said Namal Rajapaksa, Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s son and a parliamentarian. Mr. Wickremesinghe\u2019s government, he said, had \u201cdelayed elections for three years and that was unconstitutional and no one said anything.\u201dMr. Wickremesinghe is currently hunkered down in his residence with hundreds of supporters and Buddhist monks surrounding the building, complicating President Sirisena\u2019s ability to oust him without a bloody showdown. The president is in charge of the armed forces and it remains unclear where they stand in the crisis.Over the weekend, a mob loyal to Mr. Rajapaksa stormed the state television broadcaster and took it off air. Some journalists say they have gotten threatening calls to support Mr. Sirisena\u2019s government.From the beginning, it seems Mr. Sirisena miscalculated how much support he could rally to oust Mr. Wickremesinghe.On Friday evening, Mr. Sirisena called members of his parliamentary bloc and representatives of the military to his residence for a meeting, which many assumed would be on policy matters, according to two officials familiar with the matter.Instead they entered Mr. Sirisena\u2019s residence to find Mr. Rajapaksa and a hastily arranged swearing-in ceremony to appoint the former leader as the new prime minister. By Saturday afternoon, parliamentarians loyal to Mr. Wickremesinghe refused to defect to Mr. Sirisena\u2019s new coalition and even some members of the president\u2019s own party declined to cross over.Mr. Wickremesinghe held a news conference on Saturday, asserting his legitimacy and demanding that parliament convene for a vote to determine the rightful prime minister. Moments later, Mr. Sirisena suspended parliament.In a national speech on Sunday evening, Mr. Sirisena claimed that a cabinet minister he did not identify had been hatching a plot to assassinate him. The claim came weeks after The Hindu, a major Indian daily, reported that Mr. Sirisena had told allies that India\u2019s intelligence agency was also planning to assassinate him. Mr. Sirisena later denied that report.Mr. Sirisena also harshly criticized Mr. Wickremesinghe, his coalition partner of the past three years, calling him \u201carrogant, stubborn and inflexible\u201d and saying the prime minister had stalled economic reforms while allowing corruption to flourish. He had no choice but to appoint Mr. Rajapaksa, he said, \u201cfor the sake of the motherland.\u201dOn Monday evening, Mr. Rajapaksa swore in a cabinet, appointing himself as finance minister in addition to his prime ministerial posting, all while the legitimacy of the change remains unclear.During Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s rule, China found an opening to pull Sri Lanka more closely into its orbit through billions of dollars in loans, some for the ruling family\u2019s pet projects. The projects and the debt they accumulated became an election issue in 2015, with Mr. Sirisena and Mr. Wickremesinghe cooperating to run on an anti-China platform.But once they came to power, they realized that India and the United States \u2014 which had also been critical of Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s rule \u2014 did not have China\u2019s deep pockets and began to gravitate toward Beijing once again.China has been nimble in its diplomacy, too. Shortly after Mr. Sirisena came to power, China\u2019s government built a hospital in his home district. After a public uproar over the Hambantota port this year, China gave Mr. Sirisena a grant worth nearly $300 million, which the president boasted was for \u201cany project of my wish.\u201dWestern governments have rallied around Mr. Wickremesinghe in the crisis, and the loans and grants they have given this government in recent years may be at risk unless the prime minister is restored. But that money pales in comparison to the loans China has provided.\u201cThe political turmoil, more than Rajapaksa\u2019s return to power, works to China\u2019s advantage. In country after country, China has exploited internal disarray to advance its objectives,\u201d said Brahma Chellaney, an analyst and critic of China who often advises the Indian government and is affiliated with the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi.China\u2019s ambassador to Sri Lanka quickly sought to show he was not taking sides, posing for photo opportunities with Mr. Rajapaksa and Mr. Wickremesinghe on Saturday.Parliament is now set to reconvene on Nov. 16, but there is concern that the delay may be used to coerce lawmakers to support Mr. Sirisena and Mr. Rajapaksa. Namal Rajapaksa, the parliamentarian, says his party and Mr. Sirisena\u2019s already have the support they need.Mr. Sirisena broke from Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s party to ally with Mr. Wickremesinghe in the prelude to the 2015 elections. But the alliance he formed with Mr. Wickremesinghe was a coalition of contrasts, with Mr. Sirisena\u2019s party notably more socially conservative.The leaders quarreled at every step and the government was paralyzed, unable to fulfill its economic or social promises. And they never held the accountability crusade they had promised, to investigate the alleged war crimes of Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s government.\u201cThis government came in and made commitments to deliver on transitional justice, to deliver truth justice and reparations for Sri Lanka\u2019s conflict,\u201d said Omar Waraich, Deputy South Asia director for Amnesty International. \u201cWhile there were some very important gains made, that process stalled, disappointing the families of victims. There is a danger now that even those limited gains will be reversed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Embattled Macron Shuffles French Cabinet, Again, in Favor of Loyalists", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe appointment of Christophe Castaner, who once declared \u201can aspect of love\u201d in his relationship with Mr. Macron, to lead the Interior Ministry came on a day of government reshuffling in lesser posts. Mr. Macron took on eight new government ministers and got rid of four others, none big names in French politics.Would the new minister, whose offices are just down the street from the president\u2019s in the heart of Paris, breathe fresh life into a government undermined by a sharp drop in public approval? Or would Mr. Macron close ranks and circle the wagons?In the end it was the latter. Mr. Castaner was one of the president\u2019s earliest supporters and has performed a variety of tasks for him. He was campaign spokesman, head of Mr. Macron\u2019s political movement, La R\u00e9publique en Marche \u2014 Republic on the Move \u2014 and indefatigable television talking head.\u201cEmmanuel is fascinating,\u201d Mr. Castaner said in an interview in a magazine, Le Point, last fall. \u201cEverything about him: his ascent, his intelligence, his vivacity, even his physical strength.\u201dThe new government\u2019s first day was stormy. On Tuesday, the police carried out searches at the homes and offices of officials of the main opposition party on Mr. Macron\u2019s left, La France Insoumise, or France Unbowed. They were looking for documents relating to a possible phony hiring scheme using public money, as well as campaign finance violations.The fiery leader of France Unbowed, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, filmed the search at his home on his phone and later angrily denounced an \u201cenormous political police operation,\u201d roaring to supporters in the kind of polemical harangue that has earned him a devoted, if still limited, following. \u201cHere, there is supposed to be freedom in this country!\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon shouted.In Parliament, Mr. Macron\u2019s prime minister, Edouard Philippe, defended the government and underlined \u201cthe independence of the justice system\u201d in the face of Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s attacks.But if France\u2019s judiciary is independent, Mr. Macron\u2019s cabinet is personally beholden to him \u2014 a reality reinforced by the selection of Mr. Castaner. In his first cabinet picks, only three of Mr. Macron\u2019s ministers had independent political followings of their own. All three are now gone, two of them grumbling to various degrees about the impossibility of shining in Mr. Macron\u2019s orbit.\u201cWe\u2019re faced with a system of power that is concentrated, controlled, locked up, to a degree that is unprecedented in the Fifth Republic,\u201d the political philosopher Marcel Gauchet said in Le D\u00e9bat, a centrist magazine, this month.\u201cWhat strikes me is that he preferred to name a Socialist at Interior, rather than someone from the right,\u201d said the political scientist G\u00e9rard Grunberg.\u201cHe needed to re-equilibrate to the left,\u201d Mr. Grunberg said. \u201cHe had to do it. He couldn\u2019t allow himself not to do it.\u201dBut in choosing a follower of unquestioned devotion, the French president brushed aside the claims of independent heavyweights on the job. One high-profile name in circulation was the Paris prosecutor Fran\u00e7ois Molins, the country\u2019s most visible face in the fight against terrorism. Mr. Macron bypassed Mr. Molins, a careful jurist who dominates media coverage in France after each terror attack, in favor of Mr. Castaner, whom Le Monde described in a recent profile as \u201cthe president\u2019s guard-dog,\u201d and \u201cthe government Swiss Army knife.\u201dCritics in Parliament immediately noted that Mr. Castaner has little experience in two of the top challenges facing France today \u2014 migration and terrorism \u2014 both under the interior minister\u2019s purview.\u201cI\u2019ve never heard him, in five years, address the fundamental questions,\u201d Eric Ciotti, a member of Parliament from France\u2019s mainstream right, told Agence-France Presse on Tuesday.Highlighting the lack of experience, Mr. Macron on Tuesday promoted France\u2019s current internal intelligence boss and the former police prefect in Marseille, Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, to be the second-in-command at the Interior Ministry.Laurent Bigorgne, head of the Institut Montaigne, a think tank close to Mr. Macron, applauded the president for reinforcing the ministry dealing with local governments, a trouble spot, as France\u2019s mayors are known to be unhappy with him. Mr. Bigorgne also dismissed the idea of choosing Mr. Molins, saying the police \u2014 which are under the Interior Ministry \u2014 would not have accepted a \u201cmagistrate\u201d giving them orders.Meanwhile, outside his party headquarters in the raffish neighborhood of the Gare du Nord in Paris, an enraged Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, the France Unbowed chief, got right down Tuesday to blasting Mr. Castaner.\u201cSo this is how the new interior minister gets going, and the minister of justice, this is what they are doing in this country, to intimidate, and to frighten,\u201d Mr. M\u00e9lenchon, wearing the patriotic red white and blue official sash, shouted to supporters who had massed in the street.Police and judicial officials have been investigating both Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s campaign finance accounts \u2014 some $510,000 worth of expenditures have been reported as questionable \u2014 and his use of parliamentary assistants for apparent political purposes at the European Parliament. That is the same offense of which Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Rassemblement National \u2014 formerly the National Front \u2014 stands accused.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sears Plan to Get Out of Bankruptcy Has a Familiar Ring", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn its bankruptcy filing on Monday, Sears argued that, given enough time and less debt, it would be able to reverse the decades-long decline of its retail business.But the company\u2019s latest turnaround plan looks a lot like its previous turnaround plans: close unprofitable stores, sell properties and borrow more money from the company\u2019s chairman and largest investor, Edward S. Lampert.Missing from that plan was any explanation of how Sears would gain the ground it had lost to big-box stores like Walmart and the e-commerce giant Amazon. In 2005, Sears had 2 percent of all retail sales. It now accounts for less than 0.3 percent, according to Customer Growth Partners, a research firm.\u201cHonestly, Sears is essentially dead already,\u201d said Gerald L. Storch, the former chief executive of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Hudson\u2019s Bay, the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue. \u201cMaybe it limps along for while. But it is walking zombie.\u201dAs part of its Chapter 11 reorganization plan, Sears says it will close 142 unprofitable stores, or about 20 percent of what remains of its once vast footprint that also includes the discount retailer Kmart. The company also plans to sell its Kenmore and Home Services brands.Those cuts would come on top of the 1,000 stores the company closed in the past decade, and the sale of brands like Lands\u2019 End, Craftsman and Sears Canada.Mr. Lampert, a hedge fund manager who has already lent the company about $2.5 billion, said he would extend another $300 million to keep the retailer operating in bankruptcy. The loan comes in addition to the more traditional financing from banks that Sears received on Monday.Mr. Lampert\u2019s hope is that by focusing only on a core group of 400 profitable stores, the company can stop hemorrhaging money and restore the confidence of its customers and vendors. Many suppliers have stopped advancing products to Sears on credit and are owed millions of dollars. Overall, Sears listed $11.3 billion in liabilities in its bankruptcy filing and $7 billion in assets.Industry analysts, investors and former retail executives said Sears\u2019s Chapter 11 filing is only a short stop on the way to liquidation.\u201cThere are not strong reasons to be optimistic,\u2019\u2019 said Alan Treadgold, a retail expert at PA Consulting. \u201cYou exit the stores that are not viable. You manage the debt. But it still leaves the fundamental question: What is the purpose of Sears?\u201dIn recent years, bankruptcy has not been kind to old-school retailers seeking a second life.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us had hoped to cut its debts and reorganize as a smaller, more nimble company when it filed a Chapter 11 case last September. But rather than keeping the company going, its lenders decided they could recoup more by putting up its toys in a fire sale and shutting down all its stores. The clothing chain Bon-Ton also liquidated earlier this year and closed all its stores.Sears could follow a similar path, particularly after Christmas when its stores have finished selling out their holiday inventory and will be less productive.The one wild card is Mr. Lampert, who has continued to sink money into the company despite long odds.In bankruptcy documents, Sears said Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge fund was willing to make the opening bid to essentially buy the company\u2019s 400 most viable stores and keep them going.In one filing, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Robert A. Riecker, said the hedge fund\u2019s \u201csupport has ensured that the company\u2019s doors remain open, and over 68,000 individuals remain employed.\u201dBut Mr. Lampert may have other reasons to make sure Sears keeps the lights on. He is the chairman of and a large investor in Seritage Growth Properties, a real estate company that owns 230 former Sears properties. Sears pays rent to Seritage and a liquidation could imperil that revenue.Since Sears sold those stores to Seritage in 2015, the value of many of its remaining stores has declined. Real estate analysts say many of these cavernous spaces are in struggling malls, making them unlikely to attract another large retailer or an ambitious redevelopment projects like office buildings or hotels.\u201cWhy Eddie is still in this is anybody\u2019s guess,\u2019\u2019 said David D. Tawil, a co-founder of Maglan Capital, a New York hedge fund, that makes investments in the debt of troubled companies but has not bought debt issued by Sears because it posed too much risk.\u201cWe are dealing with a new age in retail bankruptcies, and Sears is the weakest player in the market,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Tawil added. \u201dIf it makes it out of bankruptcy, it would be an astounding accomplishment.\u201dAs far as retail sector is concerned, analysts do not expect the company\u2019s bankruptcy filing to have much of an effect on its competitors. Competitors like Walmart, Kohl\u2019s and Home Depot took market share away from Sears and Kmart years ago. And rents and occupancy have fallen sharply in malls where Sears anchor stores have struggled.Mr. Trump blamed the retailer\u2019s decline on poor management, saying the company was \u201cimproperly run for many years.\u201d The president did not mention that his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was on the Sears board for about a decade before stepping down to join the White House administration.Advertisement"}

While the nation\u2019s attention was riveted last week by a certain Supreme Court confirmation fight, the Trump administration quietly continued its efforts to roll back environmental regulations.It\u2019s that time of year again: early fall, when sea ice in the Arctic has melted as much as it is going to melt.

Take these flowers, girl! You gotta get paid,\u2019\u201d Ms Murrell said.\u201cThis is the way narratives get changed,\u201d Mr. Walker said. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised that the large institutions weren\u2019t interested in this show because often the smaller institutions are more willing to take the risk on an unknown curator or on a disruptive idea.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re trying to be part of the conversation to open up and diversify the museum profession,\u201d said Deborah Cullen, former director of the Wallach who recently took the helm at the Bronx Museum of the Arts. \u201cThe show is definitely punching above our weight in its unprecedented level of loans,\u201d Ms. Cullen said of the Wallach.Ms. Murrell has borrowed more than 100 paintings, sculptures, photographs and works on paper from over 40 international lenders. In a concentration of works by Henri Matisse, Ms. Murrell demonstrates how his Orientalizing of black models significantly changed after several trips to New York in the early 1930s, when he went to jazz clubs and theater in Harlem.Evidence of Matisse\u2019s excitement about his time in Harlem would be accessible to any scholar looking through the artist\u2019s archive, Ms. Murrell said, \u201cbut it\u2019s just not the way Matisse had been historicized.\u201dPart of the appeal for the Orsay\u2019s director, Laurence des Cars, was the possibility of attracting \u201cnew audiences that might feel excluded from places like Orsay,\u201d she said. \u201cReactivating the way we look at some very famous works of art \u2014 that we think we know everything about \u2014 and connecting them with today\u2019s questions is very important.\u201dMight \u201cOlympia\u201d now be presented a little differently in all those art history survey classes? \u201cThat\u2019s what you always want from research,\u201d said Kellie Jones, a professor in art history and archaeology at Columbia and a reader on Ms. Murrell\u2019s dissertation. \u201cYou create a baseline that is then picked up by others.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mnuchin to Decide by Friday Whether to Cancel on Saudi Conference", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The disappearance of a Saudi dissident journalist has put Steven Mnuchin, the United States Treasury secretary, in an increasingly tenuous position as he prepares to attend an investment conference in Riyadh next week.Several top Wall Street executives have pulled out of the meeting, but as of Monday, Mr. Mnuchin still planned to attend. President Trump, speaking at an event in Georgia, said Mr. Mnuchin would make a final decision on whether to participate by Friday.Mr. Khashoggi has not been seen since he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. The Turkish authorities have alleged that Mr. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by Saudi operatives.The Saudi government has denied any wrongdoing, saying Mr. Khashoggi left the consulate shortly after his arrival. However, a person familiar with Saudi plans said Monday that the kingdom was preparing an alternative explanation of the journalist\u2019s fate, saying Mr. Khashoggi died in an interrogation gone wrong.Mr. Trump said on Monday that a decision about Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s attendance would be made by Friday.\u201cHe\u2019s going to make that decision,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see who\u2019s going.\u201dMr. Mnuchin\u2019s top spokesman, Tony Sayegh, said in a Monday interview with the Fox Business Network that the Treasury delegation was visiting five other countries as part of a long-planned trip. He also pointed out that the secretary\u2019s agenda in Saudi Arabia extends beyond the Future Investment Initiative conference and includes meetings related to blocking terrorist financing.Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, was among those arguing that Mr. Mnuchin should withdraw.\u201cUnless Trump cancels Secretary Mnuchin\u2019s trip immediately, the United States is validating the likely murder of U.S. resident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi by the Saudi government,\u201d he said.As the top economic official from the United States, Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s presence would send a significant signal about how America views human rights issues.\u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous, frankly,\u201d said Paul H. O\u2019Neill, who served as Treasury secretary under former President George W. Bush. He added that Mr. Mnuchin had little to gain from attending such a conference under the circumstances.But the timing of the conference comes at a delicate moment of economic diplomacy, making a decision to pull out fraught.The Treasury Department oversees the United States\u2019 sanctions arsenal, and Mr. Mnuchin has been aggressively urging American allies to step up pressure against Iran after Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Saudi Arabia has supported that decision, and its influence in the region is needed to help isolate Iran.Oil is also an underlying factor. Prices have surged this year, and the prospect of higher fuel costs in the United States before the November midterm elections is problematic for Republicans. Relations between Mr. Trump and the Saudis, whom he courted lavishly last year, have been strained in recent months after the president publicly pressured Saudi Arabia to ramp up oil production. This month, Mr. Trump raised eyebrows again when he suggested that Saudi Arabia should be spending more on defense.\u201cWe protect Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said at a rally in Mississippi, adding that he told King Salman that he would not last two weeks without American military support.For Mr. Mnuchin, the tension comes on the anniversary of one of his signature policy projects: the Terrorist Financing Targeting Center, which was unveiled in Riyadh on his trip last year as a multinational effort to combat illicit financial activities in the Middle East.On that trip, Mr. Mnuchin was feted by Saudi Arabia\u2019s finance minister, Mohammed al-Jadaan, and the governor of the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, Ahmed al-Kholifey, in a gilded conference room at the Ritz-Carlton on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative.At the conference, where chocolate truffles and cardamom coffee flowed freely, Mr. Mnuchin hailed the partnership with the Saudi government and said he looked forward to returning annually to ensure the center\u2019s success.Former Treasury officials were divided on the wisdom of Mr. Mnuchin traveling to Riyadh under the current circumstances.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot coming on right now,\u201d Morgan Ortagus, a former deputy United States Treasury attach\u00e9 in Saudi Arabia, referring to the oil and terrorist financing issues. \u201cI think if he pulled out at this point it would be because the administration felt there was not enough truthfulness or cooperation on this.\u201dMr. O\u2019Neill said the fact that Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, was making his own trip to Saudi Arabia could give Mr. Mnuchin a graceful opportunity to bow out. He suggested that the conference itself would offer the secretary little value, since he has easy access to business executives from around the world.\u201cIf it turns out that it\u2019s true that they caused a journalist to be assassinated, I can\u2019t imagine the secretary of the Treasury would go,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Neill said. \u201cHe is kind of a token now, in that if he pulls out, it will strengthen what the president has said, in terms of being upset with them.\u201dBut making the trip could also be an opportunity for Mr. Mnuchin.Elizabeth Rosenberg, a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said more engagement was crucial during fraught diplomatic times. One option, she said, is for Mr. Mnuchin to skip the investment conference and just pay a visit to the terrorist finance center. Or the secretary, who was planning to participate in a moderated discussion with Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the founder of Colony Capital, could give a speech addressing human rights.\u201cI think the U.S. Treasury secretary can still engage and not crush the credibility of the U.S. position of being a tough interlocutor,\u201d said Ms. Rosenberg, a former senior adviser to the department\u2019s Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes division.However, she added, it would be a dire mistake to attend the conference and avoid the human rights issue.\u201cIt would be particularly awkward if all these people had pulled out and then he had nothing further to say other than just a desire to participate,\u201d Ms. Rosenberg said.Advertisement"}

Bill Walker, a political Independent, called \u201cinappropriate\u201d but unspecified comments.The resignation threw an already tight re-election effort by Mr. Walker into even more uncertain territory with only a few weeks before voting begins.Mr. Mallott, 75, is the state\u2019s most prominent Native Alaskan politician, a member of the Tlingit people, and has been a hugely popular figure in rural tribal areas of the state. As a Democrat, he was also part of an unlikely political marriage with Mr. Walker, a former Republican who left his party to run as an Independent in 2014.In his first term, Mr. Walker repeatedly referred to Mr. Mallott as his partner in dealing with a huge budget deficit that has required painful cuts to state programs and a reduction in payments to Alaskans from a fund created by decades of oil tax revenues.And Mr. Walker was entering what appeared to be a tough gantlet in seeking a second term, facing a well-known Democratic candidate, the former United States Senator Mark Begich, and a well-financed Republican former state senator, Mike J. Dunleavy.Now, with only a few weeks left before the election, Mr. Walker\u2019s office said in a statement that it was too late to remove Mr. Mallott\u2019s name from the ballot. \u201cHe will not accept the position of lieutenant governor if elected,\u201d the statement said.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Mr. Walker said he learned on Monday night of \u201cinappropriate comments that do not reflect the sterling level of behavior required in his role as lieutenant governor.\u201dMr. Mallott\u2019s replacement, Valerie Nurr\u2019araaluk Davidson, who had been commissioner of the Department of Health and Social Services and is also Native Alaskan, suggested in her own statement that Mr. Mallott\u2019s comments involved a woman or women, though she, too, provided no specifics.\u201cRespect for women, and the dignity of all Alaskans, is our responsibility,\u201d she said. \u201cI am profoundly disappointed by his conduct.\u201dMr. Mallott was briefly the Democratic Party nominee for governor in 2014, but gave up the nomination to run at Mr. Walker\u2019s side because Mr. Mallott said that only together could they defeat the previous governor, Sean Parnell, a Republican.Mr. Mallott could not be immediately reached for comment, with a call and email to the governor\u2019s office getting no response late Tuesday afternoon. He said in his resignation letter that his comments had \u201cplaced a person whom I respect and revere in a position of vulnerability.\u201dHe said in the letter that he would seek \u201chealing for my family and for my staff, my friends and all those who have place their faith in me and been let down by my behavior.\u201d\u201cI take full responsibility for this action and apologize to, and seek healing for, the person I hurt,\u201d he added.The rapid erasure of Mr. Mallott from the executive branch website was also sharp and sudden. An internet search that turned up the lieutenant governor\u2019s website produced an error message, saying that \u201cthe page you are looking for no longer exists,\u201d and listing Ms. Davidson as the office holder.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Abroad in America: \u2018Why Does it Cost So Much (Insert Extreme Word of Choice) Money to Run for Office?\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOne of the things that most perplexes and exasperates foreigners about politics in the United States, at least according to the emails you readers have been sending me, is the thorny topic of money. Why is there so much of it? What does it buy? What effect does it have?It is true that the midterm elections are awash in money, an obscene amount of it, a grand total of something like $1.5 billion with a B \u2014 and that\u2019s before the homestretch. In contrast to the system in many other countries, where campaigns are financed mainly with public funds, candidates here can spend unlimited amounts on their campaigns \u2014 either their own funds, or money donated by individuals and political or interest groups.This unleashed a tidal wave of cash. Although they cannot donate to specific campaigns, super PACS can and do spend on any election-adjacent thing they want \u2014 taking out ads on prime-time television, for instance, or targeting voters with text messages. They are, however, required to be transparent about how much money they take in, and where and whom it comes from.Regardless of your preferred currency, the 2018 numbers are off-the-charts high for a midterm election, reflecting the seriousness of the stakes at this delicate moment in U.S. politics.Of that, $46 million of the Democrats\u2019 money has come from small donors, mostly via the sort of online donation pioneered by former President Obama, compared to $15 million for the Republicans.Analysts say this shows how seriously Democratic voters around the country are taking the midterms, and how much they want to take back Congress, currently under Republican control.\u201cWhen you see waves of small donors like this, it reflects the extent to which this election is nationalized,\u201d said Daniel I. Weiner, senior counsel in the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThe donor class, which is mostly upper class or upper-middle class, is very conscious that who gets to be the senator from Montana will affect someone\u2019s life in New York.\u201dHow likely is it that the Democrats might wrest back control of both chambers of Congress, the Senate and the House of Representatives? Not very likely when it comes to the Senate, according to the latest polls.Interestingly enough, financial advantage does not guarantee electoral success. Hillary Clinton raised more money than Mr. Trump in the 2016 election, and look at what happened to her.The most obvious current manifestation of that is taking place in the deeply Republican state of Texas, where Beto O\u2019Rourke, a Democrat, is challenging the Republican incumbent, Ted Cruz, for a U.S. Senate seat. Mr. O\u2019Rourke is a favorite of liberals across the U.S., because they love his starry charisma and because they do not like Mr. Cruz, known for his intransigence and hard-right views, at all.\u201cYou have to have the money to communicate the message, but the message has got to be able to resonate with voters,\u201d said Capri Cafaro of the American University School of Public Affairs in Washington, a former Democratic state senator in Ohio. \u201cIf your message isn\u2019t right, it\u2019s not going to win you the election.\u201d\u201cWe Canadians live next door and we hear you talking to yourselves. We get American TV, read American magazines and, in many cases, subscribe to U.S. newspapers, as I do with the Times.\u201cI think we understand you better than any other people in the world. By and large, we like and admire you as a nation.\u201cThat said, President Trump\u2019s behavior, style and character (such as it is) has caused many of us to like and admire you less. He has certainly mobilized the darker side of the American soul.\u201cBelieve it or not, I am still fond of and respectful of the U.S. as a \u2018great\u2019 (not in Trump\u2019s sense) country but I fear it has gone so far off the rails it will be very hard to bring it back.\u201d \u2014 Tim YatesA number of readers have sent similar comments and questions, reflecting a shared perception from liberals abroad who have been mystified and at times dismayed by recent events in the United States. This is particularly true in Canada and in countries in the European Union, both staunch allies that have been treated with unexpected scorn by the president.These questions are so fundamental and so profound \u2014 they speak so directly to what many Americans hear when we speak to non-Americans \u2014 that I don\u2019t feel I can address them without help. So I\u2019m going to turn this over to another reader, Barry Alexander, who is from Jackson, Tenn., and wrote in with this to say about Mr. Trump and his appeal:\u201cThe president is very different than any other in the modern age. Everyone should try very hard to keep his \u2018style\u2019 and \u2018personality\u2019 separate from his policies and proposals. I would not tweet as he does, nor campaign around the country, and many other style attributes.The president also has a style of politics that today is working. You or I might not like it, but he beat a large field of Republicans, and of course Hillary Clinton as well. He is quite predictable, he will almost always keep his policy promises, or \u2014 if he needs Congress \u2014 try to keep them.

And a fifth.Mr. Bacon, a centrist Republican seeking re-election in the only district in Nebraska that voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and sent a Democrat to Congress as recently as 2014, struggled to move the conversation along, alluding to \u201ca breakdown in the rule of law\u201d and his support for immigration measures that Democrats had blocked.But soon the banquet room, filled with a few dozen people who appeared mostly white and in their 60s and 70s, broke into chants of \u201cBuild the wall! Build the wall!\u201dBarely two weeks away from an election that threatens to sweep Republicans from power in the House of Representatives and dash any lingering hope of conservative immigration reform, the party, led by President Trump, is leaning more aggressively into dark portrayals of undocumented immigrants in a bid to galvanize voters.Mr. Trump, whose political appeal among his core voters has largely been rooted in warnings about illegal immigration as a threat to American security, sovereignty and identity, has stepped up his hard-line, inflammatory attacks on Latin American migrants as he travels the country campaigning to save Republicans\u2019 majorities in the House and Senate.His renewed emphasis on the issue reflects the belief by strategists in both parties that Republican candidates often benefit if they can link illegal immigration to crime, economic insecurity and terrorism \u2014 all resonant concerns with swing voters, especially women \u2014 and portray Democrats as too spineless to tackle the problem.Mr. Trump is also trying to link the issue to another powerful factor in the midterms: himself. With his legislative agenda\u2019s fate on the line, Mr. Trump, without offering any evidence, is accusing political opponents of orchestrating an invasion of foreigners so he and the Republicans will lose in November.\u201cA lot of money has been passing to people to come up and try and get to the border by Election Day, because they think that\u2019s a negative for us,\u201d he told the crowd. (How this would be a negative, he left unexplained, though he has falsely blamed his loss in the popular vote in 2016 on illegal voting by undocumented immigrants.)It did not appear that call would be coming. Democrats, in what amounts to a tacit acknowledgment of the power of Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, have mostly refrained from responding directly to his unfounded charges. In a joint statement on Saturday, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said the president was \u201cdesperate to change the subject from health care to immigration.\u201dExplaining how Trump supporters were likely to view illegal immigration, Mr. Nunberg said, \u201cOnce again, we believe that Donald Trump is under attack, and that the Democrats are orchestrating it.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Some strategists who have been advising Democrats on immigration issues have instructed them not to get drawn into a detailed debate by Republicans seeking to attack their positions, but to quickly pivot to friendlier terrain such as health care and wages.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to fall for his race-baiting divisiveness; they\u2019re going to promise to bring people together to address everyday challenges,\u201d said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America\u2019s Voice, an immigration advocacy group.The migrants cite various reasons for their journey. Some say they are fleeing gangs that terrorize their neighborhoods. Others cite searching for work and more stability for their families. Advocacy groups have, in the past, used caravans to draw attention to the desperate situation in countries like Honduras and push the United States to relax its immigration laws.Coverage of the caravan has become a vehicle for other conspiratorial story lines that are popular on the right. Sometimes they spread with the help of the president.\u201cCan you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?\u201d the president said on Twitter.Most Republicans are not unhappy with legal immigration, polling shows. An independent Grinnell College survey conducted in late August and early September found that just 21 percent of Republicans said the country had too many legal immigrants, compared with 12 percent of Democrats.The Grinnell poll also found Republicans were more likely to be worried about illegal immigration. Fifty-two percent incorrectly believed that undocumented immigrants committed more violent crimes than the general population, compared with 28 percent of Americans who believed that.In polling conducted for Mr. Bannon, the issue of illegal immigration substantially affected voters\u2019 perceptions of the two parties, helping to shrink a 9-point advantage for Democrats to 2 points.The issue is often powerful in the most competitive races, like Mr. Bacon\u2019s.In Nebraska, polling conducted by the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, consistently found that the top two issues for voters were immigration and health care.Mr. Bacon\u2019s district, which covers most of Omaha and its suburbs, is 1,100 miles from the Mexican border and 73 percent white. Like many Republicans who have tried to spend their time with voters talking up the growing economy and lower tax rates, he is finding that immigration keeps coming up. In an interview after his remarks to the Republican businesswomen\u2019s club, Mr. Bacon described an exchange he had just had with a constituent. \u201cShe goes, \u2018Don, we don\u2019t care if they separate families,\u2019\u201d to which the congressman said he replied, \u201cWell, you\u2019re in the minority.\u201d\u201cI said I can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Bacon added. \u201cI have to be honest.\u201dJeremy W.

{"Headline": "Bust Magazine Is on a Mission", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "Jane is gone. Teen Vogue (the print version) is gone. The Village Voice, gone. How has this feminist lifestyle publication survived for 25 years?Supported by\u201cThe blood\u2019s not real,\u201d said a staffer at the Brooklyn headquarters of Bust, the independent, feminist lifestyle magazine and website. Her tattooed and bare arms were streaked with red, as were those of an intern, who quipped, \u201cJust another day at the office.\u201d They had been working on a photo shoot for a Halloween-themed haunted house feature.It was a symbolic moment. You don\u2019t need to be a shrink to associate red with power and boldness, as well as with important womanly issues, much as Bust does.Bust is a rarity, having kept its cult following while staying afloat in a media sea of bankruptcies, mergers and buyouts. Founding editors Debbie Stoller and Laurie Henzel started the magazine with a Riot Girls sensibility in 1993. Twenty-five years later, they are still here.\u201cWe started Bust because women\u2019s magazines were crap and made people feel bad about themselves,\u201d Ms. Stoller, 55, said from her office, located in Sunset Park\u2019s Industry City. \u201cI wanted to make women feel better and make a different kind of women\u2019s magazine.\u201dTheir aim was not purely political though; they wanted the magazine to be fun. \u201cBust has never asked readers to divide ourselves into politics versus fashion or seriousness versus adventure,\u201d said Gloria Steinem, the political activist who co-founded Ms. Magazine in 1972, in an email.In the early \u201990s, Ms. Stoller and Ms. Henzel started asking friends \u201cto write stories they didn\u2019t see reflected in the media about their lives,\u201d Ms. Stoller recalled. \u201cWe Xeroxed 500 copies at work, and that was our first issue.\u201dThe magazine was a good 15 years ahead of the outspoken and unapologetic feminist content that would happen online in the aughts, said Anna Holmes, editorial director at Topic.com, a visual storytelling platform, which is part of First Look Media.\u201cBust was an examination of gender politics,\u201d said Ms. Holmes, who was also the founder of the feminist blog Jezebel and its editor in chief for three years. \u201cBust has legitimacy and authenticity because they predate all of the feminist websites, newsletters and verticals that cropped up in 2009 through today.\u201dThe scrappy magazine has endured financial struggles (it still does); being bought by a tech company and then having to buy itself back; the bursting of the internet bubble; Sept. 11; losing business partners; multiple office moves around New York as the city became more expensive; and perhaps most importantly, the implosion of the magazine print business. Old print competitors like Jane and Teen Vogue are long gone. Other downtown alternative outfits, like The Village Voice, have also stopped publication.A Trump bump in 2016 helped, as enraged women took to the web, each looking for ways to lend their support. They donated money to Bust; its subscriptions increased. But the enthusiasm was short-lived. The website is particularly hard to finance because of changing Facebook algorithms and Google ads that don\u2019t bring in much revenue.All that said, since Bust\u2019s inaugural issue, not much has changed in terms of its goals or content, or even its funding. Ms. Stoller and Ms. Henzel didn\u2019t have money then; they don\u2019t have much now.\u201cThese are passion projects. We\u2019re scrappy. We barter,\u201d Ms. Henzel, 54, said.When times are especially lean, Ms. Stoller explained, she and Ms. Henzel cut their own salaries so as not to bring on debt (the magazine has always been debt-free, she said). \u201cWe never spend more than we have. We find cheaper ways to do things, we learn new skills so we don\u2019t have to outsource. And we make sure we balance out.\u201dSometimes that works, sometimes not. Over the past two months, neither Ms. Henzel nor Ms. Stoller have paid themselves at all.\u201cIf we did, we wouldn\u2019t be able to pay our staff. There isn\u2019t enough money,\u201d Ms. Stoller said. \u201cOur salaries are the first things we cut. We did it once before in 2008, and now again. It\u2019s harder and harder to get people to pay for anything, especially when people are producing all this content and giving it away for free and living off investors\u2019 dollars.\u201dThe Bust team is small. There are six full-time employees and a handful of part-timers; a web editor, a freelance ad sales person, an editor on the West Coast, and rotating interns. Together, Ms. Stoller and Ms. Henzel wear various professional hats, including editor in chief, publisher, creative director, circulation and distributions manager, web design, human resources and senior finance officer.The magazine, which is published six times a year, has approximately 10,000 subscribers. There are also newsstand sales and a pass-along circulation rate bringing it up to 70,000. The website fetches an average of 500,000 unique visitors every month.\u201cI learned so much from Bust\u2019s website,\u201d said Rachele Merliss, 21, a senior at Wesleyan University in Connecticut who was an intern this past summer. \u201cI\u2019ve been really interested in feminist and social justice issues since middle school.\u201d Ms. Merliss was able to write every day, she said, publishing articles about the culture of inappropriate behavior by male counselors at summer camps; the controversy over banning straws; and equal pay for black women.Bust has provided opportunities for young writers to stretch their muscles and build their brands. But there\u2019s a caveat.Interns and web writers write for free, and freelancer rates are humble. \u201cPeople pitch us and don\u2019t realize we only pay $150-$200 for features in the magazine. When we tell them, sometimes they don\u2019t care; sometimes they take it elsewhere,\u201d Ms. Henzel said. \u201cIf they can\u2019t place it, they come back,\u201d she said, explaining that clips from Bust still hold cachet in the publishing world.Aileen Gallagher, an associate professor of magazine journalism at Syracuse University, agrees that Bust is respected.\u201cI interviewed Samantha Bee in 2003 for them. I was 25. It was my first national clip, and it meant I was legit,\u201d said Ms. Gallagher, who was paid $150. Today, she still writes the occasional unpaid book review for Bust simply because she wants to. \u201cI became a feminist from reading Bust,\u201d she said. \u201cThey take chances on writers and publish a lot of women of color. Writing reviews for nothing is how I support them,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not a financially sound business model, but it is socially responsible.\u201dMany celebrities still seem game to be on Bust's cover, too. Bjork, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Solange Knowles, Amy Sedaris and Cher, among many other big names, have made appearances. The comedian Jenny Slate recently hosted Bust\u2019s 25th anniversary party, with performances by Phoebe Robinson of 2 Dope Queens, the singer-songwriter Erykah Badu and the actress Amber Tamblyn.\u201cThere\u2019s more and more competition within the craft fair space, and we really count on these to generate income. Without them we wouldn\u2019t be able to do this magazine,\u201d Ms. Henzel said. \u201cThen other people started doing them too, so we had to get creative in addition, like offering classes at the event.\u201dAh, the paradox of being rebellious in a capitalistic world.\u201cBust was one of the original resistance magazines,\u201d Mr. Husni said. \u201cThey never let an ad influence their decision, they remained in touch with their audience, and they provided an antidote for women before it was the norm,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have a lot of financial trouble, but they were on a mission. When you\u2019re on a mission, you\u2019re not going to let anyone stop you. Their subscribers feel the magazine is like a membership card to a community. That keeps the magazine going.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "China to Pump $175 Billion Into Its Economy as Slowdown and Trade War Loom", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China is signaling that it is worried about its economy.Troubled by slowing growth, persistent debt problems and President Trump\u2019s trade war, the Chinese government has taken steps in recent months to shore up its economy. It has pared back a high-profile campaign to tackle debt. It has restarted big infrastructure projects, a traditional economic engine. It has even censored bad economic news.On Sunday, Beijing went one step further.The People\u2019s Bank of China, the central bank, pulled a financial lever that will effectively pump $175 billion into the economy. The government is aiming to help small and midsize businesses in particular, which have had trouble obtaining loans and face other rising pressures.The move signals that China\u2019s economy \u201cis really not doing well,\u201d Chen Shouhong, the founder of the investment information platform Gelonghui, wrote on WeChat, a popular Chinese social media service.So far, the trade war has had only a minor impact on China\u2019s $12 trillion economy. Trade isn\u2019t as important to China as it once was, thanks in part to the rise of a middle class that has been a ready buyer of Chinese goods at home. Still, tariffs could hurt the economy the longer they last. In September, new export orders \u2014 one indicator of China\u2019s manufacturing \u2014 fell to the lowest level since 2016.But China has bigger problems than the trade war.About $65.5 billion of that cash injection will be directed to banks to repay debts that are due in coming weeks, while the rest will be pushed into the financial market.The central bank made the move to ensure \u201creasonable and sufficient liquidity\u201d in China\u2019s economy, it said. This is the fourth time this year that the central bank has cut the reserve ratio.But this time, the reserve ratio cut, which is set to go into effect on Oct. 15, was unusually big and broad. While the central bank cut the reserve ratio by a similar amount earlier this year, it put more conditions on how banks could use the extra money. The bank has shied away from making such stark moves in recent years, as it has found more subtle ways to adjust the amount of money in China\u2019s financial system depending on its needs.The announcement on Sunday suggests the central bank felt it had to do more than that. The size and breadth of the move, wrote Mr. Chen, the Gelonghui founder, shows \u201cthere are fewer and fewer tools in the P.B.O.C. toolbox.\u201dThe move was in direct response to the slowing growth, Zhang Ming, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said on Sunday. Mr. Zhang predicted that China\u2019s third-quarter gross domestic product would drop to 6.6 percent growth compared with 6.8 percent a year ago and that its fourth-quarter figure could be as low as 6.4 percent. China posted economic growth of 6.7 percent in the quarter that ended in June, though China\u2019s official figures are widely doubted.\u201cSino-U.S. trade frictions will further reduce the contribution of imports and exports to economy growth,\u201d Mr. Zhang, who is also chief economist at Ping An Securities, wrote on WeChat.\u201cIf export growth slows down due to trade frictions, it will influence manufacturing investment growth,\u201d he added.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}

His friends remain active in the ranks and they still trust him,\u201d said Ahmad Shah Safr, an Afghan analyst. \u201cHe is under Pakistan influence now.\u201dHow Mullah Baradar acts going forward, the analyst said, will be \u201ca sign of what Pakistan wants to do \u2014 whether Pakistan wants to move this process toward peace talks positively, or to stall them again.\u201dAt the time of his arrest, Mullah Baradar had initiated secret contacts with the Afghan government, then led by Hamid Karzai, a move that had angered Pakistan, which has long provided the Taliban leadership with sanctuary.By arresting him, and a dozen more Taliban commanders in the weeks after, Pakistan made clear to the insurgent leaders that they could not negotiate independently.In recent years, the Afghan government has sought unsuccessfully to initiate peace talks with the Taliban both directly and through Pakistan. But Taliban officials have insisted on speaking with the Americans first.The American diplomats seem to be moving with a sense of urgency in their efforts to convince the Taliban to engage in peace negotiations, partly reflecting President Trump\u2019s weariness for the war.Afghan officials have since demanded clarity from the Americans and reassurances that their government is not excluded from such talks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will One State Go It Alone to Make Polluters Pay?", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProponents say Washington State is a good place to try out carbon reduction ideas because it has abundant hydropower and a waning reliance on fossil fuels. The coal-fired power plant near Centralia, Wash., is scheduled to start shutting down in the next few years.CENTRALIA, Wash. \u2014 The last coal mine in Washington State closed down about a decade ago in Centralia, about 65 miles south of Seattle, leaving scars on the land and the local economy. Now, a solar electricity project \u2014 perhaps the largest in the state \u2014 is planned for the same location, by the same company that once ran the mine.Bob Guenther sees that as a sign that the struggling stretch of Washington State where he has lived most of his life can find a new way forward.\u201cThat\u2019s the vision, a clean energy hub,\u201d said Mr. Guenther, 74, who worked for three decades at a coal-fired power plant in Centralia that is scheduled to start shutting down in a few years. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new economy, and we\u2019re going to have to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and do everything we can to get it.\u201dOne piece of that transformation, Mr. Guenther said, will be decided on Election Day by people across the state, who will vote on whether to charge companies and utilities for their carbon emissions. The proposed carbon fees, aimed at curbing climate change by making the burning of fossil fuels more expensive, would be the first such state initiative in the nation, and other states are closely watching the election outcome.Opponents like Gary Stamper, a county commissioner and former school principal, said he feared that the rural area around Centralia would see little of the financial benefit from the fees the state collects, while the companies that pay the fees would pass the extra costs along to residents. That would be hard on Centralia, which is still trying to recover from the coal mine closure in 2006 and the national recession that followed.\u201cIt would hurt my constituents,\u201d Mr. Stamper said, adding that the last thing this region needs are more economic challenges: \u201cNot that I\u2019m not supporting clean air or clean water and all the things that go along with it, but it seems to me we\u2019re going to bear the brunt.\u201dIf the initiative passes, the fees would start at $15 for each ton of gases produced in fossil-fuel combustion, and would rise over time. Some major industries, like aviation, would be exempt, but even so, the fees would still be expected to raise $2.3 billion in the first five years.A previous carbon-pricing effort was defeated by Washington voters in 2016, and a plan by Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, to pass a carbon pricing system through the Legislature died earlier this year without a vote. Shaping those debates was Washington\u2019s defining political tension, between liberal-leaning residents of the economically booming Puget Sound area near Seattle and the more conservative, less prosperous rural areas to the east and south.This time around, there are notable differences. The earlier efforts called for carbon taxes; this year\u2019s version is technically not a tax but a fee, which may sound more palatable to voters. Unlike tax receipts, which legislators could get their hands on to use for other purposes, the fee revenue would have be spent on efforts like carbon and pollution reduction and forest health programs under a specified formula.Some environmental groups opposed the previous ballot measure because it also would have lowered other taxes, meaning that the state would not have netted much new revenue for climate or energy projects.If the carbon fee initiative passes, the investments it would finance could include anything from energy efficiency upgrades to electrified transit projects. Aid to low-income residents and to workers who are displaced from fossil-fuel industries are built into the measure as well.Washington starts the conversation about energy at a different place than any other state in the nation. By virtue of the region\u2019s topography, hydrology and the engineering feats of the federal dam builders who began remaking the Columbia River basin in the 1930s, the energy debate in the Pacific Northwest is distinct.Large-scale power production from the dams \u2014 more than twice as much as Oregon, the No. 2 state for hydropower output \u2014 means that Washington already emits less carbon dioxide for each unit of energy it produces than any other state, according to federal figures. What\u2019s more, the Pacific Northwest has little oil or gas to drill for or fight over, and the region\u2019s coal deposits have played out or become uneconomical.Supporters of a carbon fee say the state\u2019s extensive base of renewable, nonpolluting energy makes it the perfect laboratory to test efforts like this, because the economic impact would be less dramatic than in big coal states like West Virginia or Kentucky.Opponents say the state\u2019s unusual characteristics and the way the ballot measure is structured will make the carbon fee unfair and unlikely to have an impact on air quality or climate change. Consumers could pay higher costs, they say, and some industries will be hit far harder than others because of the exemptions. Among those who would receive exemptions is TransAlta, which owns the soon-to-close coal-fired power plant in Centralia as well as the old coal mine where the new solar installation is planned.The pain of a long economic downturn, though, runs deep. Unemployment remains higher in Lewis County, which includes Centralia, than the state average, and wages there are lower.Not long ago, TransAlta donated 1,000 acres of land to go toward new economic development. But the industrial park planned for that land is empty so far, home to elk, geese and an occasional wandering bear. Some potential tenants have expressed hesitancy to make a commitment until the carbon-fee question is answered at the ballot box, said Allyn Roe, the industrial park\u2019s chief operating officer.\u201cThe uncertainty is not helping,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The rule and the hubbub over it are part of a debate over a concept known as \u201cdata localization,\u201d in which a country places restrictions on data as a way to gain better control over it and potentially curb the power of international companies. American firms have lobbied hard against data localization rules around the world.In India, Visa, Mastercard and American Express, as well as other financial players like Amazon and PayPal, said they needed more time to comply with the order by the country\u2019s banking regulator, the Reserve Bank of India.The companies told the R.B.I. that their fraud detection and other data processing systems were distributed on machines across the world and could not be quickly redesigned to work in India alone. As an alternative, they offered to store copies of the Indian data in the country for easy access by regulators, tax authorities and law enforcement.But the R.B.I. would have none of it. In recent phone calls to the top Indian executives of the major payments companies and in letters to the companies last week, the banking regulator warned that it would take action, including imposing fines, if they missed the Monday night deadline.Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, said the payments companies were frustrated with the regulators. \u201cThey refuse to sit down and have a discussion,\u201d said Dr. Aghi, whose policy group counts the head of Mastercard on its board.Spokesmen for Visa and American Express declined to comment on their response to the local storage rule. Representatives of Mastercard and the R.B.I. did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Amazon, which operates an India-only payments service that uses elements of its global technology platform, said in a statement: \u201cCompliance with local laws and regulation is a top priority for us in all the countries we operate in. We continue to work closely with the regulator towards this.\u201dIts policy changed as other arms of the Indian government \u2014 spurred by both a privacy ruling from the Supreme Court and India-first nationalists in the governing Bharatiya Janata Party \u2014 had begun deliberating over much bigger changes to the country\u2019s data, e-commerce and privacy laws.India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has portrayed himself abroad as a pro-business leader who welcomes foreign investment. At the same time, the right wing of his party has pushed him to adopt more protectionist, India-first policies to appeal to voters, and law enforcement officials have urged him to make sure they can easily get data on residents when they need it.The Trump administration and the bipartisan India caucus of the United States Senate have both urged India to reconsider its data localization campaign, in part because India\u2019s own outsourcing companies depend on moving data across borders to offer their services.On Friday, the co-chairmen of the India caucus, Senators John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, wrote to Mr. Modi warning that data localization \u201cwill have negative impacts on the ability of companies to do business in India, may undermine your own economic goals and will likely not improve the security of Indian citizens\u2019 data.\u201dDr. Aghi, who has helped American financial firms press their case with the Indian government, said top executives of the big payments companies were summoned to a meeting on Wednesday with B. P. Kanungo, who oversees regulation of payments at the R.B.I.At that meeting, the payments companies asked for 12 more months to fully localize Indian financial data. But R.B.I. officials insisted that the companies meet the Monday night deadline.In a follow-up letter to India\u2019s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, Dr. Aghi said the R.B.I. had improperly suggested that the foreign financial firms seek assistance from iSpirt, a technology think tank in Bangalore with close ties to the government and Indian financial-services players.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Walker, Governor of Alaska, Suspends Campaign Amid Sinking Polls", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Bill Walker of Alaska, a political independent who has been fighting an uphill battle for a second term, suspended his campaign on Friday and announced he was throwing his support behind his Democratic challenger. With only a few weeks before the election, the announcement upended the race, which until now had three candidates.\u201cI believe we cannot win a three-way race,\u201d said Mr. Walker, a former Republican who left his party to win election as an independent in 2014. Mr. Walker said he had concluded that former United States Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat, \u201chas a better chance of running a competitive race\u201d against their Republican opponent, Mike J. Dunleavy, a well-financed Republican former state senator.\u201cAlaskans deserve a choice other than Mike Dunleavy,\u201d Mr. Walker said. He urged his followers to vote for Mr. Begich even though his own name will still be on the ballot.The announcement, which came as a shock to many, added chaos to a race in a pivotal time for the state. Alaska has struggled for years with a financial crisis in the capital, Juneau, and the next governor will face significant challenges. A recession has erased thousands of jobs as the oil industry, crucial to the economy, has slumped. Rising crime and homelessness have become major issues especially in Anchorage, the state\u2019s largest city.Even before Mr. Walker\u2019s announcement, his campaign was in disarray after the sudden resignation this week of the lieutenant governor, Byron Mallott, who left office after making unspecified comments that Mr. Walker described as \u201cinappropriate.\u201dFrom the start, Mr. Walker, 67, was not a conventional governor. As an independent, he had no party to back him in the Legislature, and over time he had irked some of his former allies. Though Mr. Walker had been a Republican, he served alongside a Democrat, Mr. Mallott. Mr. Walker also made many enemies among Republicans by defeating Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican who had been seeking re-election in 2014.Complicating matters, control in Juneau already was split. Republicans dominate the State Senate, but a coalition led by Democrats controls the House of Representatives.Mr. Walker\u2019s term also saw struggles over taxes and a recession in Alaska. Most of Alaska\u2019s government is supported by taxes paid by the oil companies, and falling revenues have strained the budget. Mr. Walker cut spending but also proposed fees and taxes, including the restoration of a personal income tax in Alaska; the Legislature rejected that notion.As governor, Mr. Walker was careful not to burn bridges with Republicans in trying to get legislation passed. But in his statement to Alaskans on Friday, he was far less conciliatory. In a point-by-point analysis of Mr. Dunleavy\u2019s record and statements on campaign trail, Mr. Walker made it clear that he viewed Mr. Dunleavy as the wrong choice for the state on everything from taxes to health care.\u201cOn balance, it is my belief that despite my many differences with Mark Begich, his stance on the important issues I have listed above more closely align with my priorities for Alaska,\u201d Mr. Walker said.Mr. Begich, a former mayor of Anchorage, served one term in the United States Senate, and was narrowly defeated in 2014 \u2014 the same year Mr. Walker won office as governor \u2014 by Dan Sullivan, a Republican and the former state attorney general. Mr. Begich entered the race for governor in June of this year, complicating Mr. Walker\u2019s re-election plans from the beginning. Mr. Begich\u2019s candidacy raised hopes by Republicans that Democratic-leaning voters would be split between Mr. Begich and Mr. Walker, opening a path to victory for Mr. Dunleavy.Uncertain now was how voters might respond to Mr. Walker\u2019s departure. Would Republicans or independents who favored Mr. Walker turn to the Democrat? Would some people see Mr. Walker\u2019s name on the ballot and vote for him even though he has said not to?Early voting begins on Monday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Offering Inspiration and Advice, Real Vision Is HGTV for Hedge Fund Hopefuls", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKieran O\u2019Dea rises at 5 a.m. to begin his daily routine, shuffling to his desk to eye his portfolio: a cluster of biotechnology stocks and a bet that Tesla will go bust.His office consists of an unmade bed, two computer screens and a stunning view of Long Island Sound. Mr. O\u2019Dea may be master of his own hedge fund, but he could not be more disconnected from the Wall Street machine. No sell-side research clogs his inbox. He does not own a Bloomberg terminal. And there is no TV tuned to CNBC, the financial news hub ubiquitous on trading floors.\u201cI hardly watch it \u2014 and I don\u2019t have access to any of that other stuff, either,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cI get all my market access from Twitter and Real Vision.\u201dReal Vision offers a way to skip the traditional hedge fund path: slog away at an investment bank or a mutual fund, then settle down in Midtown Manhattan or Greenwich, Conn. For a modest fee, Real Vision will connect investors to a network of elite Wall Street analysts, traders and hedge fund managers, making it easier for novices like Mr. O\u2019Dea to jump the line.Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund executive who also worked at Goldman Sachs and runs an investment strategy service called Global Macro Investor, co-founded Real Vision. Since then, 20,000 people have signed up, paying $180 a year to hear directly from financial insiders.Real Vision also celebrates the hedge fund life \u2014 the outsize trades, houses and swagger \u2014 and tempts aspirants like Mr. O\u2019Dea into thinking that they, too, might join the club.It is a world that Mr. Pal, who earlier in his career pitched ideas to luminaries like Paul Tudor Jones and George Soros, knows well. He said he was motivated to start Real Vision after watching CNBC\u2019s coverage of the financial crisis and thinking there was an opening for deep dives into finance\u2019s most arcane areas.\u201cThe media was too busy treating finance as entertainment and sound bites,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are going to cheerlead while this thing is going up, you have to warn them of the risks. It is a moral obligation.\u201dBut there\u2019s still an element of theater to Real Vision. Recently, Mr. Pal interviewed Michael Novogratz, a billionaire investor specializing in cryptocurrencies, in his office. During the discussion on the ups and downs of Bitcoin, Mr. Novogratz wore pink jeans that matched his sneakers and took a seat in front of an original leather jumpsuit worn by the motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, standing in a glass case under neon lights.Mr. Pal had flown in from his home in the Cayman Islands, and he displayed an untucked shirt, sneakers without socks and a stubble beard. It could well have been a scene from \u201cBillions,\u201d the television show about the machinations and appetites of hedge fund titans.\u201cI used to think that these guys were gods,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cBut if you spend enough time watching them, you can figure out what they are up to.\u201dAnd if his formative experience was being a world-ranked video game player \u2014 in both World of Warcraft and Smite, he said \u2014 not a striving investment banker, so what? Mr. O\u2019Dea watched the best gamers as he honed his craft once before. How hard could it be?\u201cIt has been my total school \u2014 I mean, I had no idea what a bear market or a bull market was when I started,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cIt was like watching people play video games.\u201dCurrently, 9,790 hedge funds are plying their trade, according to HFR, an industry tracker. With so many options, the pressure to perform has never been greater.The last time hedge funds collectively beat the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was 2008. So far this year, Hedge Knight is up 37 percent Mr. O\u2019Dea said, soundly beating the index\u2019s 9 percent increase and thrashing the near-flat return the fund\u2019s peer group has delivered.Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s grandfather Leonard E. Baum was Hedge Knight\u2019s main financial backer until his death. Propped up against Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s window is a faded photograph of Mr. Baum, a mathematician who put in place the trading framework that James H. Simons, the founder of Renaissance Technologies, employed to make his $84 billion Medallion Fund one of the world\u2019s most successful hedge funds. Sitting in a lawn chair, Mr. Baum has his toddler grandson in a tight hug.If his grandfather was Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s main source of capital, Real Vision is his source of inspiration.In the video, Mr. Hart wears his hair slicked back and spins tales of accumulating art, becoming an expert in Brazilian jujitsu and living in the moment \u2014 what he refers to as \u201cchasing flow.\u201d\u201cI wanted to be that guy,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea recalled.He made a pilgrimage to Texas to meet Mr. Hart, and they bonded over biotechnology companies. Mr. O\u2019Dea was curious about the science of disease: His grandfather suffered from cone-rod dystrophy, a condition that erodes vision, and his younger brother Brennan \u2014 the only other employee at Hedge Knight \u2014 is afflicted with over a half-dozen autoimmune illnesses. Brennan O\u2019Dea spends nine months a year in a small cabin in Idaho, studying biology and scanning the market for cutting-edge companies. He has selected all 12 biotech stocks in Hedge Knight\u2019s portfolio.Real Vision has plenty of believers.\u201cI have been a subscriber since they were two months old,\u201d said Chase Taylor, 35, an Air Force officer whose dream is to sell investment research to hedge funds.He has not worked in the industry, nor did he go to business school. \u201cI figured if these guys are doing it, I can too,\u201d he said.When Mr. Pal told subscribers in early 2017 that he was raising $7 million from outside investors, 1,700 offered to invest. He ultimately increased the sum to $10 million, and 50 subscribers became shareholders, although neither Mr. O\u2019Dea nor Mr. Taylor is among them.Take Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s fund: a dozen biotechnology stocks, some with values below $50 million, and a bet that Tesla goes bankrupt. It is a very risky portfolio, especially for a manager with such limited experience.Real Vision is careful to present its strategies as trading ideas \u2014 not recommendations. At the end of each video, an employee warns investors to weigh their risk appetite before jumping in.Ultimately, Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s contention that in finance \u2014 as with video games \u2014 you can ascend to an elite level by scrutinizing what the best players do remains unproven.Which does not mean he won\u2019t give it a shot.\u201cNow, I know what I am doing,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cAnd guess what: I am a 29-year-old hedge fund manager.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pakistan Seeks I.M.F. Bailout as Government Sends Mixed Messages", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe concern surrounding Pakistan\u2019s economic course and Mr. Khan\u2019s intentions has clearly left the I.M.F. skeptical, and the result may be a tough road ahead for the country if it is to get its bailout.The fund\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, insisted on Thursday that Pakistan provide \u201cabsolute transparency\u201d on its debts, many of which are owed to China as part of its Belt and Road construction program. Pakistan is a showcase for China\u2019s initiative, hosting up to $62 billion of Chinese investments, most financed by costly loans taken from Chinese state-owned banks.Any bailout for Pakistan would require \u201ccomplete understanding and absolute transparency about the nature, size, and terms of the debt that is bearing on a particular country,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said, as she prepared to meet the Pakistani delegation later Thursday at the I.M.F. and World Bank Group annual meetings in Bali, Indonesia.Later that day, the I.M.F. released a statement saying that Ms. Lagarde had met the Pakistani team and that the fund would send a team to Islamabad in the coming weeks to initiate discussions for a bailout program.Ahead of Pakistan\u2019s July elections, Mr. Khan promised to open up the books on Chinese investments and even cut projects that were unnecessary or too costly. Pakistan\u2019s previous government, led by ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was harshly criticized for refusing to publicly disclose the financing terms and conditions around China\u2019s investments, leaving the country in the dark about exactly how much debt it has committed to repay.Although Pakistan faces an external debt burden of $8 billion this year, the first payments to China as part of the Belt and Road Initiative come due in 2019, with $1 billion owed, officials say. Pakistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves hit a four-year low last week, hovering at $8.4 billion according to the central bank. That is less than enough to cover even just two months of imports.\u201cGoing to the I.M.F. was inevitable. There was no other way out, not only to bridge the financing gap but to provide confidence to the markets,\u201d said Farrukh Saleem, the spokesman for Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Economy.He added: \u201cEven if China had given $26 billion to Pakistan, it doesn\u2019t give confidence to the markets. It\u2019s not just about the bailout but getting into an I.M.F. monitoring program,\u201d which gives investors assurance that Pakistan is taking on needed economic reforms, allowing the country to tap other debt markets.Although Mr. Khan maintains that he will pursue both the I.M.F. bailout and loans from \u201cfriendly countries,\u201d those statements contradict the stance of both his finance minister and information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, who said that the conditions on those outside loans were unacceptable.\u201cWe spoke with the United Arab Emirates, China, Saudi Arabia and held consultations with other countries,\u201d Mr. Chaudhry said in televised remarks Tuesday. \u201cWe did not want to take the money the way it was being given to us.\u201dOn the campaign trail before the July elections, Mr. Khan championed austerity even as he promised to build an Islamic welfare state. The new project to build five million housing units is a signature part of his \u201cNaya Pakistan\u201d agenda \u2014 meaning New Pakistan \u2014 to kick-start the economy and provide support to the country\u2019s poorest.But going to the I.M.F. will likely mean cuts to those welfare state dreams.\u201cWith the I.M.F., there will be an impact on the government not fulfilling its election promises. But welcome to the real world,\u201d said Mr. Saleem, the economy ministry spokesman.The contradicting remarks coming out of Islamabad have left investors confused about how seriously Mr. Khan\u2019s government will commit to the I.M.F.\u2019s austerity terms. This would be the latest in at least 12 I.M.F. programs Pakistan has undertaken in the last few decades, failing to complete the structural reforms required in all but one bailout package.\u201cThis crisis could have been averted better if the government had declared their plan two months ago, when they came to power. Instead they gave mixed messages, leaving the markets guessing. A lot of damage could have been averted with timely clarity,\u201d said Ashraf Wathra, the former central bank governor under the previous government.While Mr. Wathra acknowledges that the previous government is at fault for the ballooning national debt, he says Mr. Khan should have taken the overwhelming advice from economists to go to the I.M.F. as soon as possible.This week, the Pakistani rupee fell as low as 137 to the United States dollar, shedding 10.2 percent of its value. The biggest ever one-day fall was in 1998, when the rupee fell 11 percent after Pakistan tested nuclear weapons.Pakistan\u2019s business community, and even ardent supporters of Mr. Khan\u2019s party, have also been angry at what many described as \u201cdithering\u201d ahead of the decision to go to the I.M.F.Farooq Sarwar, a Rawalpindi-based importer of food, toiletries and confectionary items, has said he has had to cut down on his stock, worried stores he supplies will close down as customers cut their spending as the rupee falls in value.\u201cThe dip in the dollar has affected the importers in a way that no one knows what to do right now,\u201d Mr. Sarwar said. \u201cWe had high expectations from the current government and thought they will take steps after taking people in to confidence. But it seems they had done no homework.\u201dSalman Masood contributed reporting from Islamabad, Pakistan, and Alexandra Stevenson from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Adelsons Give at Least $25 Million More to G.O.P. for Midterms", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe newest donations, made recently to a pair of Republican \u201csuper PACs\u201d that are defending the party\u2019s fragile majorities in the House and the Senate, have totaled at least $25 million \u2014 and possibly more \u2014 according to two of the people, who insisted on anonymity to disclose private financial dealings.Arriving in the final few weeks before an election, that kind of money can pay for television advertising and get-out-the-vote operations that have the potential to tip the closest races. At the very least, it will help narrow the financial disparity that has given the Democratic Party an advantage. And it could not come at a more urgent time for Republicans.A half-dozen Republican strategists working on races across the country this week said that they had noticed a consistent uptick in their candidates\u2019 poll numbers in their most recent surveys, most notably in several of the tightest Senate races. Speaking anonymously to divulge private campaign data, they all said the best-case situation was that they were seeing the kind of consolidation among Republican-leaning voters that has eluded the party for most of the year.That movement, which they attribute to the unifying effect of the confirmation fight over Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, has been occurring in states where the Democrat had been either tied with or ahead of the Republican \u2014 including Arizona, Missouri, Montana, Nevada and West Virginia.Still, this last-minute infusion of cash from the Adelsons to the Congressional Leadership Fund and the Senate Leadership Fund, both of which have close ties to party leaders in Congress, is not a panacea. President Trump\u2019s unpopularity is a drag on Republican candidates in many of the most competitive House districts, especially those with more affluent and well-educated electorates. And advertising rates have been skyrocketing in the final weeks before Election Day, meaning that $20 million can buy only a fraction of what it could have a few months ago when the Adelsons gave their initial donations.In many of the most competitive House and Senate races, Democrats have already been outspending Republicans. With help from billionaires like Tom Steyer, who according to the most recent campaign filings has given $42 million to federal candidates, and Michael R. Bloomberg, who has pledged to spend $100 million on House and Senate races this year, Democrats are in a healthy financial position.A representative for the Adelsons did not respond to requests for comment. The Congressional Leadership Fund and the Senate Leadership Fund declined to comment on the donations, which were first reported by Politico.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Gillibrand\u2019s (Lack of) Spending in 2018 Offers Hints of 2020", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCONCORD, N.H. \u2014 The last time that Senator Kirsten Gillibrand was on the ballot for re-election, she poured $8 million into a summer television-advertising spree en route to a landslide victory.This year, she has invested zero dollars on television and has spent only a fraction of what she did in 2012. Ms. Gillibrand, a Democrat from New York, has instead methodically conserved her campaign cash, building a $10.7 million federal treasury that is among the largest in the country; a war chest that she could use to jump-start a bid for the White House in 2020.The lack of spending is just one sign of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s possible trajectory: On Thursday, she stumped in New Hampshire to rally support for Molly Kelly, the Democratic candidate for governor in one of the first two states that will kick off the presidential nominating contest.Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s visit followed recent appearances in Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania where she also campaigned primarily for female candidates ahead of the November elections. She has so far essentially ignored her own Republican challenger, Chele Farley, a finance executive and first-time candidate.But perhaps even more so than her multistate campaign stops, it is Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s management of her Senate campaign account that reveals the arc of her ambition. As of the end of September, she had accumulated $1 million more than she had at the beginning of the year. Candidates seeking re-election typically spend down their treasury, not grow it.\u201cI don\u2019t feel I need to spend that money in that way right now because of the type of campaign we\u2019re running,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said in an interview in New Hampshire. She framed her frugality as a sign of a modernity \u2014 a campaign focused on grass-roots and online organizing \u2014 while insisting that she is \u201csolely focused\u201d on her re-election.\u201cI want to be senator for the next six years,\u201d she said.Much of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s spending has been on the kind of list-building activities that are as likely to pay dividends in 2020 as this fall, investing heavily in digital advertising that cultivates new email addresses and donors. More than 40 percent of her spending in 2018 has been on Facebook advertising, according to an analysis of records from the Federal Election Commission and Pathmatics, an ad tracking firm.Ms. Gillibrand is not the only possible Democratic presidential contender spending judiciously on her 2018 re-election. In Massachusetts, Senator Elizabeth Warren ended September with $15 million in the bank; like Ms. Gillibrand, she has $1 million more than she had at the end of 2017. Ms. Warren raised $3.5 million in the most recent quarter and spent $4 million; Ms. Gillibrand raised and spent $1.4 million.Ms. Warren and Ms. Gillibrand are sitting atop the most money among would-be 2020 Democratic candidates (Beto O\u2019Rourke, the fund-raising phenomenon and Texas Senate candidate, is expected to empty his current $22 million campaign chest in his uphill bid to unseat Senator Ted Cruz).While presidential campaigns are big-money ventures, the so-called hard dollars that candidates directly control are often in exceedingly short supply, especially in sprawling, multicandidate fields as 2020 is expected to be for Democrats.Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s $10.7 million in the bank is about as much as Senator Rand Paul, a Republican, raised during his entire 2016 presidential campaign, and far more than Gov. Scott Walker, Senator Lindsey Graham or Mike Huckabee, all Republicans, was able to collect.\u201cPeople are wise to try to raise early and preserve as much as possible,\u201d said Danny Diaz, who was the campaign manager for Jeb Bush\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, which eventually ran short of donors and had to make cutbacks. Of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s $10 million and Ms. Warren\u2019s $15 million, Mr. Diaz said: \u201cThat\u2019s not nothing. That\u2019s the seed money starting a campaign.\u201dMs. Farley, who has raised $1.2 million over all and had $152,000 remaining at the start of this month, has tried to make Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s 2020 plans an issue. \u201cShe\u2019s focusing on issues that are relevant for running for president,\u201d Ms. Farley said in an interview, adding, \u201cI\u2019m only interested in representing the people of New York.\u201dOn Sunday, Ms. Gillibrand and Ms. Farley had been scheduled for their lone debate, but Ms. Gillibrand withdrew late Friday after labor leaders called for a boycott of the media sponsor. She said she was seeking an alternate sponsor or date before the election, though Ms. Farley said she had \u201cchickened out.\u201dPolls show Ms. Gillibrand far ahead. But Ms. Gillibrand was a heavy front-runner in 2012, too, when she dispatched her opponent, Wendy Long, claiming more than 72 percent of the vote to win her first full term. She had won her first election in 2010 to finish the term of Hillary Clinton, after being appointed to replace Ms. Clinton in 2009.In 2012, Ms. Gillibrand spent $9.3 million in the third quarter, compared with $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2018, Federal Election Commission records show.\u201cI promise no voter in New York is saying, \u2018I wish more campaign ads were on the air,\u2019\u201d said Glen Caplin, an adviser to Ms. Gillibrand, adding that the campaign was continuously evaluating the state of the race. Her campaign has taped a television ad in case it is needed.\u201cWe\u2019re trying to do it a little differently,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand explained. \u201cWhat that looks like is I\u2019ve done 16 town halls; I\u2019ve been to all 62 counties; I\u2019m trying to really create a grass-roots-oriented campaign and a modern campaign.\u201dSome of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s limited spending has been geared to an audience far beyond New York.In recent weeks, she has bought Facebook ads nationally to raise money for Democratic senators and Senate candidates, including Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona, Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Jacky Rosen in Nevada. (Donations are split between Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s campaign and the candidates, while her campaign harvests valuable new donor contacts.)She is running other ad programs to expand her database of supporters: In late September, a series of Facebook ads, which also ran nationally, featured a one-question survey: \u201cDo you approve of President Trump?\u201d Pathmatics said she spent $183,000 on one such ad.Senator Bernie Sanders, who is also on the ballot this year, spent only 1 percent for ads in his home state, Vermont, the study showed. The heavily favored Mr. Sanders has also spent little on his re-election, ending September with $8.8 million in his campaign account, though he is not expected to face the same financial pressures as other candidates if he runs again for president, because he already has an expansive donor base. His 2016 campaign was powered by more than $230 million in mostly small contributions.Ms. Gillibrand, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders would all enjoy one other financial advantage if they run right after getting re-elected: Not only can they transfer everything left over from their Senate campaign to a presidential committee, they can also tap again every past donor, even those who have given the legal maximum of $5,400 in the 2018 cycle, because it would be a new campaign.Ms. Gillibrand remains far lesser known than either of her Senate colleagues. At a phone bank in Concord, N.H., some volunteers knew her enough to rattle off her advocacy against sexual assault in the military. But others had only seen her for the first time on television contesting the confirmation of Justice Brett M.

That is partly because tools to make ads for \u201cStories\u201d are not fully developed yet, and it is easy for users to ignore ads on the service or skip the service altogether, analysts said.The company will also continue to invest in solving problems relating to issues such as misinformation and user privacy.Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that the move would hurt financial growth. \u201cWe have great products people love, but it will take us some time to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cOur revenue growth will be slower.\u201dSome people still see light at the end of the tunnel, however:\u201cRight now, G.E. is in a real trough, and it looks like the business is collapsing,\u201d said Richard Keck, president of the Keck Group International, a power plant consultant. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t panic, it will come back.\u201d\u201cBy 2022,\u201d he added, \u201cwhoever is leading the G.E. power business might well be a hero.\u201dThe shipping company said yesterday that it had shut down a discount program for members of the National Rifle Association.

{"Headline": "At George Soros\u2019s Home, Pipe Bomb Was Likely Hand-Delivered, Officials Say", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFederal authorities believe that an explosive device found Monday in a mailbox at the home of George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist who has been a focus of right-wing vitriol and conspiracy theorists, was left there by someone and was not delivered by the Postal Service, several law enforcement officials said Tuesday.Mr. Soros\u2019s home is in a suburb of New York City. The device was constructed from a length of pipe about six inches long filled with explosive powder, and it was \u201cproactively detonated\u201d by bomb squad technicians, according to one of the officials, all of whom were briefed on the investigation.The motive of the would-be bomber or bombers remained unclear, one of the officials said, adding that there had not yet been any claim of responsibility.Mr. Soros was not home when the device was discovered by a caretaker, another one of the officials said. It was rigged with a detonator, and it could have maimed or possibly killed someone had it exploded near them.A senior law enforcement official described the pipe bomb as \u201csmaller than what we typically see.\u201dThe investigation is being conducted by the New York offices of the F.B.I. and the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, according to several of the officials, all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.Officers from the police department in the town of Bedford, N.Y., initially responded to the Soros home in the hamlet of Katonah, at about 3:45 p.m. Monday in response to a call from the caretaker about a suspicious package, according to a police department statement. The Westchester County Police Department\u2019s bomb squad was called, as were federal and state investigators.\u201cThe caretaker went out to collect the mail and didn\u2019t make it back to the residence,\u201d a senior law enforcement official said. The device was packed in an envelope that was about 8 by 10 inches and \u201clooked suspicious.\u201d The caretaker \u201cdropped it in the woods on the way back to the residence.\u201dAnother official said investigators had photographed the package before detonating the device. The images have been reviewed by United States postal inspectors, the official said, who concluded that the markings on the envelope were likely intended to make it appear as though the package was sent through the mail, though they believed it was not.The inspectors, the official said, also interviewed the mail carrier on that route, who did not recall delivering such a package.Two F.B.I. Joint Terrorism Task Force squads that handle domestic terrorism cases were involved in the investigation, one of the officials said, identifying them as a unit based in the bureau\u2019s office in nearby Rye, N.Y., and another in Manhattan that has several agents trained in investigating explosives.Agents were examining recordings from surveillance cameras in the area around the Soros home to determine whether they captured images of the person leaving the device in the mailbox, or approaching or leaving, one of the officials said.He became a major political donor in the United States during George W.

{"Headline": "Campaign Contribution Raises Concerns About China\u2019s Meddling in New Zealand", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 The two politicians started their conversation casually, but there was serious business at hand: a donation recently deposited into a party account from a wealthy businessman, which one of the lawmakers said totaled 100,000 New Zealand dollars.The reported size of the donation, about $66,000, was large by New Zealand standards. But the cash, the lawmaker says, came with strings attached \u2014 a promise to add the names of two businessmen to a list of candidates for Parliament \u2014 and a plan to disguise the identity of the donor, a man with deep pockets and well-documented connections to the Chinese Communist Party.Analysts and allies fear that China can buy influence on the cheap and without raising alarms in New Zealand\u2019s political system, which they say has weak rules about lobbying, by channeling money through small, anonymous donations.Political donations, said Miguel Martin, a commentator who writes about China under the pseudonym Jichang Lulu, are an expedient way for the Communist Party to acquire \u201can avenue of influence on that country\u2019s policy.\u201dOthers said politicians at the local and national levels and from every party are desperate for funding, and therefore potentially easy prey.\u201cThere\u2019s kind of a \u2018let the good times roll\u2019 aspect with politicians in New Zealand, where historically money has been hard to come by and parties \u2014 by global standards \u2014 don\u2019t have much of a budget at all,\u201d said Rodney Jones, a New Zealand economist based in Beijing.While contributions made directly from foreigners could raise red flags, Mr. Jones said, donations from some wealthy, Chinese-born New Zealanders with connections to the Chinese Communist Party are delivered to politicians \u201con a platter.\u201d It is in the politicians\u2019 self-interest, he added, not to ask any too many questions about where the money originated.Jami Lee Ross, a member of the center-right National Party, accused the party\u2019s leader, Simon Bridges, of fraud by trying to disguise a 100,000 New Zealand dollar donation as smaller, anonymous donations.By law, the identities of contributors who donate less than 15,000 New Zealand dollars are allowed to remain anonymous.The National Party has said it did nothing illegal, but has yet to explain how the donation discussed in the call was handled.The mention of Mr. Zhang piqued the interest of China analysts, who said the businessman had known ties to the Chinese Communist Party.Mr. Zhang served in the People\u2019s Liberation Army and headed a provincial consultative group for the Communist Party before emigrating to New Zealand in 2000. His \u201centire life is in the shadow of the Communist Party,\u201d said Chen Weijian, a member of the pro-democracy group New Zealand Values Alliance.Mr. Zhang is chairman of the influential Chao Shan General Association of New Zealand, an organization started in 2014 for New Zealanders born in the Chinese town of Chaosan, but which has become an important intermediary between China and New Zealand. He plans to host 1,000 Chinese visitors at a business conference next year in Auckland, the country\u2019s largest city.Mr. Zhang\u2019s \u201cpositions and relationships\u201d gave the Chinese Communist Party \u201cleverage enabling it to \u2018guide\u2019 or simply expect individuals like Zhang to be aligned with the CCP\u2019s policy goals,\u201d said Mr. Martin.Mr. Zhang has appeared in news photographs with both opposition lawmakers and those in the government, including Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.Mr. Zhang has also attended a fund-raising auction for Phil Goff, the mayor of Auckland, and is currently traveling in China with another New Zealand mayor.It is Mr. Zhang\u2019s second trip to China with that mayor, Gary Tong of Southland.Representatives for both the Labour and National parties did not respond to questions about whether they intended to investigate the foreign political connections of their donors, and the law does not require them to do so.While politicians cannot accept large donations from foreigners, some analysts said lawmakers should be more savvy about where their money comes from.In the leaked recording between the two lawmakers, Mr. Ross reminds Mr. Bridges that he had also discussed with Mr. Zhang a potential political \u201ccandidacy\u201d for two of his New Zealand-Chinese business associates. In New Zealand, some lawmakers campaign for seats representing a local constituency, while others are selected for Parliament by their political parties, and do not have to run for office.\u201cTwo MPs, yeah,\u201d Mr. Bridges can be heard responding, in a reference to members of Parliament. Mr. Bridges said last week that he had not been promising candidates for cash.China is New Zealand\u2019s biggest trading partner and New Zealand is hoping to expand a free-trade agreement signed in 2008.Mr. Ross, the lawmaker who released the recorded call, both resigned and was expelled from the National party last Tuesday, but maintained on Friday that he would remain in Parliament as New Zealand\u2019s only independent lawmaker.Advertisement"}

Warner of Virginia was rolling to victory and gave $500,000 to the party committee in a year when they picked up eight seats.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Yet other Democrats are quick to note that party candidates who are running more cautious and centrist campaigns in conservative states are faring no better than the liberal Mr. O\u2019Rourke. In Tennessee former Gov. Phil Bredesen, the Democratic nominee for the Senate, came out in support of Justice Kavanaugh but has seen his standing in the polls plummet.And, these Democrats say, Washington-based strategists are in denial about both why Mr. O\u2019Rourke has raised so much money and what it says about the party\u2019s fund-raising culture. Mr. O\u2019Rourke has harnessed social media to viral effect, live-streaming much of his waking life, from rallies to burger runs.\u201cPeople will, because of the internet and because of how people now access information, donate to any candidates and causes that inspire them most,\u201d said Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama who has been an outspoken supporter of Mr. O\u2019Rourke. \u201cThe idea that there is some entity in D.C. that can direct the fund-raising for how people give is thinking that is so 10, 20 years ago.\u201d\u201cClearly he\u2019s not running for the United States Senate from Texas,\u201d Senator John Cornyn of Texas said Friday on Laura Ingraham\u2019s talk radio show, adding: \u201cMy only suspicion, Laura, is he\u2019s running for the Democratic nomination for president in 2020.\u201dTexas has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1976, and has not voted for any Democrat to statewide office since 1994.Mr. O\u2019Rourke has denied any interest. \u201cOh, no, I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d he said in an interview in August. \u201cNo.\u201d On Friday, Mr. O\u2019Rourke and his campaign did not respond to text messages about whether he would transfer any of his fund-raising haul and if he was committed to spending all his money raised on this race.Even Texas Republicans seemed comfortable with the idea that Democrats were plowing so much money into the state.\u201cI\u2019m delighted they\u2019re wasting their money here,\u201d said Matt Mackowiak, the chairman of the Travis County Republican Party. \u201cTake $30 million of that and the Democrats could have won the Senate.\u201dHalf of the poll\u2019s respondents said they approved of the job Mr. Trump was doing in office, and a slight majority said they would like to see Republicans retain control of the Senate in November.As with many races throughout the country this year, the gender gap in Texas appears stark. The candidates are effectively tied among female voters, according to the poll, but Mr. Cruz holds a lead of more than 15 points with men. He also leads decisively with voters over 45.Mr. O\u2019Rourke has staked his campaign on an ability to make inroads with new kinds of voters. He boasts of traveling to all 254 Texas counties, even those so red \u201cyou can see them glowing from outer space,\u201d and is trying to turn out key groups, particularly young and nonwhite voters, whose participation in the midterms tends to lag.Among Hispanic voters in the poll, Mr. O\u2019Rourke leads 56 percent to 37 percent \u2014 a clear advantage, but one that might be insufficient with a group that Democrats have hoped would support their candidate in even greater numbers. Mr. O\u2019Rourke, a fluent Spanish speaker, has frequently highlighted the plight of immigrants under Mr. Trump, holding up the administration\u2019s family separation policies at the border as a moral stain.Even many of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s supporters have long understood the odds. In a follow-up interview after being contacted for the Upshot-Siena poll, John Saylor, 61, of Muleshoe, Tex., commended Mr. O\u2019Rourke for being \u201cout with the people,\u201d but he acknowledged the challenges facing his candidate.\u201cBeto is running a great campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is Texas.\u201dLiam Stack contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Mr. Trump called the sketch \u201ca total con job,\u201d depicting \u201ca nonexistent man.\u201dIn its decision, the court sided with Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers\u2019 argument that the tweet included an opinion, which the president was free to express.\u201cThe court agrees with Mr. Trump\u2019s argument because the tweet in question constitutes \u2018rhetorical hyperbole\u2019 normally associated with politics and public discourse in the United States,\u201d Judge S.

While Charles J. Harder, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said Monday that the fees had yet to be determined, the case required several lawyers and multiple court filings. At least four lawyers represented the president at a recent court hearing in Los Angeles, and one filing drew on research that cited more than three dozen cases as precedent.In a statement on Monday, Mr. Harder, the lawyer for the president, said, \u201cNo amount of spin or commentary by Stormy Daniels or her lawyer, Mr. Avenatti, can truthfully characterize today\u2019s ruling in any way other than total victory for President Trump and total defeat for Stormy Daniels.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Though sent to jail on charges that he had been involved in the murder of at least 25 people during those years, Mr. Fujimori remained deeply popular among many Peruvians as his administration was also credited with improving the economy, investing in infrastructure and defeating left-wing groups that engaged in bloody conflict with the government.Ms. Fujimori has become one of Peru\u2019s most powerful politicians, commanding the Popular Force party, which controls the largest share of seats in the country\u2019s Congress. Many analysts feared that her rise \u2014 which included an attempt to impeach Peru\u2019s previous president, who eventually resigned \u2014 would do lasting damage to the country\u2019s democratic institutions.The recent detentions of Ms. Fujimori and her father have now led some to believe that the opposite may be true.\u201cI think it\u2019s a major point of weakening for Fujimorismo,\u201d said Eduardo Dargent, a political scientist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, referring to the political movement that bears the family name.Ms. Fujimori has been the subject of a number of corruption investigations in recent years, including inquiries into her campaign financing, accusations of money laundering and questions regarding her ties to the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht, which has admitted paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes for construction projects in Latin America.Public anger turned against both Ms. Fujimori and investigators this July, when tapes in which judicial officials could be heard planning unofficial meetings with a \u201cSe\u00f1ora K\u201d were leaked to the press. Critics said that the nickname referred to Ms. Fujimori and that the officials were looking to cut an illicit deal with her. The ensuing scandal resulted in the firing and resignation of many top judiciary officials.Mr. Dargent, the political scientist, said prosecutors were now under increased pressure to show that they are clean of political influence \u2014 a possible motivation for Wednesday\u2019s arrest.There have been other signs of weakness within Ms. Fujimori\u2019s party, and within the family, in recent months.

Over a decade, Bankia\u2019s executives unlawfully used the company\u2019s credit cards to make purchases totaling 12.5 million euros.The imprisonment will mark another chapter in the long-running case of Bankia and its mismanagement. Mr. Rato, a former finance minister of Spain, who was once seen as a potential prime minister, is the most prominent Spaniard to enter prison since the country was plunged into a European banking bailout by Bankia\u2019s near-collapse.This week, Spain\u2019s national court rejected Mr. Rato\u2019s appeal to have the prison term suspended while he tries to file a final appeal before the constitutional court. Instead, the national court set Thursday as the deadline for Mr. Rato to enter prison of his own accord.Mr. Rato and other former Bankia executives are still awaiting a ruling in another, broader case centered on their mismanagement of Bankia. In that case, they stand accused of misrepresenting the bank\u2019s financial soundness as it was preparing a public stock offering in 2011.Bankia went on to report a loss for 2012 of \u20ac19.2 billion, then the largest in Spanish corporate history. Separately, Mr. Rato has also been investigated for tax evasion relating to property purchases, including that of a hotel in Berlin.Mr. Rato was the finance minister in the conservative government of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, which was in office from 1996 to 2004. He then led the I.M.F. from 2004 to 2007, winning the job thanks to his reputation as the architect of Spain\u2019s construction-led boom.After Bankia\u2019s bailout, the focus shifted to the courtrooms. In 2014, Mr. Rato and others were ordered to stand trial for misusing their credit-card privileges while also providing dozens of members of the board and their well-connected friends with unauthorized company credit cards that were issued separately from their normal remuneration packages. The cards were used for personal purchases, like clothing, restaurant meals and travel, as well as cash withdrawals.The prosecution accused Mr. Rato of making illegal personal purchases while running Bankia worth \u20ac54,800.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Vilification of George Soros Moved From the Fringes to the Mainstream", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn both sides of the Atlantic, a loose network of activists and political figures on the right have spent years seeking to cast Mr. Soros not just as a well-heeled political opponent but also as the personification of all they detest. Employing barely coded anti-Semitism, they have built a warped portrayal of him as the mastermind of a \u201cglobalist\u201d movement, a left-wing radical who would undermine the established order and a proponent of diluting the white, Christian nature of their societies through immigration.In the process, they have pushed their version of Mr. Soros, 88, from the dark corners of the internet and talk radio to the very center of the political debate.\u201cI only hope one day I\u2019m as effective as he has been \u2014 and as vilified,\u201d Mr. Bannon said, calling threats like the pipe bomb \u201cthe admission ticket for playing in this arena.\u201dOn Fox News, in Republican fund-raising appeals and in research by conservative advocacy groups, his name is invoked as an all-purpose symbol of liberalism run amok.In Europe, the effort to demonize him has been both fueled and harnessed by nationalist leaders like Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary and politicians in formerly communist countries like Macedonia, Albania and Russia.\u201cHe\u2019s a banker, he\u2019s Jewish, he gives to Democrats \u2014 he\u2019s sort of a perfect storm for vilification by the right, here and in Europe,\u201d said Michael H. Posner, a human rights lawyer and former State Department official in the Obama administration.Mr. Soros has given his main group, the Open Society Foundations, $32 billion for what it calls democracy-building efforts in the United States and around the world. In addition, in the United States, Mr. Soros has personally contributed more than $75 million over the years to federal candidates and committees, according to Federal Election Commission and Internal Revenue Service records.That qualifies him as one of the top disclosed donors to American political campaigns in the modern campaign finance era, and it does not include the many millions more he has donated to political nonprofit groups that do not disclose their donors.Mr. Soros initially focused his activism on nurturing the democracies that emerged from the dissolution of the Soviet Union. But as he has evolved in the United States into a more traditional political operator, conservatives have become increasingly driven to discredit him \u2014 and, in turn, to use him to discredit the candidates and causes he supports \u2014 sometimes by exaggerating or mischaracterizing his role in actions taken by groups he helps to fund, and sometimes with imagery widely seen as anti-Semitic.The closing advertisement for Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign featured Mr. Soros \u2014 as well as Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve at the time, and Lloyd Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, both of whom are Jewish \u2014 as examples of \u201cglobal special interests\u201d who enriched themselves on the backs of working Americans.If anything, Mr. Soros has been elevated by Mr. Trump and his allies to even greater prominence in the narrative they have constructed for the closing weeks of the 2018 midterm elections. They have projected on to him key roles in both the threat they say is posed by the Central Americans making their way toward the United States border and what they characterized as Democratic \u201cmobs\u201d protesting the nomination of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Mr. Soros\u2019s attackers in the United States and in Europe have increasingly found common cause in recent years.Judicial Watch\u2019s efforts pick up a theme pushed by Republican members of Congress in letters to the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development this year accusing Mr. Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations of using taxpayer funding to push a liberal agenda in Albania, Colombia, Macedonia and Romania. A spokeswoman for the Soros group said the programs in question focus on issues that are consistent with \u201cAmerican ideals,\u201d like fighting corruption and promoting the rule of law.Mr. Soros was born into a Jewish family in Hungary, and survived the Nazi occupation as a child in part by posing as the Christian godson of a government official.His daring investments in companies and currencies proved hugely lucrative, prompting The Economist to call him \u201csurely the world\u2019s most intriguing investor\u201d in 1987. His decision to short the British pound in 1992 earned his funds a reported profit of $1 billion.By then, he was turning his attention to democracy-building in Eastern Europe.Mr. Soros and his foundations supported groups and individuals seeking to bring down Communism, including the Solidarity and Charter 77 movements in Poland and Czechoslovakia. The leaders of both groups would later lead their countries in the post-Communist era.In Hungary, Mr. Soros distributed photocopiers to universities and libraries as a means to fight government censorship, and he paid for dissidents to study in the West. The recipients included a young Mr. Orban, then a liberal activist.After the end of the Cold War, with the Open Society Foundations as his main vehicle, Mr. Soros funded new work for destitute Soviet scientists in Russia, paid for free school breakfasts for Hungarian children and set up a college, the Central European University, that later drew the ire of Mr. Orban\u2019s government.In the United States, where Mr. Soros was granted citizenship in the 1960s, Mr. Soros\u2019s efforts often won bipartisan applause. A professed admirer of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s efforts to topple Communist rule in Eastern Europe, Mr. Soros, who at the time described himself as a political independent, was seen by anti-Communist Republicans as a fellow freedom fighter.Mr. Soros first became a major target for Republicans when he donated $27 million in the 2004 election cycle to an effort to defeat President George W. Bush, whose administration Mr. Soros condemned for rushing to war in Iraq and compared to Hitler\u2019s Nazi regime.\u201cBut it started coming back with a vengeance during the 2016 campaign,\u201d said Mr. Brock, whose groups have received millions of dollars from Mr. Soros.During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Soros had expressed even greater alarm about Mr. Trump than he had about Mr. Bush, and he donated more than $16 million to groups supporting Hillary Clinton.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.Mr. Soros, his allies say, interprets the attacks from Mr. Trump, Mr. Orban and their supporters as an effort to intimidate him into backing down. But the intimidation has backfired, they say.When friends reached out to express concern for his safety after the pipe bomb news broke, Mr. Soros, who was not there when the package was delivered, changed the subject to what he called \u201cthe damage\u201d being done by the Trump administration, said his political adviser, Michael Vachon.In an email to The New York Times, Mr. Soros said he was grieving for the victims of the Pittsburgh shooting and their families. He added: \u201cI came to this country to find refuge. I am deeply distressed that in America in 2018 Jews are being massacred just because they are Jewish.\u201dMr. Soros has donated more than $15 million in this election cycle to support Democratic candidates at the federal level, according to election commission records, and he has also donated to nonprofits that do not disclose their donors.The very scale of his activities has given Republicans an opening to portray him as a nefarious driving force behind divisive political conflicts.At the same time, his network of European nonprofit groups was increasingly making him a target of authoritarian leaders, including President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Mr. Orban in Hungary.In a campaign this year, Mr. Orban\u2019s party ran an advertisement that depicted a smiling Mr. Soros, overlaid with the slogan: \u201cLet\u2019s not let George Soros have the last laugh.\u201d Critics argued that the image was meant to remind viewers of the \u201cLaughing Jew,\u201d a common anti-Semitic trope.Kenneth P. Vogel and Scott Shane reported from Washington, and Patrick Kingsley from Berlin.Advertisement"}

Her office declined an interview request, would not share her schedule of campaign events or suggest surrogates to discuss her record.On her issues with the F.E.C., her campaign said \u201cWe have engaged a new compliance team, including a new treasurer, and taken other corrective actions.\u201dHundreds of thousands of dollars once flowed to firms connected to her daughter and son-in-law \u2014 the main one listed their home as its address.

Under federal election law, campaigns and political action committees are not allowed to coordinate activities.Ms. Blackburn\u2019s campaign said Mr. Ketchel \u201chasn\u2019t been a registered lobbyist in 10 years.\u201dIn recent years, Mr. Ketchel co-founded a health care company called MDSave that has lobbied the House, a review of public records shows. The campaign said that his firm has not lobbied Ms. Blackburn, who sits on a health care subcommittee.\u201cBlackburn wants to make it a national contest all about Trump, and Bredesen wants to make it about local issues,\u201d said John G. Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt. \u201cBlackburn is running overall the more negative campaign, trying to raise doubts about Bredesen, much more than Bredesen is trying to raise doubts about her,\u201d he added.\u201cHe wants to paint himself as a problem solver, and he has an advantage when he\u2019s doing that, because that\u2019s what he did as governor.\u201dPolls show the race as a virtual toss up, with a slight edge to Mr. Bredesen.Asked about the legislation, Ms. Blackburn, in her statement, said: \u201cI recently introduced bipartisan bills to increase civil and criminal penalties for bad actors\u201d and that she would \u201ccontinue to work toward a systemic solution\u201d to the opioid crisis.The two candidates have clashed over the nomination of Brett M.

Ms. Blackburn called the inquiry into assault allegations made against Judge Kavanaugh \u201ccharacter assassination.\u2019\u2019 Mr. Bredesen chided Ms. Blackburn and senators on all sides for rushing to judgment before Judge Kavanaugh and his accuser had even been heard.In some ways, Mr. Bredesen better fits the profile of a Republican candidate. He was a wealthy entrepreneur by the time he was elected Nashville\u2019s mayor in 1991, having started and sold a health maintenance organization called HealthAmerica, Inc. Mr. Bredesen, who did not collect a salary as governor, continues to have an entrepreneurial bent and a cautious view of regulation. Mr. Corker, often a Republican antagonist of President Trump, has called Mr. Bredesen a friend and declined to campaign against him.Mr. Bredesen likes to turn down the political temperature, declaring at a recent policy forum in Memphis, \u201cI am not running against the president.\u201d\u201cMy role as a senator is to not to be in permanent opposition to him on every issue, but look at it through the lens of what\u2019s best for Tennessee,\u201d he said.In an interview at his campaign headquarters the day after the forum, he said he was returning to politics after more than seven years because he feels he gives his party its best shot to win.\u201cI don\u2019t think a generic Democrat, well qualified, is going to win that seat,\u201d he said. \u201cI was in kind of a unique position of having been governor, had a base and so on, and I guess I just felt an obligation to step up.\u2019\u2019As governor, he stuck to the center. Saddled with skyrocketing costs from a prototype of Obamacare called TennCare, he made steep cuts.He also opposed the state income tax and lowered fees for trial attorneys, said Victor Ashe, a Republican who served for 16 years as mayor of Knoxville, adding that \u201cthe joke was he was the best Republican governor Tennessee had ever had.\u201dStephanie Saul contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Mr. Nesbit is the author of the new book, \u201cThis is the Way the World Ends.\u201dAs climate change begins to make water scarcity a critical security issue globally, wealthier countries have begun to look outside their borders to meet their water needs. In moves that have important trade and geopolitical implications, Saudi Arabia and China have come to America to help solve their water problems and feed their people.The country, rich from its vast oil deposits, has one of the world\u2019s smallest water reserves. Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t have a single lake or river. For thousands of years, the Saudis have depended on wells or the occasional oasis. Infrequent rainfalls replenish shallow aquifers 150 feet or so underground. Wells dug ten times as deep as those shallow aquifers tap into reserves not renewed by rainfall. Once used up, they\u2019re gone.But it wasn\u2019t enough. So they turned to the United States and other places rich in water.And water is becoming more precious in some regions of China. Water tables are dropping precipitously in northern China, up to 10 feet a year in some areas there. Drifting sands are covering hundreds of miles of potential cropland south of the Gobi Desert in northern China. The country\u2019s plans to divert water from rivers in southern China are running into regional politics, while rivers and streams in the north are still quite costly to clean up.

{"Headline": "Why New York City Hired Someone to Improve Democracy", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMayor Bill de Blasio has created a new city position to encourage New Yorkers to vote and to increase civic participation. Everyone \u2014 well, not really everyone \u2014 talks about improving the state of democracy, but few people do much to make it happen.Mayor Bill de Blasio is trying to be an exception. In his State of the City speech in February, the mayor made the project of improving democracy in New York City the centerpiece of his second term, and to do so, he said he would create a new job: chief democracy officer. This week Mr. de Blasio finally filled that post, announcing on Tuesday that he had hired a Harvard-educated lawyer, Ayirini Fonseca-Sabune. Her challenge: improve the low voter participation in New York, which reflects a broader malaise nationwide.A City Hall news release sent out on Tuesday said that Ms. Fonseca-Sabune \u201cwill be responsible for amplifying the voice of every New Yorker by engaging people from across all demographics.\u201d The job, it said, involves \u201cdeveloping robust voter registration drives,\u201d working with schools to improve civics lessons and \u201cengaging local and national partners to develop new ways to engage people civically.\u201d That\u2019s a lot of engaging.Oddly, the release did not mention the one thing that Mr. de Blasio said in his State of the City speech that the chief democracy officer would do. \u201cWhoever will take this job will end up being responsible for registering 1.5 million New Yorkers in the next four years,\u201d he said in February. Ms. Fonseca-Sabune now has just over three years to meet the mayor\u2019s goal. Ms. Fonseca-Sabune said that she started work on Monday, and does not yet know how she intends to meet the specific mandate. She said that City Hall officials have been working since February to come up with a plan. \u201cWhat I bring to it is really being out in the community, figuring out why people don\u2019t vote, supporting them, figuring out how to engage with them and making it easier to vote in New York,\u201d she said. Ms. Fonseca-Sabune said that when she discussed the job with Mr. de Blasio they talked about how to \u201ccreate structures so people can really engage day in and day out, year in and year out, not just in an exciting election year or in the presidential election. We vote in this city every year and having people really feel engaged every year.\u201dBut she has skipped several primary elections. Records provided by the state and city Boards of Elections show that Ms. Fonseca-Sabune did not vote in the Sept. 12, 2017, primary, when Mr. de Blasio ran against little opposition for the Democratic Party nomination on his way to re-election. She skipped primaries in June 2016 (Congress) and September 2016 (State Assembly), and again in September 2014, including the primary for governor that year. In 2013, the records show, she voted in the citywide primary in September (which Mr. de Blasio won) and again in the Oct. 1 runoff for public advocate. And in April 2014, she voted in the presidential primary, when Hillary Clinton ran against Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination. \u201cI would say I know what it\u2019s like to be a busy working parent who is trying to fit in voting with everything else going on,\u201d said Ms. Fonseca-Sabune, who has a son born in 2015. She said that she would have to consult her personal calendars to verify whether or not she voted in a given election, and suggested that her occasional failure to vote added to her qualifications for the job. \u201cI\u2019m the perfect person to do this work,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I understand exactly what those challenges are.\u201dMs. Fonseca-Sabune, 36, who goes by Rini, was born in New York and grew up in New Jersey. Her mother is an immigrant from Guyana and her father is from Uganda. She graduated as an undergraduate from Harvard and then Harvard Law School and she also has a master\u2019s degree in teaching from Fordham University. She was a law clerk for two federal judges. She taught high school at the Bushwick School for Social Justice and volunteered as a teacher to inmates at Rikers Island. She worked as an investigator for the Civilian Complaint Review Board. She taught secondary school in Uganda and worked on a community health-worker training program in Rwanda. Most recently she worked as a lawyer at the Urban Justice Center in New York, representing low-income tenants suing their landlords for harassment. \u201cI have worked hand in hand with community-based organizations all over the city to support community organizing campaigns\u201d as a tenant lawyer, she said. And she said that in Rwanda she helped organize the training of 1,200 community health workers across a large rural area. The job offered a salary commensurate with experience; Ms. Fonseca-Sabune will be paid $165,000 a year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Connecticut, What\u2019s Worst: Trump, Gov. Malloy or the Economy?", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARTFORD \u2014 In races for governor across the nation, the specter of President Trump looms as a beacon of divisiveness, and Connecticut is no exception.Ned Lamont, the Democratic candidate for governor, has tried to tie the Republican candidate, Bob Stefanowski, to Mr. Trump during debates, commercials and campaign mailers, including one that suggested that Mr. Stefanowski was guest starring in an episode of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d entitled, \u201cHow to run Connecticut into the ground.\u201dIn a state that has voted Democrat in the last seven presidential elections, including 2016, when Hillary Clinton drew 54.6 percent of the vote to Mr. Trump\u2019s 40.9 percent, Mr. Lamont\u2019s strategy would seem sound.Mr. Stefanowski has tried to link Mr. Malloy to Mr. Lamont, suggesting in a campaign mailer that one was a mirror image of the other, and that Mr. Lamont would raise taxes to an unconscionable level.\u201cThere is not a whole lot of connection between how we vote or feel at the presidential level and how we vote at the gubernatorial level,\u201d said Ronald Schurin, an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut. \u201cThis is the national Republicans\u2019 greatest hope of picking up a gubernatorial seat in 2018.\u201dConnecticut is a decidedly blue state: Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a ratio of 5 to 3, and Democratic candidates are favored in the state\u2019s five congressional House races and the lone Senate race, where Senator Chris Murphy is expected to easily rebuff his Republican opponent, Matthew Corey, a Navy veteran who owns a window-washing business and bar.But voters here have a penchant for alternating between the two major parties when it comes to sending a governor to the state capital.Beyond the competition between anti-Trump activism and Mr. Malloy\u2019s rock-bottom approval ratings, the other predominant campaign issue is the state\u2019s poor fiscal health; it is projected to have a budget deficit hovering north of $4 billion over the next two years.Which candidate\u2019s vision resonates with voters remains to be seen.Nonetheless, Mr. Stefanowski, 56, would seem an unusual standard-bearer for the Republican Party.During both the primary and general-election campaigns, he has faced criticism for not voting during a 16-year period. (A campaign spokesman said Mr. Stefanowski, a former executive at General Electric, UBS Investment Bank and other firms, lived and worked in London for 10 of those years.) There were also questions when, after a quarter century as a Republican, Mr. Stefanowski changed his party affiliation to Democrat for several months before switching back last year.Similarly, Mr. Lamont, a wealthy telecommunications entrepreneur of Greenwich, has not always toed the Democratic Party line.To the consternation of some party leaders, he oversaw a striking upset of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in the 2006 Democratic primary, before losing in the general election to Mr. Lieberman, who ran as an independent. He then ran for governor in 2010, but lost to Mr. Malloy in the primary. Previously, he served on the Greenwich board of selectmen for one term in the 1980s.By the Democratic primary in August, Mr. Lamont, 64, had long made amends; with his party\u2019s backing, he trounced his sole opponent, Joseph P. Ganim, the mayor of Bridgeport who had served several years in federal prison after his conviction on corruption charges.On Friday, the former vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party, came to Connecticut to stump for Mr. Lamont, as well as for a couple of other candidates.Mr. Griebel rejects the notion that he is only running as a spoiler, pointing out that, of the 2.1 million registered voters in the state, nearly 900,000 are unaffiliated. He blames the two-party system for a lack of job growth over three decades, as well as higher taxes and a dearth of investment in transportation and education.\u201cThe true \u2018spoiler\u2019 is the duopoly that cares first and foremost for its perpetuation,\u201d he said.Both Mr. Lamont and Mr. Stefanowski have eschewed the state\u2019s famously generous public financing system, which gives qualified candidates $6 million toward general-election campaigns. Mr. Lamont has contributed several million dollars to his campaign, while Mr. Stefanowski funded his primary challenge with $2.3 million of his own.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.All three candidates have refined their messages about the economy. While other states rebounded after the 2008 financial crisis, Connecticut lagged. The jobs that were eventually added back paid substantially less than the ones that were lost. Mr. Griebel wants to eliminate the \u201cbusiness entity\u201d tax, a cut that would cost $60 million in revenue but, he said, would signal a \u201cmore friendly environment for employers.\u201dHis two opponents proffer other solutions. Mr. Stefanowski would take an ax to the state\u2019s spending with an approach known as zero-base budgeting, with no sacred cows. To jump-start the economy, he would also slash taxes \u2014 eliminating estate and gift taxes immediately and phasing out both personal and corporate income taxes.After an event at a public school here, Mr. Lamont called Mr. Stefanowski\u2019s tax proposals reckless. While he plans to provide residents with some property tax relief in the form of rebate checks, he would not touch the personal income tax, which yields about $10 billion a year in state revenue.\u201cRight now, I would leave the income tax where it is,\u201d said Mr. Lamont after he appeared with Senator Murphy, visiting music and history classes at Hartford Magnet Trinity College Academy. \u201cIt\u2019s the workhorse of the budget.\u201dInstead, he would focus on economic development and job training. Mr. Lamont wants to invest in community colleges so that students learn specialized skills that businesses need. And, he said, he would finance transportation improvements throughout the state to attract new employers.Four other congressional seats, all occupied by Democrats, are also up for election. But the incumbents are facing unknown candidates, most with little or no money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla\u2019s Future Is Not Yet Secured", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFollowing the fortunes of Tesla has been a frantic, full-time job in 2018 \u2014 and that is not about to change.Tesla\u2019s stronger-than-expected third-quarter results last week relieved some of the pressure on the company and its chief executive, Elon Musk, after a turbulent few months. Mr. Musk engulfed the company in controversy after he said he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to take the company private, a statement that regulators later said was misleading and false.The automaker posted quarterly profits and positive cash flows, which helped drive its stock sharply higher. Strong sales of its latest car, the Model 3 sedan, delivered a surge in revenue. The company managed to restrain its expenses in the quarter, though that may be hard to sustain for a company that intends to expand quickly.Tesla is definitely making progress, but some fundamental questions hanging over the company remain unanswered.Tesla sold 56,065 Model 3 vehicles during the third quarter, making it one of the top selling passenger cars in the U.S. during the period.It was also one of the most expensive. Jeffrey Osborne of the financial services firm Cowen estimates that buyers on average paid $58,800 for the car in the third quarter. The price was high because Tesla is first selling the car with premium features.Unfortunately for Tesla, the demand for sedans is plunging, which may undercut one of Mr. Musk\u2019s arguments for why a large market exists for the Model 3. On Wednesday, he said the Model 3 competes well against BMW\u2019s 3 Series sedans. But sales of 3 Series cars have suffered as consumers turn to larger vehicles. Tesla may end up fighting for a share of a shrinking market.It\u2019s not so simple. The company plans to offer lower-priced Model 3s but selling them with a high price tag bolsters profitability. Tesla\u2019s gross profit on the Model 3 is around $13,000. That\u2019s important because the company needs cash to finance an increase in Model 3 production that is necessary to satisfy the surge in demand that will, in theory, materialize when Tesla offers a price cut.This could leave Tesla walking a tightrope. If demand for higher-priced Model 3s comes in below expectations, Tesla again will have to tap its pile of cash, raising concerns about its financial health.Tesla is selling a $46,000 version of the Model 3 with a less powerful battery that allows the car to be driven for 260 miles before a recharge, rather than the 310 miles possible with the higher-priced models. Tesla then plans to offer a $35,000 Model 3 in 2019.But here\u2019s the problem: The cost of making Model 3s still exceeds $35,000. On Wednesday, Mr. Musk said it was Tesla\u2019s goal to get the figure down to $30,000 or below. Tesla managed to control expenses in the third quarter, and the longer its production lines are in place, the more costs can be removed. But consistently making big efficiency gains is not easy. If Tesla struggles to produce a $35,000 Model 3, its strategy of broadening its customer base will be in doubt.It could go out and raise billions of dollars of new money in the markets. Wall Street analysts expect such deals to happen. On Wednesday, Mr. Musk sounded slightly more receptive to the idea of raising new capital.

Now He Wants to Lead Maine.", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySCARBOROUGH, Me. \u2014 Shawn Moody has made his difficult upbringing and success in business the twin pillars of his campaign to become Maine\u2019s next governor, boasting in commercials, debates and speeches about how he built his automobile repair stores from scratch after he was raised by a single mother.\u201cI would put my record up against anyone about knowing how to grow a successful business,\u201d said Mr. Moody, the Republican nominee in one of the country\u2019s most competitive races for governor.But for Jill Hayward, herself a single mother, there is nothing quite as painful as seeing Mr. Moody appear on television recounting how he overcame childhood hardship to make Moody\u2019s Collision Centers into a multi-million-dollar regional powerhouse.In 2006, Ms. Hayward, a former member of management at a Moody\u2019s store, filed a sexual discrimination complaint against Mr. Moody with the Maine Human Rights Commission, accusing him of firing her because he did not think she was up to the job after giving birth to her son. \u201cI want to see you grow,\u201d he told her, according to the previously undisclosed complaint, but with her new parental obligations, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that you can do that in this job.\u201d Mr. Moody ultimately settled the complaint and, she said, paid her around $20,000.\u201cAny time he comes on, I turn it off because it\u2019ll make me teary,\u201d Ms. Hayward said in an interview.In a separate interview, Mr. Moody repeatedly cited the settlement to indicate he was restricted from addressing Ms. Hayward\u2019s accusations.\u201cI\u2019m not going to say the details of what was finalized, but we reached an agreement,\u201d he said. \u201cThe allegation was withdrawn and it was resolved.\u201d\u201cI just have to rest on our track record, our reputation in the community,\u201d he said, arguing that he had led \u201ca very compassionate, well-run organization.\u201dMr. Moody has made his reputation and character a part of the campaign because of how much he leans on his biography in his race against Janet Mills, the Democratic state attorney general. Opinion polls show a tight contest to succeed the pugnacious term-limited governor, Paul R. LePage, whose lieutenants are guiding Mr. Moody\u2019s campaign.And to be competitive, Mr. Moody is drawing on his fortune earned from his repair stores in cities like Biddeford and Scarborough.It was in those two Portland-area Moody\u2019s shops where Ms. Hayward worked a few years after graduating from college. By her late 20s she was an expediter, spending more than two years coordinating with vendors and processing orders. Ms. Hayward said she received no written complaints from her superiors and earned a raise during her time there. (Mr. Moody would not address Ms. Hayward\u2019s work history.)It was a collegial environment and she gave as good as she got from \u201cmy boys,\u201d as she called her co-workers. They ribbed her about the oil spill pads laying around the shop, joking that she could use those in case her water broke when she was pregnant. But Ms. Hayward said her colleagues were also tender: Two of them helped build her crib, and they chipped in to get her a gift card from Wal-Mart as a baby shower gift.But shortly after she gave birth to her son, she said, Mr. Moody sent her life into a tailspin from which she only emerged after more than a decade. As Ms. Hayward sees it, he fired her because he did not think she could do the job as a single mother.Sharing her story with a reporter for the first time, Ms. Hayward, 44, said that in November 2005 Mr. Moody visited her apartment while she was on maternity leave after having an emergency C-section. As she sat feeding a bottle to her weeks-old son, her boss explained to her that she could no longer work for him because of her duties as a mother, she said.\u201cMy heart was in my throat or at my feet, and I\u2019m looking at him like, \u2018You\u2019re kidding,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Hayward, who remembered \u201cbawling\u201d as it became clear there was nothing she could say to keep her job.Mr. Moody, again citing the settlement he reached, did not directly answer when asked if he visited her at her apartment and fired her. But he said that his company had a multi-step process on terminations and that multiple people were involved in such decisions, which take place at the store where the employee in question worked.In the 2006 complaint filed to the human rights commission, and obtained by The New York Times, Ms. Hayward made the same claims she leveled in the interview and said she was replaced by a man. She accused Mr. Moody of sexual discrimination in violation of state and federal law and listed a series of comments he made upon firing her.\u201cYou are no longer going to be able to do the job in Biddeford now that you have\u201d your son, Mr. Moody told her, according to the complaint.According to publicly available documents on file with the human rights commission, which enforces Maine\u2019s anti-discrimination laws, Ms. Hayward and Mr. Moody eventually agreed to a settlement and Ms. Hayward agreed to withdraw the complaint.A former counsel for the commission, John P. Gause, said he could not speak specifically about the case. But Mr. Gause said the panel generally encouraged parties to settle disputes and avoid protracted wrangling in court.Asked why he did not fight the claim, Mr. Moody suggested he harbored some regret for not doing so.\u201cThat is a great question,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you know how proud of an individual I am about how we do treat people, you\u2019re absolutely right.\u201d But, he said, his insurance company handled his side of the case and it was \u201ckind of out of our hands.\u201dIn the interview, Ms. Hayward said Mr. Moody paid her around $20,000 as part of their settlement, $3,000 of which went to her attorney.But that was not until October 2006, nearly a year after she lost her job, Ms. Hayward recounted. She would eventually lose her apartment and her car.\u201cHow do you dispose of a single mother when that\u2019s your claim to fame in your campaign?\u201d she asked in her thick Maine accent over pumpkin spice lattes at a Starbucks here, as her son, who turned 13 on Tuesday, sat eating a cookie just out of earshot.In interviews, Ms. Hayward\u2019s mother, brother and a one-time colleague of hers at Mr. Moody\u2019s business, who asked to remain anonymous, separately corroborated her recollection of events.Two current Moody\u2019s employees, whose names were shared by his campaign, said they could not speak to the case itself but added that they were stunned that Mr. Moody was accused of mistreatment.\u201cWe have women who work in this company who have had children, we have women who are pregnant now,\u201d said Debra Gale, who has worked in Mr. Moody\u2019s Gorham store for 20 years. \u201cThey are not discriminated against whatsoever.\u201dAs for Ms. Hayward, Ms. Gale only pointed out that she had changed store locations and gently said: \u201cI don\u2019t feel we ever found a proper fit for her.\u201dMs. Hayward, who described herself as a Republican and a supporter of President Trump, said she had no political motivation in speaking out and was \u201cscared\u201d about reprisals from Mr. Moody. After being contacted by a reporter on Facebook, she agreed to discuss her story over the phone on an off-the-record basis. At the end of that conversation, she said she wanted to go public.She said she wanted to encourage other women and viewed her disclosure as a necessary part of the healing process from a difficult period in her life.\u201cIf I were to ever be able to say anything to him, it is that, I don\u2019t know if you realized that day how much you shaped someone\u2019s life,\u201d she said. \u201cYou shamed somebody for becoming a mother. And I had already been through a ton.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.The summer before she lost her job, Ms. Hayward helped win a conviction of her then-boyfriend, the father of her son, on felony charges related to his assaulting her. He was incarcerated for 18 months and she has not seen him since.After Mr. Moody fired her, Ms. Hayward said she called her brother, Joshua Hayward, who lived in Portland and had a finance and real estate company. He quickly connected her with a prominent New England law firm, Bernstein Shur.Ms. Hayward retained an employment law attorney there, Louis Butterfield. But once Mr. Moody found out she had hired a lawyer, Ms. Hayward said, he was furious.\u201cShawn went to his office ballistic,\u201d Ms. Hayward said, recalling that Mr. Butterfield asked him to leave because he could not discuss the case. \u201cHe called me and was like, \u2018I\u2019ve never had this happen to me in my entire life,\u2019\u201d she said of Mr. Butterfield. (The lawyer died in 2010.)Mr. Moody, citing the agreement, would not say if he visited Mr. Butterfield at his office.After losing her job, Ms. Hayward became desperate, struggling with working and taking care of her son. Without a place to live or a vehicle, she moved back in with her family in northern Maine.Ms. Hayward has since earned a teaching certificate, and she returned with her son to the Portland area where she is now a special education instructor.Ms. Hayward said she wants to make the best of her experience. She has jotted down notes in hopes of publishing a children\u2019s book that could empower young women. The title she has in mind: \u201cGirls, don\u2019t lose your voice.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should the Supreme Court Matter So Much?", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Kavanaugh controversy is a reminder of why the country\u2019s founders wanted a less powerful institution.Mr. McDonald is a law professor.If you paused during the heated battle over Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court nomination to ask yourself whether it made any sense for the appointment of one individual to one position in our government to matter so much, let me assure you: The answer is no. It doesn\u2019t make any sense.Americans have become so used to having the Supreme Court decree the country\u2019s policy on such vital matters as abortion, gun rights, same-sex marriage and campaign finance that they assume this is how the court is supposed to function. But that assumption is mistaken.When the founders established our system of self-government, they didn\u2019t expend much effort on the judicial branch. Of the roughly three and a half long pieces of inscribed parchment that make up the Constitution, the first two pages are devoted to designing Congress. Most of the next full page focuses on the president. The final three-quarters of a page contains various provisions, including just five sentences establishing a \u201csupreme court,\u201d any optional lower courts Congress might create and the types of cases those courts could hear.Why was the judicial branch given such short shrift? Because in a democracy, the political branches of government \u2014 those accountable to the people through elections \u2014 were expected to run things. The courts could get involved only as was necessary to resolve disputes, and even then under congressional supervision of their dockets.It was widely recognized that the Supreme Court was the least important of the three branches: It was the only branch to lack its own building (it was housed in a chamber of Congress), and the best lawyers were seldom enthusiastic about serving on it (John Jay, the court\u2019s first chief justice, resigned within six years and described the institution as lacking \u201cenergy, weight and dignity\u201d).When disputes came before the Supreme Court, the justices were expected to ensure that Americans received \u201cdue process\u201d \u2014 that they would be ruled by the \u201claw of the land\u201d rather than the whims of ruling individuals. In short, the court was to play a limited role in American democracy, and when it did get involved, its job was to ensure that its judgments were based on legal rules that were applied fairly and impartially.Yet in 1958, in the face of defiance by Southern states of its 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education requiring the desegregation of public schools, the Supreme Court declared that it was the \u201csupreme\u201d interpreter of all things constitutional in our system. Forgetting the court\u2019s confessed sins during the pre-New Deal era, the more liberal members on the court started inferring rights in the Constitution based again on vague notions of due process \u201cliberty.\u201dFirst there was an inferred right of contraceptive freedom. Then there was an inferred right of abortion, then of sexual privacy and then of same-sex marriage. Not to be outdone, the more conservative justices on the court, drawing on the First and Second Amendments, have discovered a personal right to have guns, a corporate right to spend unlimited money in American elections and, just this past summer, a worker\u2019s right to not help pay for collective bargaining by a union.When such vital matters of social policy are determined by a handful of unelected justices and their interpretations of malleable terms like \u201cliberty\u201d and \u201cfree speech,\u201d the American people are robbed of their ability to have a say about the rules that dictate how they live. One way or another, the Supreme Court needs to recover the founders\u2019 vision of its modest role in our system of self-government. When it is not clear to justices of both ideological stripes that the Constitution requires a ruling that will have major public policy implications, the court should leave it to the people to decide for themselves.Barry P. McDonald is a law professor at Pepperdine University.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Conservative Group\u2019s Closed-Door \u2018Training\u2019 of Judicial Clerks Draws Concern", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The closed-door \u201ctraining academy\u201d was aimed at a select group: recent law school graduates who had secured prestigious clerkships with federal judges. It was organized by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group that has played a leading role in moving the courts to the right, and it had some unusual requirements.\u201cGenerous donors,\u201d the application materials said, were making \u201ca significant financial investment in each and every attendee.\u201d In exchange, the future law clerks would be required to promise to keep the program\u2019s teaching materials secret and pledge not to use what they learned \u201cfor any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation.\u201dThe conservative legal movement has made bold moves before, and it has long cultivated law students and young lawyers, partly to ensure a deep bench of potential judicial nominees. The Heritage Foundation, along with the Federalist Society, helped compile the lists of potential Supreme Court nominees from which President Trump chose his two appointees, Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh. The two groups also helped identify many of the scores of Mr. Trump\u2019s appointees to the lower federal courts.But legal experts said the effort by Heritage to train and influence law clerks raised serious ethical questions and could undermine the duties the clerks have to the justice system and to the judges they will serve.On Thursday afternoon, a few hours after The New York Times published an online article about the training, Heritage announced that it was suspending the program.\u201cHeritage is re-evaluating the Federal Clerkship Training Academy,\u201d Greg Scott, a spokesman for the group, said in a statement. \u201cAs a result, the program will not go on as scheduled.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a private program, and that\u2019s the way we\u2019d like to keep it,\u201d she said in a brief interview Tuesday morning. \u201cWord did leak out a little bit about it, which is fine, but it\u2019s going to remain a private program.\u201dA few hours later on Tuesday, Heritage deleted the references to donors, secrecy and loyalty from the application materials it had posted on its website. Ms. Deutsch did not respond to a request for an explanation and to other questions about the program. Nor would she disclose the identities of the program\u2019s donors or its faculty, which was said to include several sitting federal appeals court judges and professors \u201cfrom various prominent law schools.\u201d\u201cI am not aware of anything like this on the progressive side,\u201d she said.According to the application materials, Heritage\u2019s unnamed donors were to pay for travel expenses to Washington, hotel rooms and meals during the three-day program. The curriculum would cover, the materials said, \u201coriginalism, textualism, habeas corpus, the Bill of Rights and other substantive legal and practical subject matter.\u201d Originalism and textualism are modes of interpreting the Constitution and statutes that are generally but not exclusively associated with conservatives.The application called for several short essays. One prompt said, \u201cPlease describe your understanding of originalism.\u201d Another said, \u201cPlease identify the United States Supreme Court justice (past or present) whose jurisprudential philosophy and approach to judging you agree with most, and explain why.\u201dIt was unclear whether an applicant hostile to originalism, which seeks to interpret the Constitution as it was understood by those who drafted and ratified it, or who named a liberal justice would have been admitted to the program.\u201cOne hallmark of the conservative legal community since the 1980s has been the efforts of its leaders to identify and nurture promising young lawyers with conservative views who may rise to important positions such as judgeships,\u201d he said. \u201cThis academy is a good example of those efforts.\u201d\u201cThe people who are chosen to clerk for federal judges are a talented group, and the application form indicates an interest in identifying and training future clerks who are especially accomplished and who are committed to conceptions of the law that conservatives favor,\u201d he said. \u201cThe willingness of conservative groups to invest in the future in this way is one reason that the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation could recommend potential Trump nominees to the Supreme Court with confidence that they were deeply rooted in their conservatism.\u201dThe aspects of the program described in the original materials and later deleted from Heritage\u2019s website raised troubling issues, some legal experts said.\u201cIt seems completely inconsistent with being a law clerk to agree to that kind of condition,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes that suggest they can\u2019t even talk to their judges about what they learn?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything intrinsically odd about an organization that has a point of view holding event to which law clerks or future law clerks are invited,\u201d she said, \u201cbut this reads like a kind of indoctrination.\u201dDecades ago, ideology played at most a minor role in most federal judges\u2019 selection of law clerks. But the emergence of the Federalist Society in the early 1980s helped change that, and these days many Republican appointees to the federal bench hire mostly conservative clerks and Democratic appointees mostly liberal ones.\u201cThis makes conservative networks such as the Federalist Society and now, it appears, the Heritage Foundation, very important in terms of nurturing and identifying young conservative legal talent,\u201d she said. \u201cThese networks could nurture the next generation of Neil Gorsuches or Brett Kavanaughs.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ajay Gupta, Riled by South African Graft Inquiry, Denies Charges From Afar", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUBAI, United Arab Emirates \u2014 Marooned outside South Africa, Ajay Gupta has been obsessively following the news from home with increasing frustration. Nearly every day for the past couple of months, witnesses at a high-profile inquiry on corruption have painted his family as the masterminds of the government looting that has engulfed the nation.The accusations infuriate him. But Mr. Gupta and his two brothers, who left South Africa early this year when President Jacob Zuma was forced out of power, have no plans to go back and give their side of the story \u2014 at least not yet. They say they fear wrongful arrests if they return to South Africa, a country where their power appeared uncontested less than a year ago.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m not coming to the commission,\u201d Mr. Gupta, the oldest brother, said in Dubai, where the family is now based. \u201cI will, but not this moment.\u201dHe added, \u201cI want to clear my name.\u201dSouth Africa\u2019s inquiry into state corruption has gripped the nation with its glimpses into the byzantine ways power has been amassed and wielded within the African National Congress, the party that has run the country since the end of apartheid. Scheming politicians, powerful bankers and prominent officials have featured prominently in the ever-lengthening cast of characters.Some experts say that the hearings could serve as a catharsis for a corruption-tainted era in the nation\u2019s history, the way the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission did two decades ago. That is, if a true picture emerges from the corruption hearings.The family, he said, was the victim of politically motivated law enforcement authorities and a witch hunt that could not stand scrutiny in court. Despite the many accusations that his family essentially defrauded the government by siphoning off enormous sums of money from government contracts and other deals, Mr. Gupta noted that prosecutors had charged them only once, in a case involving a dairy farm.In significant setbacks, prosecutors have twice failed to prove that the money siphoned from the dairy farm project, called Estina, directly benefited Mr. Gupta or other companies linked to the Gupta family. A high court judge released most of the assets frozen in the case in March, and the court ruled in favor of the companies linked to the Guptas again in May. A separate criminal case is still underway.\u201cWas Ajay Gupta or Gupta family proven guilty? One place? One smallest thing?\u201d Mr. Gupta asked.The government of Mr. Ramaphosa, who has made it a priority to fight corruption, had no choice but to endorse the inquiry, experts said.\u201cThe A.N.C. tried to duck and dive, but it got to a point where it had to push for a commission itself,\u201d said Prince Mashele, a political analyst and the author of \u201cThe Fall of the A.N.C. Continues: What Next?\u201d \u201cSo it was under pressure. It\u2019s not something that came from the A.N.C.\u201dWith national elections scheduled for next year, experts said that the inquiry was intended to give voters the impression that Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s government was cracking down on corruption. Most importantly, it could help rehabilitate the party\u2019s image by establishing the narrative that corruption was the result of a few bad apples in the party and, above all, the Gupta family.\u201cInstead, the inquiry has revealed that the entire party is rotten,\u201d Mr. Mashele said.In recent weeks, the actions of some of Mr. Ramaphosa\u2019s closest allies have come to light in the hearings, indicating that they were not completely innocent. A.N.C. leaders reacted angrily, saying that the party was \u201cnot on trial.\u201dMr. Nene, who had said in the past that he had never visited the Guptas\u2019 residence, said he had in fact done so on multiple occasions \u2014 even after becoming finance minister in 2014.\u201cI was not requested to do anything to benefit the Gupta family or Mr. Ajay Gupta, nor was I offered any inducement,\u201d he said in his statement to the commission.Mr. Nene issued an apology to the nation about the visits to the Gupta home, and he was forced to resign last week.Mr. Gupta, though, said there had been nothing wrong with Mr. Nene\u2019s visits to his home. \u201cForget Nene,\u201d he said. \u201cWe never asked any minister for any commercial benefit.\u201dOver the years, Mr. Gupta said, countless senior politicians from the A.N.C. and the opposition had visited his home.\u201cWho did not come and meet me? Or I not meet with them?\u201d Mr. Gupta said.He added: \u201cMeeting with people, there\u2019s nothing wrong. Every business organization meets with the politicians and the people.\u201dIn a hearing, Mr. Gupta\u2019s lawyer, Michael Hellens, argued on his behalf that the inquiry\u2019s goal of seeking the truth would be undermined without the brothers\u2019 testimony.\u201cYou will not have heard the evidence of the Guptas,\u201d Mr. Hellens said. \u201cNow what value will that finding be?\u201dWilliam Gumede, a political scientist at the University of Witwatersrand, said that even without the Guptas\u2019 testimony, the hearings were yielding answers.\u201cYou\u2019re getting the info, and you\u2019re building a picture, so when you get to the Guptas, you know exactly what you\u2019re looking for,\u201d he said.In Dubai, Mr. Gupta argued that the commission was simply not interested in hearing his side of the story.In one of the most explosive hearings, a former deputy finance minister, Mcebisi Jonas, said Mr. Zuma\u2019s son, Duduzane, took him to the Gupta residence in Johannesburg in late October 2015. Duduzane Zuma had worked for years for the Gupta family.The Gupta brother, he said, offered to make him rich in return for favorable treatment in the position.\u201cMr. Gupta repeated that they had information on me and that if I suggested that the meeting had occurred, they would kill me,\u201d Mr. Jonas said in a statement.In the Public Protector\u2019s 2016 report, Mr. Jonas said that the Gupta brother who made him the offer was Ajay, the oldest. But in the recent hearing, Mr. Jonas said that he was \u201crelatively certain\u201d that it was Ajay. He raised the \u201cpossibility that it might have been Rajesh,\u201d the youngest Gupta brother.In the interview, Ajay Gupta contended that he was not home during the meeting between Mr. Jonas and Mr. Zuma\u2019s son. His brother Rajesh \u201cdid not meet with Jonas at all,\u201d Mr. Gupta said. \u201cHe just came into the room for a fraction of a second, and say hello to Dudu.\u201d\u201cNobody from the family was there,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Loves These Risky Loans. The Rest of Us Should Be Wary. ", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA financial assembly line that went haywire a decade ago and contributed to an economic crisis is gearing up again on Wall Street.This time around, a similar kind of investment, called C.L.O.s, are at the heart of the boom. And that\u2019s not the only parallel: The loans are being made to risky borrowers, lending standards are dropping fast, and regulators are easing the rules. While it isn\u2019t necessarily destined to end in a 2008-style collapse, the situation today is eerily familiar. Even top Federal Reserve policymakers cited the surging growth of this market as a reason to \u201cremain mindful of vulnerabilities\u201d and possible risks to the financial system.\u201cIf there turns out to be an issue, this is where the unfinished business of the post-crisis financial reform efforts is going to be revealed,\u201d said Daniel K. Tarullo, a professor at Harvard Law School and a former oversight governor for bank regulation at the Fed. The process of issuing loans, packaging them together and carving them into investments has many names: securitization, structured finance, even shadow banking.The last shadow-banking frenzy on Wall Street centered on home loans, which were repackaged into investments used to build collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.s. Banks pooled millions of mortgages \u2014 some of them to borrowers with a shaky ability to repay \u2014 to create C.D.O.s. They kept some, and the rest they sold off to a slew of other investors: in-house hedge funds, European banks, large American pension plans and more. The investments at play now are C.L.O.s, for collateralized loan obligations. But this time, the underlying loans aren\u2019t going to high-risk homeowners. They\u2019re going to high-risk companies. These C.L.O.s are made up of loans to between 100 and 300 already indebted corporate borrowers. Sears, which filed for bankruptcy this week, was among the companies that took what are called leveraged loans.Traditionally, such loan contracts would have all sorts of protections, known as covenants, aimed at providing investors an early warning that borrowers were getting in trouble. These covenants keep debtor companies from acting in ways that put payments to investors at risk. They restrict things like paying out dividends to owners, and put limits on additional borrowing. And when loans are repackaged and sold, most of the money effectively comes from the investors, not the banks. And there\u2019s a tendency to be less careful when lending other people\u2019s money. This incentive problem was at the heart of the lending that led to the last financial crisis. To fix that problem, the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law required the loan packagers to retain some of the risks of the investments they created. But those rules have been weakened this year. A court decision exempted some of the firms that create C.L.O.s from a requirement that they hold at least 5 percent of the credit risk in such investments. The Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission declined to appeal the decision. Right now, leveraged loans are some of the easiest products for financial firms to sell. Unlike most bond investments, which have fixed interest rates, leveraged loans typically have floating interest rates. Floating-rate products do better than most bonds when interest rates rise, and those rates have been climbing. As long as rates continue to push higher, there will be a demand for leveraged loans. But not everybody is thrilled with the idea of lending to already indebted companies, so financial engineers have transformed these loans into something more attractive. C.L.O.s, which have been around since the mid-1990s, are a type of asset-backed security, which is, essentially, a kind of bond. But unlike a regular bond, in which a single company repays interest and principal to bondholders, they combine multiple repayment streams \u2014 thousands of monthly credit card, auto loan or mortgage payments, for example \u2014 and funnel them to investors. Broadly speaking, here\u2019s how it works. A C.L.O. manager buys a diverse bunch of leveraged loans and simultaneously lines up investors who are willing to buy a piece of this package. Each quarter, the indebted companies make payments on those loans, and that money is channeled to the end investors.But C.L.O. investors aren\u2019t all the same. They get to pick what is more important to them: low-risk returns or big payday potential.Let\u2019s imagine that the proceeds from C.L.O.s are a pizza that arrives each quarter. Those who are first in line take only a small amount of pizza: Low risk, low reward.The investors at the end of the line take what\u2019s left when everyone else has eaten. This is risky: If only a small pie comes to the door, there\u2019s a chance that there won\u2019t be any when it\u2019s their turn. Right now, there is more than enough pizza for everybody at the party. The American economy is strong. Gross domestic product grew at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter. Unemployment is near 50-year lows. Corporate earnings are high. That means most of the companies that took out these loans are having no trouble with their payments. In fact, defaults on leveraged loans are quite low. The good times can\u2019t last forever, but that doesn\u2019t mean C.L.O.s will bring down the economy.The size of the C.L.O. market is only about one-tenth the size of the American mortgage market during the years before the crisis a decade ago.But it\u2019s not exactly small, either. The market for leveraged loans is larger than the market for junk bonds. And blowups in the junk bond market \u2014 most notably in the late 1980s \u2014 have caused problems before. And while people in the C.L.O. business point out that these assets fared pretty well during the last recession, nobody knows how the investments will perform when the next downturn comes.All of that makes the C.L.O. business a prime example of the type of finance that has fueled bubbles, booms and busts in recent years. \u201cMaybe this would be just a bad recession when this collapses, not the Great Depression,\u201d said Simon Johnson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be as bad,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it could still be bad.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Will Testify Against El Chapo at Trial?", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor nearly two years, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have been promising to prove their case against Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n Loera, the Mexican drug lord known as El Chapo, by bringing a small army of witnesses into court to testify against him.But public court documents and media reports have provided clues about which of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s former allies, rivals and underlings might ultimately take the stand after his trial begins in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Nov. 5.Here is a look at a few of them.For nearly a decade, beginning in 1998, the brothers Pedro and Margarito Flores were two of Chicago\u2019s most prolific drug dealers, overseeing the distribution of hundreds of millions of dollars in Mexican cocaine in their hometown and in dozens of other cities across the United States, the government says.But in 2005, while they were in Mexico, they met a man who claimed to be a lifelong friend of Mr. Guzm\u00e1n. The man, the brothers have testified, recruited them to work for Mr. Guzm\u00e1n, and they began receiving cocaine shipments from the kingpin, smuggled in luxury yachts, submarines and airplanes, even a custom-fitted Boeing 747.Before the trial began, however, the case erupted into chaos: Mr. Zambada-Niebla\u2019s lawyers claimed that for years, he had been working as an informant for the Drug Enforcement Administration, trading tips about his drug world rivals in exchange for the freedom to run his own business.A former Mexican security official, Damaso Lopez Nu\u00f1ez is perhaps best known for having helped Mr. Guzm\u00e1n escape from his cell in the notorious Puente Grande prison in Jalisco State in 2001. After rendering that favor, prosecutors say, Mr. Lopez went to work for Mr. Guzm\u00e1n and spent the next 16 years climbing the ranks of the Sinaloa cartel.According to court papers released last month, Mr. Lopez, known as El Licenciado (a reference to his college degree), \u201coversaw the financing\u201d of huge shipments of cocaine into Mexico from Central and South America. Based in the city of Culiac\u00e1n, the papers say, he also had an army of \u201csicarios,\u201d or assassins, at his command to carry out murders, kidnappings, acts of torture and to serve as debt collectors.On Sept. 28, Mr. Lopez pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges at a court appearance in Alexandria, Va.Damaso Lopez-Serrano, a son of El Licenciado, came to be in American custody in a highly unusual way: In July 2017, he turned himself in to United States border officials at the Calexico West Port of Entry in Mexicali, Mexico.At the time, the Mexican media were reporting that he was embroiled in a violent power struggle with Mr. Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s sons over control of the Sinaloa drug cartel. He was also wanted by the Mexican authorities.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazil Can\u2019t Afford to Ignore Its Dire Economic Outlook", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNeither of the two presidential candidates has offered a comprehensive plan for an increasingly shaky economy.Dr. de Bolle is the director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins University.Driven by anger, resentment and a desire to obliterate the establishment, Brazilians chose on Sunday two presidential candidates at the extreme ends of the ideological spectrum. Jair Bolsonaro, a hard-right firebrand who has spoken fondly of the country\u2019s bygone military dictatorship, and the left-wing Fernando Haddad, from the corruption-mired Brazil\u2019s Worker\u2019s Party, will now face off in a second round of voting on Oct. 28. The economy has not fully recovered from the recession of 2015-16, the worst ever to hit the country. Growth has resumed, but not enough to create jobs for the more than 13 million unemployed Brazilian workers. Inflation has been contained, despite recent financial market turbulence, but wages are stagnant. Most ominous, Brazil has high and uncontrolled deficits and a debt-to-G.D.P. ratio that are unsustainable. These challenges require comprehensive action: spending cuts and tax increases, accompanied by pension reform. Without urgent moves, debt could reach 100 percent of G.D.P. in the next two years, leaving the government unable to finance itself. A fiscal crisis would tip the country back into recession, slashing even more jobs in an already grim labor market.Mr. Bolsonaro or Mr. Haddad will have no choice but to face up to this dire outlook. But so far, neither candidate seems willing to do so. Although austerity could hurt growth in the short term, the only way to reduce the widening gap between revenues and expenditures is by paying the price of a weaker economy now to guarantee the return of stability and growth later. The politics of the moment will complicate this prescription.  The next president will face a highly fragmented Congress; 30 political parties will have seats in the next session, up from 28. And neither candidate has the right political experience to build stable coalitions.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s party, the Social Liberal Party, known as the PSL, made big gains Sunday, winning 52 seats to the lower house of Congress. It\u2019s now the second biggest party in Congress, behind Mr. Haddad\u2019s PT. And Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters also look likely to win governorships in key states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, Brazil\u2019s most populous state, in the runoff on Oct. 28. But Mr. Bolsonaro has promised to halve the number of cabinet positions to reduce costs, and this may hurt his ability to forge a stable coalition. Brazil has some 29 cabinet posts \u2014 much too many. Coalitions are built by handing off cabinet jobs to allied parties. If there are fewer cabinet positions on offer, the incentive for political parties to align with the president is lowered, making legislation much more difficult to pass. Mr. Haddad\u2019s PT holds 56 seats in Congress, a decrease from 2014 but still the most in Congress. As president, he would face hostility from Bolsonaro-supporting governors, who have a lot of influence in Congress, helping to shape policies or hampering reform. Mr. Haddad, if elected, would also have to confront anger toward his party for recent corruption scandals. Many former members of PT\u2019s leadership are in prison, including former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Despite these political challenges, we still have little idea what the candidates would do for the economy, less than three weeks from the runoff. In previous elections, candidates presented comprehensive economic plans. Not this time. Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. Haddad have been vague and general when discussing the economy. To be fair, Brazilian voters have been mainly concerned about corruption and violence. Rio de Janeiro, which hosted the Olympic Games in 2016, has had such a spike in violence that federal government ordered a military intervention. Brazilians have wanted to hear candidates\u2019 plans for cleaning up the government and restoring law and order.Mr. Bolsonaro, in choosing a prominent, pro-market chief economic adviser, has hinted that he plans to embrace a more liberal economic philosophy. But he is known to have nationalistic views, with a preference for state intervention to drive growth \u2014 not unlike policies that the PT has pursued in the recent past. Some observers appear to believe that his views have changed \u2014 but in the absence of detailed plans, there\u2019s little reason to believe that. Mr. Haddad has also failed to offer much substance. Although he has vowed to study the pension crisis, he has not recognized that reform is necessary. Moreover, he has defended the need for a strong public investment program to create jobs, but he has not explained where the money will come from. Mr. Haddad has talked loosely about the need for tax reform, but there\u2019s no clarity on what measures it would entail. It is likely that he would need to bow to the wishes of the left-wing PT leadership and thus avoid politically unpopular fiscal reforms. Following Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s strong showing on Sunday, the currency rallied and stock markets rose. Markets dipped on Wednesday, as they did around the globe, but enough investors appear to believe that Mr. Bolsonaro, if elected, will deliver pension and fiscal reform. Yet we don\u2019t have good reason to be sure. No matter what happens on Oct. 28, the economic outlook is bleak. Brazil\u2019s problems are far from over, and the two presidential candidates don\u2019t appear to have the plans or the political capital to make the necessary reforms. There is still too little to cheer in Latin America\u2019s largest economy.Monica de Bolle is the director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins University.Advertisement"}

Other real estate agencies reported similar declines in sales volume and price.That the top of the market remains soft is not surprising \u2014 a glut of new condo construction and a lack of urgency from mostly all-cash high-end buyers have hobbled luxury sales for several quarters.But a sharp increase in inventory of studio and one-bedroom apartments suggests a slowdown of the broader market, said Jonathan Miller, the real estate appraiser who prepared the Elliman report. There was a 21 percent jump in the number of one-bedroom apartments for sale, compared to the same period last year \u2014 the most of any category \u2014 followed by a 15.5 percent increase in the number of studios on the market.\u201cThink of it as a correlation with rising mortgage rates,\u201d Mr. Miller said, noting that the entry-level market is more dependent on financing, and climbing rates have more buyers hesitating. About 63 percent of sales under $500,000 in the most recent quarter included financing, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re really seeing hesitancy,\u201d said Diane Ramirez, chief executive of Halstead, which also released a new report. Resales, which make up more than 85 percent of the market, spent an average of 104 days on the market, up 11 percent from the same period last year, she said. She blamed the slowdown over the summer, typically one of the most robust seasons for home sales, on a buildup of inventory across all price points.Overall inventory rose 23 percent, compared to that of the same period last year, according to a new Corcoran report, making it the eighth straight quarter in which supply was higher than in the previous year.\u201cSellers have to be razor-sharp on pricing,\u201d Ms. Ramirez said, or their listings may get lost in the shuffle.Still, the market is not exactly sputtering. For context, Mr. Miller said, there were 2,987 sales last quarter \u2014 about 9.5 percent more than the 10-year average.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a reset,\u201d he said, after several years of record price growth and sales. Even with the slowdown, about 9.1 percent of apartments sold above asking price, when a stable market might have just 5 to 7 percent of units entering a bidding war, he said. (The market peaked in 2015, when 31 percent of listings sold over list price.)What remains to be seen is how much downward pressure the recent tax overhaul will have on prices in the coming months. Because of limitations placed on local, state and property tax deductions, which are expected to disproportionately affect high-cost housing markets like that of New York, Mr. Miller said he expected some hand-wringing from price-conscious buyers.\u201cWhen people start writing checks on their April tax bill, they\u2019re going to see the higher costs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just becomes more visceral.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Israel Accuses Iran of Ordering Palestinian Rocket Fire From Gaza", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 Israel accused Iran on Saturday of ordering attacks by the Palestinian militant group that took responsibility for a heavy barrage of rocket fire from Gaza overnight.Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, an Israel military spokesman, said the Iranian Revolutionary Guards\u2019 Quds Force had communicated directly with Islamic Jihad, a mostly Iranian financed extremist group in Gaza, and had ordered and orchestrated the rocket fire.\u201cWe do not take that lightly,\u201d Colonel Conricus said, adding that Israel had passed messages through third parties warning that any Israeli response would not necessarily be \u201cconfined to geographic areas,\u201d meaning that it could extend beyond Gaza.While the focus was on Iran, Colonel Conricus also accused neighboring Syria of playing an unspecified role in the rocket fire, suggesting that the orders might have come from Iranian forces deployed there.A spokesman for Islamic Jihad, Daoud Shehab, denied that the group had acted on orders from Iran\u2019s Quds Force or any other outside force. He said the group had retaliated for the killing of four Palestinians by Israeli forces on Friday during weekly protest along the Gaza border fence.\u201cWhat we did was a duty to defend the blood spilled by the army on the Gaza borders,\u201d Mr. Shehab said.Islamic Jihad generally works in coordination with Hamas, the larger Islamic militant group that controls the Gaza Strip. But Islamic Jihad sometimes asserts itself and competes with Hamas.In an apparent attempt to pull back before dragging Gaza and Israel into a wider escalation, however, Islamic Jihad said Saturday that it was stopping rocket launches and that, with Egypt\u2019s help, an understanding had been reached to restore calm.Israel has fought three wars against the militant groups in Gaza over the past decade, the last one in 2014.Israeli and Palestinian analysts speculated over possible Iranian motives for ordering the launches of nearly 40 short-range rockets in four barrages from nightfall on Friday until about 10 a.m. on Saturday.Several said it most likely had to do with an Iranian desire to disrupt broader efforts by Egypt and the United Nations to stabilize the cease-fire that ended the 2014 war between Gaza and Israel, and possibly to expand the terms of the truce.Some analysts view the cease-fire talks as part of a more ambitious American plan for an Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement that might soon be presented by President Trump.\u201cEven if the Iranians want to confuse everything, there is no chance they can do that now,\u201d said Talal Okal, a Palestinian writer and political analyst living in Gaza City, adding that both sides were moving toward a stable truce.While Israel wants quiet, Hamas wants an easing of the blockade on Gaza that Israel imposes, with Egypt\u2019s help, citing security concerns. Such an easing would provide some relief for the two million residents of the impoverished coastal enclave.In one small sign of progress this past week, Israel resumed the transfer of Qatari-funded fuel shipments into Gaza to alleviate a chronic electricity shortage there. The fuel transfers had been suspended in mid-October in response to previous violence along the border.\u201cIslamic Jihad knows it cannot change the current,\u201d Mr. Okal said by phone from Gaza City. \u201cBut at this moment, it is motivated to present itself as an independent faction and not one that is always subject to the decisions of Hamas.\u201dRon Ben-Yishai, a military affairs commentator for Ynet, a Hebrew news site, wrote on Saturday that Iran most likely wanted to spoil any plans for a grand Israeli-Palestinian deal and to pressure the Americans not to go ahead with the next wave of sanctions against Tehran\u2019s oil exports.The rocket fire began soon after Israeli forces killed four Palestinians and wounded scores during the border protest on Friday. The Israeli military said rioters had hurled grenades, firebombs and rocks and in two cases, Palestinians briefly crossed the fence into Israeli territory.No Israeli soldiers were hurt. On Saturday, a fifth Palestinian man died of wounds sustained the day before.Israel\u2019s Iron Dome anti-rocket defense system intercepted about 17 rockets that appeared headed toward Israeli civilian communities \u2014 mainly the border town of Sderot \u2014 according to the military. Others fell in open ground.The Israeli military said it first responded with airstrikes against 87 targets belonging to Hamas, which Israel ultimately holds responsible for all violence emanating from Gaza, and later against eight targets belonging to Islamic Jihad.Yusuf bin Alawi bin Abdullah, the foreign minister of Oman, on Saturday offered some insight into the role the sultanate sees itself playing in efforts to reach an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal.Speaking at the Manama Dialogue organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies is the Bahraini capital, Manama, he described the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a relic of the past that the Middle East and the region needed to move beyond for its own security and development.He said that Oman felt the time was right to began making \u201cmodest efforts\u201d to bring the parties together.\u201cWe are not mediators in this issue, but we are providing facilitation and ideas that could have something new in them,\u201d he said, adding that the real work of brokering an agreement had to come from the United States.Iyad Abuheweila contributed reporting from Gaza and Ben Hubbard from Manama, Bahrain.Advertisement"}

What About \u2018Deutschland 86\u2019?", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 When the spy series \u201cDeutschland 83\u201d had its premiere in 2015, it was portrayed as a breakthrough moment for German television. At that point, the country had yet to produce any prestige shows with an international following, unlike France and Denmark. The series, which followed a young East German soldier corralled into working as an undercover agent on the other side of the Iron Curtain, was the first German show to air on an American network, SundanceTV. In Britain it became the most-watched foreign-language drama ever.In making \u201cDeutschland 86\u201d \u2014 the second season of the show, which began airing on SundanceTV in the United States last week, and has been streaming on Amazon Prime in Germany, Austria and Switzerland since Oct. 19 \u2014 its creators had to confront the awkward reality of the first season\u2019s geographically divergent popularity. \u201cI would be honest and say it was quite painful,\u201d Ms. Winger said in a recent interview in Berlin alongside her husband. \u201cEvery interview I gave for two years began with, \u2018How does it feel to have made the most publicized flop in the history of German TV?\u2019 \u201dAlthough Ms. Winger says the first season\u2019s reception had little impact on their creative decision-making, \u201cDeutschland 86\u201d introduces an international setting and a more diverse cast. Its first episode finds East German foreign intelligence operative Lenora Rauch (Maria Schrader) working in South Africa with Rose Seithathi (Florence Kasumba) of the African National Congress. The spy been tasked with carrying out an illegal arms deal to help fill the coffers of the dwindling East German treasury. When the plan hits a snag, Lenora asks her nephew, Martin Rauch (Jonas Nay), for help, setting in motion a series of intrigues that take him across the continent.Ms. Winger said they had always planned to use a second season to explore the ways East Germany saw the world outside of its borders. \u201cYou don\u2019t often hear about how the East Germans felt their role was in global politics,\u201d Ms. Winger said. The Wingers also wanted to examine lesser-known elements of the Cold War, settling on the attempts by communist and Western powers to influence politics in Africa. \u201cThe Cold War is now romanticized as this simple, black-and-white world, but if you look a bit closer, you find it was much more complicated,\u201d Mr. Winger said.Germany\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for the first season, Mr. Winger said, was surprising partly because of the country\u2019s seemingly enormous appetite for television about its own tumultuous 20th-century history. But he pointed out that most German television takes an earnest, deferential approach to the subject matter, and some viewers might have been put off by the more freewheeling and humorous take on the Cold War in \u201cDeutschland 83.\u201d\u201cIn Germany, there is a certain look that is called \u2018authentic,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Winger said. \u201cI think there is a certain audience in Germany that doesn\u2019t want its historical drama to be stylized.\u201dHe said he also received numerous complaints about minor historical errors, like, for example, an inaccurately worn West German army uniform. \u201cEvery TV series builds its version of the past,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not going for historical detail, we were going for psychological realism.\u201dMr. Winger noted that RTL, a TV station known in Germany for its reality programming and police procedurals, was always an awkward fit for a prestige spy drama. He said the network was willing to broadcast a second season, but only if the Wingers tweaked it to be closer to its other, more popular series. \u201cYou should have seen the notes,\u201d Ms. Winger said. Ultimately, the show\u2019s production company, UFA Fiction, financed a second season with Amazon Prime as the German distributor, allowing the Wingers to maintain their original vision for the show.\u201cI don\u2019t think we made the show more for an international audience,\u201d Ms. Winger said. \u201cIt\u2019s such intense work, that when you\u2019re making it, you\u2019re making something that first and foremost you like.\u201dIn the years since \u201cDeutschland 83\u201d premiered, a number of other German series have been exported overseas. \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d an expensive coproduction between the German public broadcaster ARD and the private Sky channel, was sold in 60 countries. Last year, Netflix premiered its first German-language show, \u201cDark,\u201d and recently announced that it was producing five new German-language shows in addition to an already planned crime show, \u201cDogs of Berlin.\u201dMs. Winger recalled attending a recent TV showcase for Amazon Prime in London, where she was struck by the geographical diversity of the series being presented. Like Netflix, Amazon Prime has moved into producing more original foreign-language series, including \u201cBeat,\u201d a coming crime series set in Berlin.\u201cNow it\u2019s less that there\u2019s American shows and then a couple of things from other places, or that there are German shows and there are American shows, it\u2019s that there are good shows and bad shows,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always felt that way, but now I feel like everyone feels it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Every Democrat Outraised a G.O.P. Incumbent in 14 New York and New Jersey House Races", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn the months before President Trump\u2019s election in 2016, only one candidate for Congress \u2014 the speaker of the House \u2014 raised more than $2 million in the final full quarter before Election Day.This year is different.In New York and New Jersey alone, four Democrats, all first-time candidates, broke the $2 million benchmark, and one nearly doubled it. In those states, all of the Democrats running to unseat Republican House members outraised their opponents in the last three months \u2014 some by multiple orders of magnitude, others by millions of dollars.In Staten Island, the last Republican clinging to a New York City congressional seat, Representative Dan Donovan, saw his Democratic challenger outraise him by a ratio of nearly five to one.And in New Jersey, a trio of new Democratic candidates, Mikie Sherrill, Tom Malinowski and Andy Kim, shattered records to raise $7.3 million between them, outpacing their three Republican opponents in battleground districts by a combined $5 million, recent Federal Election Commission records show.The lopsided fund-raising numbers from all 14 Democratic challengers in the two states \u2014 from the longest of shots to the surest of bets \u2014 amount to a dramatic financial show of force that will fund a drumbeat of television spots, political mailers and digital ads in a crucial region for the Democratic effort to take power in the House.The New York and New Jersey figures represent a particularly sharp example of a nationwide trend that the head of a top Republican super PAC recently warned top donors amounted to a \u201cgreen wave\u201d of Democratic cash threatening to sweep Republicans from power in the congressional midterms.\u201cI have never seen, nor has anybody seen, this type of money generated in the campaigns,\u201d said Thomas M. Reynolds, a former Republican congressman in New York who previously oversaw the House G.O.P. campaign efforts nationally. \u201cWhat used to be really good money on the Republican side is being dwarfed by how much money progressives have raised.\u201dWith the midterm elections approaching, we tracked the war chests of candidates in the tightest House races.Antonio Delgado, the Democratic nominee in a battleground seat that stretches north from the Hudson Valley, paced the field not just in New York but nationally. He has raised $3.8 million since July to unseat the freshman Republican Representative John Faso, who collected $1 million. Only two Democratic House candidates in the nation reported a bigger haul than Mr. Delgado as of late Monday.What strategists of both parties have said is remarkable about the latest fund-raising figures is the sheer breadth of Democratic candidates who have been lifted financially, often by small donors who have ignored the political prognosticators in determining which candidates to open their wallets for.Or take Tracy Mitrano, who is running for Congress in a rural New York district that does not even merit a mention on the Cook Political Report\u2019s list of the more than 100 most potentially competitive seats. She outraised the Republican incumbent, Representative Tom Reed, by more than $200,000 in the last three months.In the most contested race in New York, Anthony Brindisi, a Democratic state assemblyman, raised $1.4 million and spent $2 million against Ms. Tenney (also double her total) to contest the 22nd District. He still entered October with more cash than her, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s visit to Utica in August.Perhaps the best news for Republicans is that despite the avalanche of Democratic money, many still entered October on at least equal financial footing, often as a result of years of incumbency or past fund-raising.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Mr. Reed, for instance, had nearly $1.3 million in the bank, almost double Ms. Mitrano\u2019s $684,000. Mr. Katko entered October with a slight cash lead, too, despite being badly outraised in recent months.Similarly, the Republican incumbent Lee Zeldin was outraised by his Democratic challenger Perry Gershon, $1 million to $1.5 million, in the last three months in a district at the far end of Long Island.But Mr. Zeldin, whose coffers were boosted by an event headlined by Donald Trump Jr. over the summer, still entered October with $1.8 million on hand, compared with $535,000 for Mr. Gershon. Mr. Trump carried the seat in 2016 after President Barack Obama won it four years earlier.Ms. Sherrill, a former Navy pilot and federal prosecutor, is favored in the northern New Jersey district of another retiring Republican, Rodney Frelinghuysen. She raised over $2 million more than the Republican in that race.The two New Jersey Democrats running against Republican incumbents, Mr. Kim in the Third District and Mr. Malinowski in the Seventh, raised $2.3 million each. For Mr. Kim, that is $1 million more than Representative Tom MacArthur; Mr. Malinowski quadrupled the $562,000 haul of the Republican congressman he is challenging, Leonard Lance.Mr. Collins\u2019s Democratic challenger, Nate McMurray, had raised little until the indictment, but pulled in more than $500,000 in the last three months.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Far-Reaching Threats of a Conservative Court", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWill the Supreme Court wipe out the government protections that have shielded Americans from abusive business practices since the New Deal?Mr. Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. With the start of the Supreme Court\u2019s new term, many people are wondering whether the conservative majority, which has taken a further step to the right with the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh, will overturn Roe v. Wade. But that\u2019s not where the action is. As two cases argued before the court this month illustrate, the real question is whether it will undermine the system of government that has protected the public from abusive business practices since the New Deal.Liberals might root against the government \u2014 the immigration and sex offender policies are harsh. But they should be careful what they wish for. The conservative majority can, and most likely will, rule against the government using broad theories that would also eat away at the constitutional foundations of the New Deal system, which is essential for protecting health and safety, the environment and much else.The New Deal agencies initially encountered resistance from the Supreme Court, which was then, like now, a reactionary institution that frowned on novelty. For one thing, when agencies issue regulations, they make law, which was the traditional prerogative of Congress. Moreover, the agencies were mostly overseen by the White House, which is not supposed to make law. And Congress also gave many regulatory agencies some autonomy \u2014 protecting staff from removal, for example \u2014 that seemed to infringe on the president\u2019s authority to supervise the executive branch.Eventually, common sense prevailed over these legalistic objections. Congress itself lacked the capacity to engage in the detailed regulation that is necessary to keep a modern economy humming while protecting workers and consumers. Agencies were needed. The executive branch was the sensible place to house agencies because the agencies combined both policymaking and enforcement functions. And agencies need some protection from political meddling.By the 1980s, half a century after the New Deal, a political and legal consensus in favor of the administrative state had solidified. Left and right argued about how much regulation was needed, of course, but no one doubted the constitutional foundations of the administrative state \u2014 not even Justice Antonin Scalia, the leading conservative lawyer of the past half century and an academic expert on administrative law before he ascended to the bench.But Brett Kavanaugh is a skeptic. And so are Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump\u2019s first appointment to the Supreme Court, and Clarence Thomas, who was appointed back in 1991. The views of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito are less clear, but their judicial opinions point in the same direction.The conservative assault on the administrative state has four elements.What is the basis for this radical change in the law? Justices Kavanaugh, Gorsuch and Thomas claim to be \u201coriginalists,\u201d who believe that the court should strike down laws that violate the original understanding of the Constitution. But the founders did not bar Congress from creating administrative agencies or think that the First Amendment protected businesses from commercial regulation.The answer is both obvious and depressing. The modern conservative jurisprudence is an exercise in nostalgia, a yearning for pre-New Deal America when, supposedly, government was less oppressive and people were freer than they are today. You can see this nostalgia in the homilies to olden times in Justices Gorsuch\u2019s and Kavanaugh\u2019s lectures \u2014 and their insistence that answers to today\u2019s challenges can be found in a theory of government invented in the 18th century by men wearing breeches and powdered wigs.This jurisprudence appeals to many people in a populist era that distrusts experts, chafes at bureaucracy, fears change and longs for a simpler past. But like so much being peddled by ideologues and partisans these days, it\u2019s a sham. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Officials Make It Easier for States to Skirt Health Law\u2019s Protections", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration announced a new policy on Monday making it easier for states to circumvent coverage requirements and consumer protections in the Affordable Care Act.States could, for example, use federal funds to subsidize short-term insurance plans with skimpy benefits and fewer protections for people with pre-existing conditions.Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said the administration\u2019s new policy \u201crolls out the red carpet for junk insurance.\u201dThe timing of the announcement, just before an election in which the protection of people with pre-existing conditions has been a top-tier issue, was puzzling. In a separate initiative on Monday, the administration said it was proposing a regulation to let employers provide money to employees to buy individual health insurance coverage on their own, rather than enrolling in an employer-sponsored health plan.Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who devised the policy allowing states more flexibility, said it was necessary to achieve President Trump\u2019s goals: to make health insurance more affordable by expanding choices, increasing competition, reducing federal regulations and giving states more power to revamp their health insurance markets. She said states had asked for more flexibility.Under the restrictive guidance issued by the Obama administration in 2015, Ms. Verma said, \u201cstates have largely lost the power to advance and adopt their own solutions.\u201d Waivers issued under the new policy \u201cwill allow states to get out from under the onerous rules imposed by the Affordable Care Act,\u201d she added.A provision of the 2010 health law, added at the behest of Mr. Wyden, allows waivers for innovations in state health policy. The federal law stipulates that state programs must provide coverage that is \u201cat least as comprehensive\u201d as that available under the Affordable Care Act, and must cover \u201cat least a comparable number\u201d of people.Under the new policy, states will be able to count people with short-term insurance as having coverage even though it does not provide all the benefits required by the Affordable Care Act. Such plans often omit coverage for maternity care, prescription drugs and treatment for mental illness and drug abuse. They often exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions, as well.\u201cThis is a new day, a new approach to empower states,\u201d Ms. Verma said. \u201cStates know much better than the federal government how their markets work.\u201dThe new policy, to be published on Wednesday in the Federal Register, says, \u201cThis guidance permits states to provide access to less comprehensive or less affordable coverage as an additional option for their residents to choose.\u201dThe new guidance takes effect immediately, but consumers will not feel its effect until 2020 because benefits and premiums for next year have already been set. The annual open enrollment period starts on Nov. 1.Democrats said the new insurance options would attract healthier people, leaving sicker people in the Affordable Care Act marketplace, where they could face higher premiums.\u201cJust weeks before the election, Republicans are once again undermining protections for people with pre-existing conditions and sabotaging our health care system,\u201d said the Senate Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer of New York.The Trump administration said the goal of the new policy was to \u201cloosen excessive restrictions that limit state flexibility and consumer choice.\u201dBut top House Democrats responsible for health legislation said Republicans, who spent much of last year trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, could not be trusted. \u201cLoosening coverage requirements undermines protections that have helped millions of people gain access to affordable care,\u201d said a statement issued on Monday by Representatives Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey and Robert C. Scott of Virginia, all Democrats.Asked about the criticism from Democrats, a Trump administration official offered an assurance not found in the guidance: No waivers that would erode protections for pre-existing conditions will be approved. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to elaborate on the new policy.In the initiative directed at employers, as many as 10 million employees could have coverage through the new \u201chealth reimbursement arrangements,\u201d and almost one million of them would be newly insured, an administration official estimated.The Obama administration generally blocked such use of health reimbursement arrangements. The Internal Revenue Service said in 2014 that employers could not meet their obligations under the health law by simply reimbursing employees for some or all of their premium costs. The law requires larger employers to offer coverage to full-time employees.Under the proposed regulation, employers of any size could set up health reimbursement arrangements to help employees buy coverage on their own. But Trump administration officials said the new arrangements would be particularly helpful to smaller employers.Employers with fewer than 50 employees are generally not required to offer coverage, and administration officials said that the proportion of such employers offering coverage had declined since 2010.Advertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tech giant is positioning itself in schools as a trusted authority on digital citizenship at a moment when the company\u2019s data-handling practices are under growing scrutiny.Google is on a mission to teach children how to be safe online. That is the message behind \u201cBe Internet Awesome,\u201d a so-called digital-citizenship education program that the technology giant developed for schools.Among other things, these critics argue, the company\u2019s lessons give children the mistaken impression that the main threat they face online is from malicious hackers and bullies, glossing over the privacy concerns that arise when tech giants like Google itself collect users\u2019 personal information and track their actions online.As an analysis of Google\u2019s curriculum published in Emerging Library & Information Perspectives, a graduate student journal at Western University in Ontario, put it, \u201c\u2018Be Internet Awesome\u2019 generally presents Google as impartial and trustworthy, which is especially problematic given that the target audience is impressionable youth.\u201dJim Accomando, the president of the National P.T.A., said that the organization \u201cdoes not endorse any commercial product or service,\u201d although companies that give money to the group may receive \u201cpromotional consideration.\u201d\u201cGoogle is a great example of a partner that aligns with our goals, and they have deep tech knowledge that they bring to the table,\u201d he said.The cartoon game, Interland, offers an animated world \u201cpresented by Google.\u201d In it, children navigate spammers and hackers in \u201cReality River\u201d and consider who in their social network can see what they post online on \u201cMindful Mountain.\u201dThe game, which comes with a lesson plan and classroom activities, is meant to teach children \u201cthe fundamentals of digital citizenship and safety so they can explore the online world with confidence,\u201d according to Google\u2019s site description. Once students learn skills like how to create strong passwords and not share information with strangers, the program encourages them to be \u201cfearless\u201d online explorers.Kerry Gallagher, an assistant principal at St. John\u2019s Preparatory School in Danvers, Mass., said Google\u2019s program helped students learn concrete ways to be safer and kinder online.\u201cRather than being a bystander, they feel as though they have the skills to intervene\u201d when they observe other children being mean online, Ms. Gallagher said. She added that younger students also gained a \u201cbetter sense for who they should share things with and who they shouldn\u2019t, depending on what that content is.\u201dGoogle\u2019s name appears on every screen of Interland and the program\u2019s certificates, which also incorporate Google\u2019s colors. The curriculum features cartoon robots that resemble the company\u2019s Android robot icon. To some observers, the game is essentially a big ad for Google.David Monahan, campaign manager at the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a nonprofit advocacy group, likened the program to asking Budweiser to talk to parents and children about underage drinking.\u201cThere is an increasing awareness of the fact that all these supposedly free platforms are not free and that all of us are being tracked and our information is really the commodity we\u2019re paying,\u201d Mr. Monahan said. \u201cThis seems like the wrong time to be pushing resources that tell kids to be brave and fearless on the internet without telling them to be cautious and without giving them the information they really need.\u201d\u201cWe are helping them become more knowledgeable about what the digital landscape is like,\u201d Mr. Hodgson said of his students, \u201cso they can make choices about what they use and what they don\u2019t use.\u201dMs. Yi of Google said the company was aware that multiple efforts were needed to help children learn to navigate the digital world. In addition to \u201cBe Internet Awesome,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019ve also built products like Family Link, which lets parents supervise their kids\u2019 Google accounts; have hosted online safety school assemblies for years; and will continue to develop new tools and resources for kids, parents and educators.\u201dAmerican corporate giants are no strangers to the country\u2019s schools.\u201cThe best solution would be for this kind of training to be undertaken by an organization less invested in how consumers conceive of privacy on the internet,\u201d the authors of the journal article wrote. \u201cAt the very least, \u2018Be Internet Awesome\u2019 should have significantly less Google branding.\u201d But even teachers like Mr. Hodgson, who uses Google tools with his students, are leery of the company\u2019s presence in schools.\u201cMaybe it has some good for the public if you use it in certain ways,\u201d he said of the \u201cBe Internet Awesome\u201d program.

She\u2019s facing a Republican incumbent whose popularity has tumbled recently.Supported byBARRE, Vt. \u2014 Christine Hallquist is the first transgender person to be nominated for governor by a major party, and she knows people are interested in hearing her life story. She is more than happy to tell it, but the thing she really wants to talk about is the electric grid.\u201cThe foundation of all humanity, way back to the beginning, has been energy,\u201d she said, walking outside the Washington County Treatment Court, a drug-treatment program, on a brisk fall day. \u201cThe rise and fall of empires has been based on energy.\u201dBack then, she would retreat after school to the attic of her home in rural New York to relax, pick an outfit from her hidden stash of women\u2019s clothes and tinker beneath the eaves on homemade electrical circuits and other projects.\u201cI had my own little fortress, and it was cool. I never got caught,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was kind of like Christine\u2019s playground.\u201d\u201cMy whole life has been about understanding that most things are non-binary, including my gender,\u201d she said. \u201cSome things are really obvious, but most issues are pretty complicated, and to be self righteous and believe that you know the answer does an injustice to the issue.\u201dAs a candidate, Ms. Hallquist believes the electric grid \u2014 that vast reservoir of energy that powers everything from smartphones to sonogram machines \u2014 can, if managed correctly, fight all manner of social ills, among them rising global temperatures, rural poverty and the opioid epidemic. \u201cImmediately after the election I was like, \u2018What the hell happened?\u2019 I felt like Forrest Gump,\u201d Ms. Hallquist said. \u201cYou stumble into this historic thing and then you have to understand what it means.\u201dBut transgender rights activists said they immediately knew what it meant. \u201cThis could be truly life saving for some trans kids,\u201d said Mara Keisling, the executive director for the National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund. \u201cThat she won the nomination \u2014 or just that she got to be the C.E.O. of an electric utility \u2014 shows that transgender people can have any kind of position. Christine has been a trailblazer.\u201d\u201cWe can grow the hell out of this rural economy if we connect every home and business to fiber optic cable\u201d strung alongside power lines, which could bring high-speed internet to the state\u2019s many remote towns, she said. And by moving electricity production away from fossil fuel she believes \u201cthe electric grid could be the tool to solve climate change.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Ms. Hallquist said they have since reunited (\u201cBoth of our Facebook statuses say, \u2018It\u2019s complicated,\u2019\u201d she said), but her campaign declined to make Pat available for an interview, citing her desire for privacy. Safety is also a concern. The campaign has received roughly a dozen death threats that lead them to stop publicizing Ms. Hallquist\u2019s schedule and to assign an aide to travel with her in public. \u201cI get hecklers at parades, sometimes people say things like, \u2018What\u2019s his problem?\u2019 or, \u2018I\u2019m not voting for that,\u2019 but I don\u2019t let it bother me,\u201d Ms. Hallquist said outside the venue. \u201cVermonters have welcomed me with open arms.\u201d(Others on the right have been more derisive, including The Daily Caller, a conservative website that used male pronouns to refer to Ms. Hallquist in an article on her primary victory.)After she won, she kept her team in place rather than hire consultants from out-of-state. \u201cEmotional commitment will more than compensate for what you don\u2019t know,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the key things about Vermont is you can\u2019t get elected if you\u2019re not nice.\u201dPerhaps with that in mind, Ms. Hallquist said she \u201cabhors\u201d labels. When asked to describe herself politically, she declined to use words like \u201cprogressive\u201d or \u201cliberal\u201d in favor of \u201cpragmatic, loving and decent.\u201dBeneath that sentiment is an independent streak that can sometimes irk supporters. Over three days of interviews last month, she occasionally bemoaned \u201cextreme progressives\u201d and the \u201cpurity tests\u201d of social media \u201cthought police\u201d who criticized her as insufficiently leftist for accepting the endorsement of Mr. Biden.And as exciting as Ms. Hallquist\u2019s campaign has been for many transgender people, she has also faced criticism in the past for some of her statements on L.G.B.T. issues.Brenda Churchill, 61, an L.G.B.T. activist who also works for the campaign, described those tensions as a byproduct of the many generations contained within the wider transgender community. \u201cDid she get into any kind of pitched battle with folks?

{"Headline": "An Azerbaijani Feast Awaits in Brooklyn, if You Can Find It", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRestaurant ReviewDuring the five years Village Cafe has been open, I must have driven the length of Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn a dozen times without noticing it. At best I might have spotted the tiny parking lot in Midwood, with tattered red, blue and silver streamers flapping over its 10 or so spaces, giving it the appearance of the world\u2019s smallest used-car dealership. In the back is a wide, single-story structure that looks like the trailer office where you would sit down to discuss loan options with Marty from financing.But that building is an Azerbaijani restaurant that stands out among the dining outposts of former Soviet republics that stretch north from Brighton Beach, and each time I\u2019ve gone inside I was given not a credit check, but a test of my appetite\u2019s limits. This is not just because almost every platter of food that leaves the kitchen at Village Cafe seems intended to feed an actual village. I run into trouble because there are so many things I want to order and so few things I am willing to leave on the table as the meal winds down.There will never be a time when I go to Village Cafe and decide not to have at least one qutab, if not all three. The menu gives the name of this delicate Azerbaijani flatbread, the diameter of a pita but thinner, as kutaby. Either way, it is very good when stuffed with minced, quietly spiced chicken or lamb. It is exceptional when filled with greens: spinach, scallions, and dill and cilantro, two fresh herbs that turn up again and again in Azerbaijani cooking.I will always want the crimped dumplings, the size and shape of chicken drumettes, that the English menu calls ravioli and the servers call pelmeni. Filled with chicken or lamb, these dumplings can be boiled, but the urge to ask for them fried is overwhelming, and the fried ones are better dunked in the tomato-pepper sauce that I would call salsa if I were not in an Azerbaijani restaurant.There will be liver on my table, too. Maybe it will be Turkish style, little fried cubes under a tart purple dusting of ground sumac. Or the liver may be added to bits of lamb hearts, kidney and testicles, and cooked with onions and potato cubes in a fantastically oily hash called djiz biz.Whether I will eat guru hingal will depend on how far in advance I\u2019ve planned my meal, because it generally has to be ordered a day ahead. It is a noodle dish: very thin, wide sheets of pasta under a sauce of onions and ground lamb fried in its own fat until it is magnificently crunchy. If you poured chile oil over guru hingal, it would taste Sichuanese; stew the lamb with tomatoes and you could mistake the sauce for Bolognese. But it\u2019s from Azerbaijan, and it\u2019s good with yogurt.And I will have soup, even if nobody else does, because Village Cafe\u2019s kitchen understands how to make it. The kufta-bozbash is a strong, well-skimmed lamb broth with chickpeas and a single, tender lamb-rice meatball, as big as an apple. The broth for dushbara soup is similar, but the ballast is provided by miniature lamb dumplings about the size of M&Ms. Cilantro and dried mint are added to both soups at the last minute, and the mint is especially helpful.Village Cafe\u2019s hot borscht, strong and decidedly unvegetarian, outperforms some I\u2019ve had in Brighton Beach. Instead of sour cream, it comes with a spoonful of yogurt. The cuisine of Azerbaijan often echoes those of its neighbors Georgia, Armenia and Iran, but other dishes, like borscht, were hauled down from Eastern Europe in the strong arms of Mother Russia. We can also thank Russia for the insane music videos that play on Village Cafe\u2019s two televisions, typically with the volume off while American pop of the \u201980s plays on the sound system.You sit at what appear to be varnished picnic tables with chairs instead of benches. The rest of the d\u00e9cor looks like a Brighton Beach yard sale: a mushroom cookie jar, an embroidered peasant smock, a camouflage cap, a samovar or two, a collection of beaded handbags, several ceramic cows, three statues of fat chefs with toques and mustaches, and two giant forks mounted on the wall.For atmosphere, Village Cafe is roundly beaten by my second-favorite Azerbaijani restaurant in Brooklyn, Old Baku in Kensington. Walk past the awning that says \u201cprivate club,\u201d past the curtained booths in the front dining room, past the open kitchen where chefs scoop burning coals to keep the fire under the kebabs going strong, and you enter a courtyard from another country. Almost everybody at Old Baku is smoking under the arbor of grape vines that weave around strings of white lights. If you go in the fall, you might be brought a plate of purple grapes, newly picked a few feet away.But Village Cafe gains its edge on Old Baku in the kitchen. The stewed fruit ladled over saffron rice in its plov, for instance, is a richer and more varied compilation of dried plums, apricots, chestnuts and deeply browned lamb.Main course names incline toward the allusive as well, with one chicken cutlet called \u201cMiracle of Village\u201d and another \u2014 buried under a white pillow of cheese and cream sauce \u2014 that goes by \u201cMother In Laws Chicken.\u201dBut really, the best place to go once all the amenities have been polished off is the kebabs. The quail may be a bit wizened. The grilled testicles with a hint of lemon in their lightly browned surfaces will always be a niche proposition. But the lamb ribs, the marinated lamb chops known as chalahac and the flatbread-wrapped Azerbaijani version of kofte called lulya kebabs (made from chicken or lamb) are extremely good. The vegetable skewer choices begin and end with blistered tomatoes and softly collapsing eggplant. Both are worthwhile. So is the side dish called \u201chomemade potatoes,\u201d if there is any room left on the table. Sliced and fried with onions, they narrowly beat out the pretty good fries.A cup or two of strong dark tea will speed your recovery from this onslaught. Dessert may not. Still, there is something to be said for trying a Napoleon made like baklava and a baklava made like a Napoleon.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Illinois Governor\u2019s Race Turned Into One of the Most Expensive in the Country", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 In a political climate in which invective and vitriol have become the norm, the race to become governor of Illinois still sticks out for its rancor. But the bitter tenor and record-shattering money being spent here by two ultra-wealthy men have little to do with the political turbulence in Washington.It has more to do with toilets.In the Democratic corner is J.B. Pritzker, an entrepreneur and billionaire heir to the Hyatt Hotels fortune, who has contributed eye-popping amounts of his own money to the race. On the Republican side, the incumbent, Bruce Rauner, a multimillionaire former private equity executive, is seeking a second term. In all, about $244 million has flowed into their campaigns \u2014 and counting.Mr. Pritzker has other problems, too. That\u2019s where plumbing comes in: This month, Mr. Pritzker paid $330,000 to county government after a leaked inspector general report found that tax break claims on a mansion he owned had been part of a \u201cscheme to defraud.\u201d The report included emails indicating that Mr. Pritzker\u2019s wife, M.K. Pritzker, had instructed contractors to disconnect toilets in one of the family\u2019s side-by-side mansions in Chicago\u2019s Gold Coast neighborhood while it was under renovation so that it could be declared uninhabitable. This way, it avoided steep taxes. Galia Slayen, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pritzker, said no laws were broken regarding the tax breaks.The toilet revelations were only among the latest in a series of battering claims \u2014 over taxes, race, wealth, labor unions, and oversight of a state-run veterans home \u2014 in a bruising campaign. The race has packed the airwaves with ads and has left some voters, even in a place that\u2019s accustomed to political rough and tumble, in something of a daze.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen this, at all, in any race,\u201d Ewell Wallace, a Chicago resident, said on a recent day. Mr. Wallace, who is 53 and works in information technology, said he preferred Mr. Pritzker \u2014 by a very slim margin. \u201cI would look to the governor\u2019s race and think the campaign should be a little more classy, but it\u2019s all really rotten right now.\u201dThe sheer size of spending on the race is enormous, though so far it remains shy of the record set in the 2010 campaign for governor of California. Of Mr. Pritzker\u2019s approximately $165 million campaign war chest, about $162 million has come from his own pocket, according to public filings with the Illinois State Board of Elections. That puts Mr. Pritzker\u2019s self-funding among the highest for a governor\u2019s race, approaching Meg Whitman\u2019s record, adjusted for inflation, in that 2010 California governor\u2019s race, which she lost. Without adjusting for inflation, Mr. Pritzker\u2019s self-funding tops Ms. Whitman\u2019s.Mr. Rauner\u2019s total is approximately $80 million, of which about $58 million is his own money.J.B. Pritzker and Bruce Rauner, the two candidates for Illinois governor, are among the top self-funders since 2000.

Lisa Madigan, the outgoing Democratic attorney general, is looking into whether the administration\u2019s handling of the outbreak violated any laws or contributed to the deaths.In public statements, Mr. Rauner has denied there was any slowdown in the response.The various scandals crested earlier this month in a debate on stage at the Quincy Community Theatre, where Mr. Rauner and Mr. Pritzker faced off in tones that would not have seemed out of place on a late-night sketch show.\u201cSimple fact, four of my nine predecessors as governor went to jail,\u201d Mr. Rauner said at one point. \u201cMr. Pritzker has a very good chance of being No. 5.\u201d Mr. Pritzker responded by accusing the governor of a \u201ccover-up\u201d concerning the veterans home outbreak.As Election Day has neared, new accusations have emerged, along with punches and counterpunches.Last week, 10 current and former members of Mr. Pritzker\u2019s campaign staff filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Latino and black staff members had been treated differently from their white counterparts. The suit said black workers had been \u201cherded into race-specific positions where they are expected to interact with the public, offered no meaningful chance for advancement, and receive less favorable treatment than their white counterparts.\u201dMr. Pritzker\u2019s campaign denied the allegations, saying that they were part of an extortion attempt; the campaign shared a letter the workers sent seeking $7.5 million in punitive damages before filing the suit. \u201cThe incidents listed in this complaint are baseless and make offensive claims,\u201d Juliana Stratton, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor and Mr. Pritzker\u2019s running-mate, said in a statement.\u201cHe\u2019s clearly a phony, clearly a fraud on this,\u201d Mr. Rauner said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t care about union workers. He cares about himself and protecting a few hundred thousand dollars of his inheritance.\u201dPresident Trump has said little about the governor\u2019s race here, even as Chicago \u2014 in particular the intractable problem of its gun violence \u2014 has been a regular subject of his public conversation.In the past, Mr. Rauner criticized Mr. Trump for his stances on matters like the racially-charged clashes in Charlottesville, Va., and he also expressed misgivings about the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.But as distressing polling numbers have continued to arrive, Mr. Rauner has struck tones not unlike the president\u2019s. In a debate hosted by the Chicago Sun-Times, Mr. Rauner appeared to link undocumented immigrants with the city\u2019s problems with violence. \u201cOne of the reasons we have such high unemployment in the city of Chicago and so much crime is the massive number of illegal immigrants here take jobs away from American citizens and Chicago citizens,\u201d Mr. Rauner said.Rachel Shorey contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

For years, these platforms captured Mr. Sayoc\u2019s attention with a steady flow of outrage and hyperpartisan clickbait and gave him a public venue to declare his allegiance to Mr. Trump and his antipathy for the president\u2019s enemies.On social media, none of this behavior is particularly out of the ordinary. In fact, to many of his followers, Mr. Sayoc may have appeared to be just one of many partisan keyboard warriors working through their rage.\u201cThere are tons of people like this,\u201d said Shannon McGregor, an assistant professor of communication at the University of Utah who studies social media. \u201cHe took these memes to their most violent extreme, but this is a pretty big world on social media.\u201dThe genesis of Mr. Sayoc\u2019s partisan awakening may never be known, but hints of it first appeared on his Facebook feed in early 2016, as the primary season for the presidential election was starting.That February, he posted a link to a conspiracy theory video on YouTube titled, \u201cIs Barack Obama THE ANTICHRIST \u2014 100% PROOF Is There!\u201d Days later, he posted a second YouTube video, \u201cSatan Sent Obama to Destroy America,\u201d and a clip featuring Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, which was called, \u201cMUST HEAR: Sean Exposes Illegal Immigrant Crime Stats.\u201d He posted several anti-Obama videos multiple times on his feed, interspersed with stories about personal finance and his favorite soccer players.By the summer, Mr. Sayoc\u2019s social media activity was all politics, all the time.On Facebook, he posted stories from Infowars, World Net Daily, Breitbart and other right-wing websites. His posts, which rarely included commentary apart from the links, showed a fascination with Islamist terrorism, illegal immigration and anti-Clinton conspiracy theories. (On one post, a YouTube link, he wrote: \u201cThe Clinton have funneled two billion dollars through Clinton foundation.\u201d)In October, a month before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Sayoc posted a series of photos of himself at a Trump campaign rally, watching from the crowd in a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat.Despite his prolific posting, Mr. Sayoc does not appear to have gained a wide audience. His Twitter account was followed by fewer than 1,200 people as of Friday morning, and although he had nearly 3,000 friends on Facebook, many of his posts were never commented on or shared.He did, however, display an unusual tendency to post stories and images over and over again, sometimes dozens of times.But while Mr. Sayoc may have been an outlier in frequency, the content he posted resembled the kind of highly charged outrage bait that is a staple of partisan internet circles. On social platforms, where polarized content is often better at generating engagement than nuanced conversations, there can be a temptation to veer into more extreme territory to stand out.\u201cPeople find people with similar interests, and it naturally leads them to encounters and relationships and information they wouldn\u2019t necessarily find offline,\u201d Mr. Albright said. \u201cBeing able to find similar communities can really lead you down a path of radicalization.\u201dFor years, many of Mr. Sayoc\u2019s posts simply reshared existing images, links and videos. But in recent months, he began to create more of his own posts. He began posting less on Facebook and dialed up his efforts on Twitter, where he could engage directly with his political heroes and foes.In March, he cheered on Republican tax policies, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t have pay taxes on bonus yea Trump Trump Trump.\u201dIn June, he tweeted a birthday card to Mr. Trump and wrote: \u201cHappy Birthday to greatest gift from God President Trump Trump Trump. The greatest result President ever and economy for all American Soaring 2016-2024 Trump Trump Trump.\u201dAnd on Twitter, he began to attack prominent liberals, especially those who had either criticized or been criticized by Mr. Trump.He called Lena Dunham, the outspoken creator of \u201cGirls\u201d on HBO, \u201cHollywood slime\u201d and told her to \u201cstick your show where sun doesn\u2019t shine.\u201dHe became obsessed with David Hogg, a student who survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Florida and had become a prominent advocate for gun control. He tweeted out dozens of photos of Mr. Hogg, accusing him of being a \u201cfake fraud\u201d and being paid by the billionaire George Soros, a benefactor of liberal causes and a frequent target of the right.In recent months, Mr. Sayoc\u2019s behavior changed. His posts took on a darker, more obsessive tone, often accompanied by threats of violence and gory images of bloody animal carcasses. No longer mistakable as an everyday internet partisan, he posted repeatedly about \u201cunconquered Seminoles,\u201d a reference to the tribe that he appears to have adopted. (It also appeared on his van.) And on Twitter, his messages turned dark and sinister.He directed a tweet at Ms. Waters, the California Democrat, with a photo of what appeared to be her house. The message read: \u201csee you soon.\u201dHe sent another to Eric H. Holder Jr., an attorney general under Mr. Obama, that read, \u201cSee u soon Tick Tock.\u201d And he told Zephyr Teachout, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for attorney general in New York, that he had a surprise waiting for her. \u201cWe Unconquered Seminole Tribe have a special Air boat tour lined up for you here in our Swamp Everglades,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSee u real soon. Hug your loved ones.\u201d\u201cWe are deeply sorry for that error,\u201d Twitter added.Mr. Sayoc continued to post unabated until as recently as Wednesday, even as the authorities were conducting a manhunt for the sender of the explosives that had been mailed to prominent Democrats. He sent a tweet to the Twitter account at the website TMZ that criticized Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor in Florida, for raising campaign funds from Mr. Soros and other liberal donors.\u201c$500,000 Soros puppet,\u201d read the text over the image.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "G.E. Ousts Chief Just Over a Year After Picking Him to Lead a Turnaround", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen John Flannery was named chief executive of General Electric last year, he said he would rethink the troubled business \u201cwith speed, urgency and no constraints.\u201d In the next months, he sharply cut expenses and devised a plan to sell off large parts of the industrial giant.But that wasn\u2019t enough. On Monday, G.E. announced that it had replaced Mr. Flannery with H. Lawrence Culp Jr., who joined the company\u2019s board in April.The switch stunned analysts, since the industrial giant traditionally measured its leaders\u2019 longevity by the decade. Jack Welch, the famed G.E. chief, led the company for 20 years, and Mr. Flannery\u2019s predecessor, Jeffrey R. Immelt, was chief executive for 16 years.It also underscored the depths of problems at G.E., once considered a model of management excellence. In addition to the leadership switch, the company said on Monday that it would \u201cfall short\u201d of its earnings guidance for the year and would write down the value of its struggling power generation business by about $23 billion \u2014 the latest in a series of disappointments for investors.Mr. Flannery, who had worked at G.E. for more than three decades, was told of the board\u2019s decision over the weekend, the person said.G.E. shares, which had been down more than 50 percent in the past year, rose 7 percent on Monday.Mr. Culp, 55, is a former chief executive of Danaher, a conglomerate that makes scientific, medical and automotive equipment. During his 14 years as its leader, ending in 2014, Danaher was known for its lean management, deal making and outstanding financial performance.In a statement, Mr. Culp gave no hint that G.E. would change strategy. He called G.E. \u201ca fundamentally strong company\u201d facing an uphill but achievable turnaround challenge.G.E. has been battered by a series of shocks over the last decade. When the financial crisis hit, G.E., the nation\u2019s largest nonbank financial institution at the time, was caught in the credit crunch and its future cast in doubt. Mr. Immelt moved to drastically pare back its big finance arm, GE Capital.Mr. Flannery\u2019s recovery plan was to move G.E. away from its conglomerate past. The company would shed its large oil and gas, health care and rail locomotive businesses. It would focus on three others: jet engines, electric power generators and wind turbines. The remaining three accounted for 60 percent of G.E.\u2019s revenue of $122 billion last year.Mr. Culp was on the board and approved the company\u2019s strategic plan in June. So was Thomas W. Horton, a former chief executive of American Airlines, who was named the company\u2019s lead director on Monday.But the power generation business has continued to spawn problems. Two weeks ago, G.E. disclosed that it had a failure in a couple of its electricity-generating gas turbines and that they had to be temporarily shut down.In a statement at the time, Russell Stokes, president of G.E.\u2019s power business, characterized the problem as showing that \u201cminor adjustments will be made along the way with any new technology.\u201d The turbine blade problem, he said, was being fixed quickly.But the board apparently saw the incident as a red flag in a business that delivered a series of worrying surprises for more than a year, dragging down G.E.\u2019s profit performance and its stock price.The board held a meeting Wednesday to review the issues in G.E.\u2019s power division, according to the person familiar with the deliberations. On Friday, Mr. Flannery, in an in-house video, addressed the struggles of the power unit and encouraged its work force to \u201ckeep your head up, your chin up, keep moving forward.\u201dThe huge write-off in the power unit \u2014 a noncash charge \u2014 essentially erases all the good-will value in the business. Good will is the value attributed to a business beyond its basic assets, like factories and equipment. So good will typically includes the value of a brand name, customer accounts and patented technology.G.E. is by no means the only company grappling with a weak market for power generators, as energy-efficiency programs and renewable energy sources reduce demand. But G.E. misjudged the market badly, more than rivals like Siemens.The big write-down and the rock-bottom valuation, analysts say, suggest that the G.E. board was not confident that the power business was on a recovery path. Under Mr. Flannery, the nasty surprises continued, and the board was unforgiving.\u201cFlannery was the best internal, pragmatic candidate for the job, but this board wasn\u2019t waiting long to see how he did,\u201d said Nicholas Heymann, an analyst at William Blair & Company.G.E. has repeatedly said its power business, while a fix-it project for the next year or so, is a fundamentally sound business with industry-leading technology and a large customer base. About one-third of the world\u2019s electricity is generated by G.E. equipment.The logic behind keeping the power business also hinges on technology. A gas turbine that generates electricity, experts note, is very much like a jet engine \u2014 except it is larger and bolted to the floor of a utility plant.In his statement, Mr. Culp declared that the task ahead for G.E. was \u201cto drive superior execution, and we will move with urgency.\u201dThe words are essentially the same ones Mr. Flannery voiced again and again. But now, they come not from a 30-year G.E. veteran but from an outsider. Under Mr. Culp, analysts expect the words to be backed by even more forceful action.\u201cFlannery seemed a smart, common-sense guy, but he was an insider,\u201d Scott Davis, chief executive of Melius Research, an independent financial analysis firm, wrote in a report on Monday. \u201cAnd as an insider, he was slow to make the difficult decisions,\u201d like shedding even more of his former colleagues from the G.E. payroll to reduce expenses.Stephen Grocer contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "On the Ballot This Year: A Lot to Think About", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Politics With Lisa LererHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.Happy Halloween!We\u2019re six days away from Election Day, and the Florida ballot might just be the stuff of nightmares. First come the tight races for Senate, House and governor. Then, a slew of local races \u2014 everything from Statehouse to school board.And then, finally, comes the parade of ballot measures \u2014 13 in total.Among other issues, Florida voters will decide on whether to permit casinos, ban vaping in indoor workplaces, restore felon voting rights, end a certain kind of betting on greyhound dog racing, increase the judicial retirement age to 75, mandate death benefits for emergency medical workers and increase the amount of home value exempted from property tax.Whew.Floridians are hardly alone. When voters across the country head to the polls, they will be deciding not just on candidates but on a long list of complex policy issues \u2014 the majority added to the ballot through efforts by voters and advocacy groups.Over the past two years, there\u2019s been an explosion in the number of citizen-crafted initiatives that end up on the ballot, as voters frustrated with deadlocked government take legislating into their own hands.Some of the measures, like an effort in North Carolina to create a constitutional right to hunt and fish, seem designed by political parties to drive their voters to the polls. Others, like the push to legalize marijuana, are the result of persistent political movements.In total, 69 of the 155 statewide measures on the ballot this year are citizen-initiated, according to Ballotpedia. That\u2019s a slight dip from two years ago, when 71 citizen initiatives were on the ballot.But it\u2019s a significant increase from the past few decades, says Mr. Altic. From 1980 through 2014, an average of 54 citizen initiatives appeared on the ballot.The biggest topic this year is election policy. Twenty measures in 15 states would reshape redistricting, voting requirements, ballot access, campaign finance and ethics. Taxes, marijuana, Medicaid expansion and Marsy\u2019s Law, which expands the rights of crime victims, are also popular proposals.The campaigns around the initiatives can cost serious cash. A single California proposition that would limit profits for dialysis companies has attracted nearly $110 million in spending.They can also reverberate down the ticket. California Republicans have been fairly blatant in their strategy to use a gas tax repeal measure to drive conservatives to the polls. And in North Carolina, Republicans hope the hunting and fishing mandate, along with a proposal requiring an ID to vote, will juice turnout.Governors and state legislatures are pushing back, using a variety of tactics to overturn, diminish or declare unconstitutional initiatives put on the ballot by the same voters who elected them. This year, 10 citizen-initiated measures were taken off the ballot before November.____________________Here\u2019s some of what we found:\u2022 The percentage of candidates who are white men is the lowest it\u2019s been in the last four elections.\u2022 More than a quarter of all the candidates running this year are female, including 84 women of color \u2014 a 42 percent increase from just two years ago. There are at least 215 candidates of color, and a record 26 openly L.G.B.T. candidates \u2014 more than five times the number in 2010.\u2022 Among Democratic candidates, white men are actually a minority, making up just 41 percent of candidates for Congress and governor this year.\u2022 Despite all the diversity, white men will remain a majority. Women and candidates of color will most likely make up close to a third of Congress and governor\u2019s mansions next year, which is about the same as now. Winning all of the races that are considered competitive would increase their share to nearly 40 percent.____________________You can see all our polling here.____________________________________________________________Note: In yesterday\u2019s newsletter, we left the credit off our lead artwork.

{"Headline": "Michael Lewis Makes a Story About Government Infrastructure Exciting", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The Times\u201cMany of the problems our government grapples with aren\u2019t particularly ideological,\u201d Lewis writes, by way of moseying into what his book is about. He identifies these problems as the \u201cenduring technical\u201d variety, like stopping a virus or taking a census. Lewis is a supple and seductive storyteller, so you\u2019ll be turning the pages as he recounts the (often surprising) experiences of amiable civil servants and enumerating risks one through four (an attack by North Korea, war with Iran, etc.) before you learn that the scary-sounding \u201cfifth risk\u201d of the title is \u2014 brace yourself \u2014 \u201cproject management.\u201dFor the most part, though, he keeps the narrative moving, rendering even the most abstruse details of government risk assessment in the clearest (and therefore most terrifying) terms. He asks a handful of former public servants, now living as private civilians, what they fear might happen if Trump continues his haphazard approach to staffing the federal government. Their answers include an accidental nuclear catastrophe and the privatization of public goods, like government loans and drinking water.One danger to the proper functioning of federal agencies is a combination of incompetence and neglect. Lewis reports how the Trump team filled jobs at the Department of Agriculture with a number of decidedly nonagricultural nonexperts, including a country-club cabana attendant and the owner of a scented-candle company.But this kind of bumbling patronage, according to Lewis, is only one part of the Trump method. The other involves bringing in what looks suspiciously like a wrecking crew. Trump has repeatedly placed essential agencies under the leadership of individuals who have previously called for the elimination of the same agency, or else a radical limit to its authority.Take, for example, Barry Myers, Trump\u2019s nominee for the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Myers also happens to be chief executive of AccuWeather, his family\u2019s company. As a private citizen, Myers lobbied to prevent NOAA\u2019s National Weather Service from having direct contact with the public, saying that \u201cthe government should get out of the forecasting business\u201d \u2014 despite the fact that AccuWeather repackaged free government weather data and sold it for a profit.With Myers in charge, Lewis says \u201cthe dystopic endgame is not difficult to predict: the day you get only the weather forecast you pay for.\u201dLewis leavens all the doomsaying with some (darkly) funny bits. A woman astronaut recalls that male NASA technicians were so flummoxed by the prospect of menstruation in space that they offered her a kit of a hundred tampons for a short journey. The wrappers had been removed and the tampons sealed in little red cases, strung together in an \u201cendless unfurling\u201d that she likened to a \u201cbad stage act.\u201dWhat Lewis doesn\u2019t do is delve too deeply into politics, preferring instead to focus our attention on technical functions of government that everyone takes for granted. This tack will undoubtedly make the book more appealing to some of the government skeptics (i.e. conservatives) who are traditionally part of his enormous audience, but it also leaves the book with an analytical weakness. As Lewis\u2019s narrow depiction of Christie inadvertently shows, technical know-how isn\u2019t nearly enough. You can have a detailed understanding of the technocratic workings of government and still be, politically speaking, extremely unhelpful to the public you\u2019re supposed to serve.Lewis undoubtedly knows this, and as a storyteller he had to put limits somewhere. Besides, when the polar ice caps melt and the world is in flames, Democrat, Republican \u2014 none of that will matter anymore. Lewis himself seems to swing from civic optimism to abject nihilism, sometimes within the same perfect sentence. As he says about the imposing, brutalist building that houses the Department of Energy: \u201cIt will make an excellent ruin.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Other Republican Candidates Struggle Financially, Trump Stockpiles Cash", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Donald J. Trump\u2019s first campaign finance report in July 2015 revealed a shoestring operation run by a handful of loyalists working from a two-room suite in Trump Tower and funded almost entirely by $1.8 million in loans from the candidate.More than three years later, the picture is starkly different. Reports filed this week show that President Trump sits atop a sophisticated data-driven fund-raising machine that has already brought in more than $106 million \u2014 a majority of which came from small donors, with none coming from Mr. Trump\u2019s own pocket \u2014 and has spent more on his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats, $2 million, than his 2016 effort had spent on the entire campaign in its first report.Even after the costly investments in digital advertising, data analytics and other tools of modern campaigning, the three committees that make up Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign apparatus entered this month with a remarkable $47 million in the bank, according to their filings with the Federal Election Commission.That far surpasses the early nest eggs accrued by previous first-term presidents in the modern campaign finance era \u2014 none of whom had even started raising re-election money before their first midterm elections \u2014 and it gives Mr. Trump a huge lead over any prospective rivals.Mr. Trump, they argue, does not need the money now as much as the party\u2019s congressional candidates, both because he will not face voters again for more than two years, and because he won his 2016 campaign more by relying on his megarallies and Twitter feed than on pricey campaign infrastructure.Even some of Mr. Trump\u2019s defenders admit that his brisk early fund-raising and spending may be more about self-preservation than about bolstering the party.\u201cIt was important for the president to build this massive operation for his re-election to demonstrate that it would be a fool\u2019s errand for anyone inside the party to try to primary him, and because we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen in the House with a possible impeachment,\u201d Mr. Nunberg said.But he also said that \u201cone of the reasons that Republicans have been outraised, particularly in the House, is because of the massive amount of money going to the president. That could flip a seat or two.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s political team said he had been crisscrossing the country appearing at dozens of rallies with candidates in key swing states and districts, most of which have included a fund-raising component.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign committees have footed the bills for those rallies, spending more than $2.1 million on expenses related to them, according to the filings with the election commission.And he has headlined fund-raisers for the National Republican Congressional Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. His political team estimates that his efforts have yielded more than $100 million for Republican candidates for House, Senate and governor, though there is no way to independently corroborate that claim through election commission records.The records show that two joint committees that Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign formed with the Republican National Committee \u2014 Trump Victory and Trump Make America Great Again \u2014 have transferred more than $21 million to the national party and Republican state party committees to help with the midtermsBut that is substantially less than the $35 million that the joint committees have transferred to Mr. Trump\u2019s own campaign.Compared with past presidents, Mr. Trump\u2019s fund-raising efforts \u2014 which also include appearing at events for unlimited-money outside groups formed to help advance his agenda and allies \u2014 appear to be weighted more toward his own political ends than his party\u2019s, said Michael J. Malbin, the executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that analyzes campaign fund-raising and spending.\u201cIt is not unusual for presidents to focus on their own political needs and interests, but I do not remember past presidents being quite so focused before their first midterm,\u201d Mr. Malbin said. \u201cGiven the importance of majority control to his future agenda, I would have expected the balance to lean more heavily toward the key tossup races for the Senate and House.\u201dMr. Trump dismissed this month the prospect that he might bear some responsibility if his party loses big in next month\u2019s midterms, asserting that his rallies and endorsements have provided more of a boost than candidates have received from past presidents.But Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who advised Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s rivals, in his 2016 bid for the White House, argued that Mr. Trump had hurt his party\u2019s fund-raising during his first year in office by repeatedly clashing with congressional Republicans.\u201cHelping congressional Republicans hasn\u2019t been a priority for Trump until the last few weeks,\u201d Mr. Conant said. \u201cNobody faults him for raising money for his re-election campaign, but if Democrats win it may be the most costly fund-raising a president\u2019s ever done.\u201dIn all, the Trump committees have spent more than $13.7 million on digital consulting, online advertising and data-related services \u2014 making that among the top areas of spending. That spending highlights the differences between Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election bid and his first campaign, which initially resisted spending heavily on political data tools that have become essential to most modern campaigns. This time around, the spending reports indicate, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign intends to focus heavily on using data to mobilize and raise money from supporters through social media, text and email targeting.And the committees have paid more than $860,000 to Mr. Trump\u2019s companies for everything from rent to catering to office supplies.Rachel Shorey contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

As humans, our bias toward denial tempts us to roll the dice, buy scratch tickets, drive fast, jump off cliffs, eat fatty food, ignore our retirement funds and generally take too many chances.We let smoke detector batteries die. We build homes in the same flood plains where our last ones were destroyed. When a monster hurricane like Michael is bearing down, some of us ignore evacuation orders thinking our grit will enable us ride it out. It happens every time.You see denial on the macro level, too. Global companies rely on risky partners only to see their supply chains snap. Power blackouts endure for weeks because no one bothered to build a resilient infrastructure. Skyscrapers go up in flames because they have flammable cladding yet no automatic sprinklers.Generally, people don\u2019t respect the power of potential disasters, and they don\u2019t adequately plan for them.Let\u2019s face it.

It\u2019s easy, but wrong, to conflate the inevitability of a natural disaster with the supposed inevitability of life and property loss. People think insurance makes you whole. (If you think that, ask a disrupted business that lost its market share to resilient competitors if it was made whole.) And: Most people are followers, thus institutionalizing the practice of denial.So, are you worried now? Probably not. Thus, humans continue to take chances. And when they get away with them, they take more chances. Conversely, when they lose, they learn. Unfortunately, they usually learn only when they lose.Our visitors feel the heat from the fire. They cringe as a two-by-four hurtles across a room in a simulated hurricane. Their bodies absorb the concussion of an explosion. When they leave, they seem converted.We need to do this kind of education in a broader way that reaches people and businesses in vulnerable communities, places that face threats from hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, flooding and wildfires.In schools, we need to weave disaster and denial stories into classes on physics, earth science psychology, engineering, finance, statistics and the building trades. We need to find ways to tell the stories of people who suffered because of their denial, and who survived because they took the right precautions and built in the proper safeguards. Communities at potential risk should bring in engineers and emergency workers to point out what could fail, wash away, freeze, rot, short-circuit, explode, shatter, cave in or burn up. \u201cSee these wedding photos?,\u201d they might say. \u201cMight as well toss them in the creek.\u201d Or: \u201cYour classic car? It will be a boat that doesn\u2019t float.\u201d Or, to a utility executive: \u201cYour power plant? Heaven forbid a storm surge comes your way.\u201dAnd governments and insurance companies should share more widely the eerily precise predictions we\u2019re getting from big data. At my company, we can, for example, pinpoint the single data center in a global company that is most likely to be underwater when a flood strikes.In other words, we should unleash the power of predictive analytics and bring it to the doorsteps of people who live in harm\u2019s way, even though they deny it. All of this education \u2014 this pre-experiencing disaster \u2014 would underscore the critical need to focus on prevention and building resilience against threats that are easier for people simply to deny. Those who have experienced a real-life disaster already understand how disruptive it can be to their lives, communities and businesses. They discover that the turmoil is usually worse than people imagine and lasts longer than they expect. They come to realize that vulnerability is a choice, as is building resilience against potential threats. Once enlightened, they choose to identify the risks they face and address them head-on.For others, the standard warnings may fall on deaf ears. But if they could pre-experience a catastrophe, perhaps they would listen up and take some precautions. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Were the Founders Against Slavery All Along?", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.It is impossible to comprehend American history without understanding slavery\u2019s role in every aspect of its early development. Eleven slaves built a wall to protect a fledgling Dutch colony in 1626. Within a century, those 11 grew to represent one in five residents of what is now Manhattan, the nation\u2019s first capital city and today\u2019s global financial capital. Ten of America\u2019s first 12 presidents were slaveholders, as were two of the nation\u2019s earliest chief justices.Slavery is at the heart of the nation\u2019s origin story. The core of our democratic institutions \u2014 from the presidency to the Congress to the courts \u2014 was shaped immeasurably by it. And yet it is one of the least understood and distorted subjects in American history. The hip-hop superstar Kanye West\u2019s bizarre remark this spring that slavery was \u201ca choice\u201d is just one of many examples. A recent report by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that a \u201cbare majority\u201d of social studies teachers said they are qualified to teach it. Educators also complained about unclear state content standards and inadequate curricular resources. The net result: High school students are virtually illiterate on the subject, and this has had severe consequences for our national life.Sometimes in plain view and often just beneath the surface, slavery rests uncomfortably in the middle of national debates about monuments, white nationalism, kneeling athletes, Donald Trump\u2019s election, policing, immigrant family separation, racial wealth disparities and so on. Its meaning and legacy are, in many ways, as fiercely contested today as was the case when the framers first debated how to make America great.Wilentz\u2019s words, at the time, struck a discordant note to the ears of many. Not only were activists on the left pushing for greater recognition of America\u2019s racist past, but a spate of recent books had been published with new evidence of slavery\u2019s indispensable role in the development of capitalism. From the very beginning, slavery was not a \u201cSouthern pathology\u201d but an essential part of a modernizing, global economy, wrote Sven Beckert, the Harvard historian and author of \u201cEmpire of Cotton: A Global History.\u201d \u201cSlave plantations, not railroads, were in fact America\u2019s first \u2018big business.\u2019\u201dSo what is the falsehood? What does Wilentz know that others have gotten so terribly wrong about the founding connection between slavery and racism? In his revealing and passionately argued book, he insists that because the framers did not sanction slavery as a matter of principle, the antislavery legacy of the Constitution has been \u201cslighted\u201d and \u201cmisconstrued\u201d for over 200 years. \u201cAlthough the framers agreed to compromises over slavery that blunted antislavery hopes and augmented the slaveholders\u2019 power,\u201d Wilentz writes, \u201cthey also deliberately excluded any validation of property in man.\u201dTo put it simply, the Constitution, as ratified in 1788, was less racist and pro-slavery than many have thought. The nation\u2019s founding document contained a fundamental antislavery ideal built into it. Enslaved people were defined legally as \u201cpersons\u201d and not property.The usual evidence for what the celebrated historian John Hope Franklin called the \u201csweeping constitutional recognition of slavery\u201d consists of the three-fifths compromise (with the enslaved counted for political representation as three-fifths of free persons), the continuation of the Atlantic slave trade until 1808 and the so-called fugitive slave clause. None of these provisions contained the actual words \u201cslave\u201d or \u201cslavery.\u201d Nowhere do these words exist in the Constitution, that is, until after the Civil War, with ratification of the 13th and 14th Amendments.Wilentz goes to great lengths and, at times, takes great pains to show how Northern antislavery delegates combined forces with some moderate Upper South delegates to ensure the United States \u201cwould not validate slavery in national law.\u201d All references to persons \u201cbound to service\u201d or \u201cheld to service\u201d were the deliberate and intentional consequence of these hard-fought efforts.Still, to critics at the time and to posterity this all looked like a hypocritical charade and a cover-up. Even those New Englanders whose professed antislavery commitments were beyond reproach, Wilentz finds, charged that \u201cthe framers had sneakily covered up their concessions to slavery with confounding euphemisms.\u201d Within weeks of the Federal Convention, Benjamin Gale, a Connecticut millowner, accused the delegates of writing a \u201cdark, intricate, artful, crafty and unintelligible\u201d document, the worst he\u2019d ever read or seen, he complained. \u201cWhy could they have not spoke out in plain terms \u2014 Negroes?\u201dOn the other hand, the inviolability of private property, then as now, meant that the most ardent pro-slavery delegates and supporters did not see subterfuge but surrender. They wanted explicit language to protect existing state slavery laws, enshrining their natural right to own human beings. Patrick Henry said he \u201csmelt a rat\u201d when he noted, as Wilentz explains, the \u201cabsence in the Constitution of any categorical guarantee to the slaveholders of their rights to property in man.\u201dThe difference between these two constitutional interpretations would shape the most consequential political debates over territorial expansion, the limits of federal power and one of the most basic questions of American democracy, whether or not blacks had any rights whites were \u201cbound to respect.\u201dAt root, the nagging question remains: What manner of nation is this?By the 1840s, Madison\u2019s secret was out, and yet slavery would continue to be a proxy for everyone\u2019s own American values, including Wilentz\u2019s. The United States, he writes, had by then become the \u201cwealthiest and most powerful slave society in the world.\u201d And neither truth nor reconciliation saved the country from a war that was the greatest hell on earth.In the end, restoring the antislavery intent of the Constitution leaves a more perplexing question at the heart of American democracy. If it is now correct to say that America\u2019s leaders got something right about racism in the beginning, why have they repeatedly gotten so much wrong ever since? That\u2019s a history lesson still desperately needing to be taught.An earlier version of this review misidentified the location of a condominium that sits atop New York\u2019s former slave market. It is on the water\u2019s edge of the East River, not the Hudson River. The review also misstated the name of the building across from the New York Stock Exchange. It is Federal Hall National Memorial, not the original Federal Hall, which was demolished in 1812.Khalil Gibran Muhammad is the Suzanne Young Murray professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study and the author of \u201cThe Condemnation of Blackness.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Like the gubernatorial candidates Andrew Gillum in Florida and Stacey Abrams in Georgia, O\u2019Rourke is running a campaign based more on inspiration than persuasion. Rather than making narrowly targeted appeals to swing segments of the existing electorate, he seeks to turn out new voters, including young people and people of color.\u201cOur contention is that if no one\u2019s ever shown up, and listened to you, and incorporated your story into why they\u2019re campaigning, and the expectations that we\u2019re setting for one another, then I wouldn\u2019t expect you to vote either,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told Smith on Saturday.So instead of centrist triangulation, O\u2019Rourke \u2014 like Abrams and Gillum \u2014 is speaking to the aspirations of his base, and betting that other voters will be won over by his honesty. He defended the right of N.F.L. players to take a knee during the national anthem to protest police killings of unarmed African-Americans, supports \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d and slams Cruz for being in the pocket of the National Rifle Association. He\u2019s campaigning in a conservative state, but refusing to let the right set the terms of debate.It helps that he seems to have the support of legions of urban and suburban women who abhor Donald Trump, some of whom, said Allison, have only recently \u201ccome out of the Democratic closet.\u201d These women \u201cknow how to fund-raise,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been doing it for their fancy charities all their lives.\u201dWhether or not O\u2019Rourke wins, he\u2019s already come close enough to let us draw some preliminary lessons from his race, building on what we learned from Trump\u2019s awful victory. The most important is that you can\u2019t measure a candidate\u2019s viability by charting his or her ideology on a graph. We live in the age of analytics, but intangible things like charisma and authenticity still matter tremendously.There, in real time, he recorded a campaign spot responding to Republican attack ads, doing four takes as viewers offered their instant feedback. \u201cWe can be defined by our fears, or we can be known by our ambitions,\u201d he said, urging voters not to see one another as Democrats or Republicans, \u201cbut as Texans, Americans and human beings.\u201d I\u2019m not nearly as confident as O\u2019Rourke that our partisan hatreds can be transcended.

{"Headline": "How Many Space Stations Does This Planet Need?", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "The Trump administration wants to shift to a capitalist free-for-all in orbit. But the readiness of commercial space outposts to take NASA\u2019s place is far from certain.Supported byNORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. \u2014 At one end of Bigelow Aerospace\u2019s factory is a mock-up of a gargantuan home for future astronauts. With a unique design \u2014 it could be packed into a rocket, then unfurled in space \u2014 it would comfortably house a dozen people as a voluminous space station or serve as a building block of a moon base.\u201cIt\u2019ll be a monster spacecraft by any current standards,\u201d said Robert T. Bigelow, the company\u2019s namesake founder, at a news conference in February.This is Olympus, named after the mythological home of the Greek gods and a measure of Mr. Bigelow\u2019s ambitions for building settlements in space.Farther down the factory floor is a long, skinny metal structure. This is a developmental version of the spine of a more modest B330 module, which the company actually plans to build. Slight in appearance compared to Olympus, it would still be much less cramped than the metal cans that make up the International Space Station.\u201cWe also want numerous providers that are competing on cost and innovation,\u201d Jim Bridenstine, the NASA administrator, said in an interview last week. \u201cWe would like to see NASA become one customer of many customers.\u201dIf commercial stations prove cheaper to operate, NASA will have more money to pursue other goals, like sending astronauts to the moon and Mars, Mr. Bridenstine said.But betting hundreds of millions of dollars on businesses that do not yet exist could turn out to be quick way to lose a fortune. And space travel remains a dangerous avocation that could kill some people who make the trip.Mr. Bigelow, who made his fortune founding Budget Suites of America, conceded earlier this year that he is not certain that he will be able to find customers for his B330s.If there is no market, \u201cthen we would pause,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would be sitting on the ground waiting for deployment if the business simply weren\u2019t there.\u201dToday, the International Space Station is the only place where people \u2014 no more than six at a time \u2014 live away from Earth. It is a technological tour de force and the most expensive thing that humanity has ever built. The 15 nations involved, led by the United States and Russia, have spent well over $100 billion over more than two decades. The United States spends $3 billion to $4 billion each year.Continuously occupied for nearly 18 years, the station serves as a test bed for studying the long-term effects of radiation and weightlessness on astronauts. NASA has become proficient at running the station, largely eliminating breakdowns like clogged toilets, balky cooling systems and crashing computers.Perhaps most remarkable, life on the International Space Station has become unremarkable: it is a home office, albeit one more than 200 miles up and traveling at 17,000 miles per hour, where astronauts work, eat, sleep, exercise, check on experiments, perform chores.Only occasionally does the crew perform activities, like a spacewalk, that truly seem out of this world.The possibility of retiring the International Space Station, part of the administration\u2019s budget request, startled many. Companies like Bigelow are years from launching their space stations, and such expensive, cutting-edge projects often slip behind schedule.Critics worry that the International Space Station might be discarded before its successors are ready. A gap without space stations would disrupt NASA\u2019s studies, as well as emerging commercial endeavors. Nouveau space station companies could go belly up if the hoped-for customers are slow to show up.While some companies are already paying to conduct modest experiments on the space station, they are heavily subsidized by the government. NASA, for instance, currently picks up the cost of sending experiments to and from space.The astronauts were carried to safety, but now the space station is short-handed and many experiments may have to be neglected. If the Russians do not quickly solve the problem, the station may be left empty of astronauts in January.Almost two decades ago, there was a commercial space station for a brief period of time. It was Russian, and an American named Jeffrey Manber ran it. Perhaps it could have succeeded \u2014 but NASA killed it.\u201cIf you wanted to work with the capitalists in space in the 1990s, you worked with the Russians,\u201d Mr. Manber said. \u201cIf you wanted to work with the socialists, you worked with NASA.\u201dAfter the breakup of the Soviet Union, the Russian space program was strapped for money and willing to consider ideas that might have seemed crazy for an ex-Communist country. Mir, the Russian space station, was seen as ramshackle and dated, about to be replaced by the bigger, better International Space Station.But Mr. Manber and other entrepreneurs in the United States saw Mir, destined to be destroyed, more as a fixer-upper. Energia, Mir\u2019s manufacturer, agreed to partner with the Americans to create MirCorp, a commercial venture that leased the station from Russia\u2019s government.The initial pitch from Energia was using the station for research, particularly on pharmaceuticals. Mr. Manber knew that possibility was at best years away.\u201cQuickly, I veered to the market that existed,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich was entertainment and media, and we could do it, because we were in control.\u201d\u201cHad that run, we would have kept Mir up there forever,\u201d Mr. Manber said.Today, Mr. Manber has carved out a successful niche in the space station ecosystem as chief executive of NanoRacks, a small Houston-based start-up. NanoRacks has simplified the process of sending experiments to the space station and also launches small satellites known as CubeSats from the station.A couple of years ago, Mr. Manber asked his engineers to look into a quirky idea that NASA had previously discarded: Could used rocket parts left in orbit after launch be converted into a low-cost space station?With advances in robotics, the prospects of doing that now appear more promising.NanoRacks, collaborating with United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin, won a NASA contract to explore the idea further, focusing on the second stage of U.L.A.\u2019s workhorse Atlas 5 rocket.The idea is to add a small robotics module between the second stage, known as a Centaur, and the satellite payload on top.Typically, when the Centaur has pushed the satellite to the desired orbit, it burns up in the atmosphere. With the NanoRacks plan, once the Centaur is done with its main mission, the robotics piece cuts holes, seals compartments and converts the fuel tanks into living quarters.They called the concept of a rocket stage-turned-habitat Ixion, after the grandfather of the Centaurs.With a bit more Greek mythology research, they realized that was not the best name. Ixion was an unsavory character \u2014 he murdered his father-in-law and later attempted to seduce Zeus\u2019 wife.Now the concept is named the NanoRacks Space Outpost Program, and the company hopes to attach one of the outposts to the International Space Station.NanoRacks again sees space tourism as an early market. Mr. Manber thinks NASA and space enthusiasts often take too narrow a view of what businesses might develop in space.\u201cI\u2019d like to arrange the first weddings in space,\u201d he said. \u201cI think space stations are extraordinarily cool, and I don\u2019t think they have been exploited.\u201dFor Mr. Manber, the key is flexibility.\u201cThe market will tell us the market,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we go with it. We\u2019re surfing.\u201dThe third major entrant in the private space station race is Axiom Space, also headquartered in Houston. It is led by Michael T. Suffredini, who ran NASA\u2019s portion of the International Space Station until he retired in 2015.\u201cThere\u2019s a bajillion reasons why that\u2019s the case,\u201d Mr. Suffredini said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of work to validate that number. It\u2019s a shocking number for us, too.\u201dLower costs open the possibility of profit. \u201cI think it\u2019s over a billion-dollar market,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m absolutely certain we can pull off our business plan,\u201d Mr. Suffredini said.He thinks he has one significant advantage over the other companies. He has actually run a space station and kept people alive in space.While Axiom, Bigelow and NanoRacks aim to one day replace the International Space Station, in the short run all three companies hope to become a bigger part of the current station.Bigelow currently has a modest expandable docked at the space station that serves as a closet and demonstrates that the technology works. NASA is preparing to issue a competition early next year for a larger commercial module at that docking port. Bigelow will suggest adding a B330. NanoRacks envisions one of its converted Centaurs.NanoRacks is pushing NASA to add a hub that would accommodate three commercial modules, enabling different companies to offer different capabilities to different customers \u2014 space hotels for the rich, autonomous factories of fiber optics, laboratories for pharmaceutical research. In time, those could expand to multiple stations in different orbits.\u201cYou cannot bank and bet on one company and one piece of hardware,\u201d he said.But not everyone is convinced the numbers add up. \u201cSpecifically, we question whether a sufficient business case exists under which private companies will be able to develop a self-sustaining and profit-making business independent of significant federal funding within the next six years,\u201d he said.Congress also has so far been skeptical of \u2014 and sometimes hostile to \u2014 the idea of retiring the space station.The leaders of the three companies also point to a danger of competition \u2014 from NASA and China.If NASA continues to subsidize research on the station, then commercial companies may not be able to compete, even if they are cheaper.\u201cHow do we make sure it\u2019s a level playing field?\u201d Mr. Manber said.Space policy experts, even those who enthusiastically hope that NASA will take a more commercial approach, hesitate to predict when putting people in space becomes economically viable for private enterprise.\u201cThere\u2019s something missing from closing the commercial business case,\u201d said Charles Miller, a former NASA official who is now president of Nexgen Space.In 2025, Mr. Miller expects there will be three space stations in orbit: the International Space Station, the Chinese station and the beginnings of a commercial one.\u201cWe\u2019ll still have raging debates about the future of the International Space Station,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It is also a vital thoroughfare for Venezuelan oil.Tankers with Venezuelan crude sail up to the Citgo refinery, while tankers carrying fuels processed in the refinery head down to the Gulf of Mexico for delivery to gas stations in Venezuela.That two-way traffic makes the refinery a lifeline for the besieged Venezuelan government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. It\u2019s a role that\u2019s now in jeopardy. As a subsidiary of the government-controlled oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, Citgo has been mortgaged to raise money.The production of the parent company, known as Pdvsa, has been hard hit by the country\u2019s turmoil. It is struggling to meet more than $1 billion in payments due in the next couple of months on its bonds and other obligations, including compensation for property it had nationalized. Trump administration sanctions are squeezing its ability to borrow.If Pdvsa defaults, its collateral \u2014 Citgo \u2014 could become prey. It would be vulnerable to a takeover by creditors, with other oil companies or private equity investors watching for the opportunity to take a stake.\u201cThe loss of Citgo would be the coup de gr\u00e2ce for Pdvsa,\u201d said Gustavo Coronel, a former member of the parent company\u2019s board. \u201cThe psychological impact for Pdvsa and the Maduro regime would be catastrophic.\u201dIt would also be a turning point for a brand whose American identity long predates its Venezuelan connection, with its iconic sign mounted above 5,300 gasoline stations and towering behind Fenway Park\u2019s outfield wall in Boston.Though bought by Pdvsa three decades ago, Citgo likes to project itself as an American company. Founded as Cities Service more than a century ago in Oklahoma, it has 6,000 employees and full-time contractors in the United States. It prides itself on community service projects, raising funds for charities like the Muscular Dystrophy Association and financing science education for public schools.The company donated $500,000 to President Trump\u2019s inaugural celebration, despite years of sour relations between Washington and Caracas.Its giant Lake Charles refinery and its refineries in Texas and Illinois produce roughly 4 percent of the nation\u2019s refined petroleum products. But Citgo is even more crucial to Venezuela. It imports 175,000 barrels of Venezuelan crude daily \u2014 nearly one of every five barrels the country exports worldwide, providing the leftist government with desperately needed dollars.\u201cCitgo is a hard-currency cash cow for Venezuela,\u201d said Ram\u00f3n Loureiro, global business development director for KBC Advanced Technologies, a consulting firm that works with Citgo.Citgo also sends roughly 29,000 barrels a day of refined fuels like gasoline back to Venezuela.For all of Citgo\u2019s American roots, Venezuelan themes abound in its modern Houston headquarters. A Venezuelan flag flies out front, and a bronze statue of three Venezuelan workers adorns the lobby. A mural depicting Venezuela\u2019s liberator, Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, decorates the hallway outside the executive suites inscribed with his motto: \u201cGod grants victory to perseverance.\u201dPerseverance is a theme repeated by Citgo\u2019s executives. \u201cIt\u2019s really business as usual,\u201d said Rick A. Esser, a Citgo vice president and chief strategy officer. \u201cWe are focused on doing the day to day every day.\u201dEvents are sorely testing that determination.Several of Citgo\u2019s most senior executives have been imprisoned in Venezuela since late last year, awaiting trial on corruption charges. Asdr\u00fabal Ch\u00e1vez, Citgo\u2019s chief executive and a cousin of former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has had his American visa revoked, forcing him to direct operations by videoconference calls.Then there is the existential threat posed by Pdvsa\u2019s debt. This month Venezuela must pay more than $840 million to holders of Pdvsa\u2019s 2020 bonds. A default would prompt a foreclosure on the bonds\u2019 collateral, 50.1 percent of the company stock of Citgo Holdings, one of Citgo\u2019s two holding companies. Lenders could then demand accelerated principal and interest payments.The Russian oil company Rosneft, which holds the other 49.9 percent stake in Citgo Holdings as collateral for a loan to Pdvsa, could also make a claim, although it is unlikely that Washington would allow a Russian state company to take a piece of the refiner.And a federal judge has authorized Crystallex, a defunct Canadian mining company, to seize shares of PDV Holding, the other holding company that formally owns Citgo, as payment for a $1.4 billion arbitration award for a government confiscation of a mine in Venezuela.(Pdvsa wholly owns PDV Holding, which holds 100 percent of Citgo Holding, which, in turn, owns all of Citgo, an arrangement that could delay a legal settlement.)There may be other claims yet to pay. Altogether, an estimated $17 billion in assets have been confiscated by the government from foreign oil, mining and manufacturing companies since Hugo Ch\u00e1vez took power in the late 1990s. There are also unpaid bills for oil-field services.What made the Crystallex decision particularly important was that it asserted that Pdvsa, and therefore Citgo, is legally indistinguishable from the Venezuelan government, and therefore a sale of assets should proceed unless Pdvsa can manage to issue a bond to cover the judgment.Pdvsa is appealing the ruling. For their part, holders of its 2020 bonds, including BlackRock and Contrarian Capital, have requested a stay on any future sale of Citgo assets pending final appeal.\u201cCitgo\u2019s integrity as a company is at stake,\u201d said Luisa Palacios, a Venezuelan energy analyst at Medley Global Advisors, a policy research firm. \u201cI don\u2019t see how Pdvsa keeps Citgo, because all of Citgo is pledged one way or another to different types of lenders and disgruntled creditors are managing to disrupt its stability.\u201dEnergy and legal analysts say the courts may eventually auction off shares of Citgo to other American oil companies and use the proceeds to pay off claims. Refinery profits are healthy, and a company like Valero might pursue an acquisition.Many oil analysts say the company is worth more split than as a whole since its three refineries are far apart. But others say it is still possible Citgo can survive intact. It could eventually be acquired as an investment by a private equity firm as a whole or in pieces if it is detached from Pdvsa in court proceedings or otherwise as part of a bankruptcy of one of its holding companies.Citgo still makes money, its executives say, and is current in its payments on its own bonds. Independent refinery analysts say the company is well maintained and could be valuable to another company or companies.The Lake Charles refinery, Citgo\u2019s largest and the sixth most productive refinery in the nation, continues to make capital improvements, including more than $20 million in new investments to increase efficiency, and more are planned to produce more gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.Jerry Dunn, general manager of the Lake Charles refinery, said Pdvsa\u2019s problems had had no significant effect on his operations. \u201cThe output of our plant hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d he said.Citgo\u2019s workers here say all the tumult is concerning, but they insist that it doesn\u2019t distract them from their jobs.\u201cWe worry about boiling oil,\u201d said Craig Barber, a maintenance supervisor. \u201cAnd as long as we are boiling oil and making money, this company will survive.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Council Will Weigh Question Mayor Ignored at His Gym", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. de Blasio walked away. \u201cI\u2019m not doing this here,\u201d he said, according to a video recording of the incident at the Prospect Park Y.M.C.A. \u201cI\u2019m in the middle of a workout.\u201dNow the woman, Nathylin Flowers Adesegun, who has lived in a homeless shelter for three years, may soon get what she wanted.Rafael Salamanca Jr., a councilman from the Bronx, will introduce legislation on Wednesday that will mandate that any rental housing project that receives taxpayer subsidies \u2014 such as tax abatements, loans, tax credits or reduced-cost land \u2014 has to set aside 15 percent of its created or preserved units for people living in the city\u2019s shelter system.But the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, said he strongly supports the concept of Mr. Salamanca\u2019s bill \u2014 an important sign that the legislation will be seriously considered by the 51-member body.\u201cI hope this sends a clear message to Mayor de Blasio that a homeless woman like me is not alone,\u201d Ms. Adesegun, 72, said \u201cand that there are elected officials in New York who are willing to fight for what\u2019s right when the mayor refuses to do so.\u201dMr. Salamanca represents the South Bronx, one of the poorest Council districts. Over the last year, he has worked with developers there on at least two affordable housing projects that increase to 15 percent the number of units set aside for the homeless, creating 48 units.\u201cWe have an affordable housing crisis that continues to ravage the city and we need to do better at getting housing for our most vulnerable families, the homeless and the very low income,\u201d Mr. Salamanca said in an interview. \u201cThe need to address the homelessness issue is so intense and dire that individuals are interrupting the mayor while he\u2019s working out to ask him to do better.\u201dMr. Johnson said that he \u201cstrongly supports\u201d increasing the number of units set aside for the homeless.\u201cHomelessness is one of the biggest issues we are grappling with as a city, and we need an all-hands-on-deck approach toward solving it,\u201d Mr. Johnson said.Although the mayor\u2019s plan generally calls for a 5 percent set-aside, since May 2017, the Department of Housing Preservation and Development has required developers on city-financed projects to earmark 10 percent of units for the homeless, according to housing officials. Some projects have set aside as much as 30 to 60 percent of the units, depending on the type of development, for the homeless.Since Mr. de Blasio took office in 2014, the city has financed the creation or preservation of 109,000 affordable units, including 8,900 homes for the homeless.\u201cI think the affordable housing plan works for the people of the city because it is for everyone. It is meant to reach working-class people, middle-class people, low-income people,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said last week at an unrelated news conference in Queens.City officials say they have taken a holistic approach to address homelessness by preventing homelessness. The city rebuilt its rental assistance program and provides legal services to tenants facing eviction.As a result, 38,000 families comprising 100,000 people have exited shelters or been prevented from entering shelters, the city said. The number of people in the city shelter system remained flat in 2017, the first time in more than a decade.\u201cI don\u2019t want to send a message that the only folks who can get affordable housing are folks who end up in shelter. I think that\u2019s wrong for everyone,\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.Increasing the minimum amount of housing for the homeless would also make it more difficult to finance affordable housing projects. In order to make affordable buildings financially sustainable, there has to be the right mix of people from all incomes, city officials said.City officials estimate that it costs $433,180 and takes five years to develop a newly built unit that is set aside for the homeless. Jaclyn Rothenberg, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said building new apartments is a \u201cmuch more expensive and slower option than providing things like rental assistance.\u201d\u201cThis bill would undermine the flexibility we need to adapt to the market and continue delivering housing for homeless New Yorkers as well as low-income New Yorkers and those on the brink of homelessness,\u201d said Matthew Creegan, a spokesman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.Giselle Routhier, policy director of the Coalition for the Homeless, an advocacy group, said the city has focused too much on the social services side of homelessness and now should focus on housing development.\u201cIf the city provides the subsidies, the developers will build,\u201d Ms. Routhier said. \u201cWe are not asking for 100 percent of the housing plan to be for the homeless but we are asking for a proportion that is commensurate with the need.\u201dIt is too early to say if Mr. de Blasio would consider vetoing the legislation were it to pass, his office said. Ms. Adesegun said she will continue to push.\u201cWe should stand as one and not leave people behind,\u201d Ms. Adesegun said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "As Storms Keep Coming, FEMA Spends Billions in \u2018Cycle\u2019 of Damage and Repair", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVANT, La. \u2014 In the exact spot where Hurricane Katrina demolished the Plaquemines Parish Detention Center, a new $105 million jail now hovers 19 feet above the marsh, perched atop towering concrete pillars. Described by a state official as the \u201cTaj Mahal\u201d of Louisiana corrections, it has so much space that one of every 27 parish residents could bunk there.But on an average day in the first half of this year, more than 40 percent of its 872 beds went unoccupied, making it one of the emptiest jails in the state, records show. And because of its isolated, flood-prone location, the jail still must be evacuated before any major storm or risk becoming an accidental Alcatraz.There is but one reason the Plaquemines jail was rebuilt on endangered land, with needless capacity, at immense cost: The sheriff wanted it that way. But unlike most new jail construction, his project did not have to be financed through bond sales or other local revenues, with voters able to hold him accountable. Rather, because the old jail was destroyed by a natural disaster, the cost was covered by federal taxpayers, through a Federal Emergency Management Agency program that is required by law to distribute billions in aid but exerts little control over how the money is spent.FEMA\u2019s public assistance program has provided at least $81 billion in this manner to state, territorial and local governments in response to disasters declared since 1992, according to a New York Times analysis of federal data. But an examination of projects across the country\u2019s ever-expanding flood zones reveals that decisions to rebuild in place, often made seemingly in defiance of climate change, have at times left structures just as defenseless against the next storm.Other efforts have required enormously expensive engineering to ensure protection. Yet in some instances, restrictions on construction in flood plains have effectively prohibited FEMA from safeguarding its multimillion-dollar investments in new and repaired public buildings.Local officials desperate to restore normalcy to disoriented communities will get to decide how to spend those federal dollars \u2014 choices made more consequential, and costly, as sea levels rise and Atlantic storms generate greater surge and rainfall because of climate change. What once seemed random climatic misfortune now occurs more predictably. Coastal scientists and disaster recovery experts agree that if rebuilding in the same place once dared lightning to strike twice, it now tempts a more certain fate.For evidence, visit Princeville, N.C., a town of 2,000 on the Tar River. In 1999, a hurricane named Floyd engorged the river until it spilled over a levee, ruining the town hall, Princeville Elementary School, the police and fire station, the senior center and virtually every other structure.\u201cI thought, \u2018Once in a lifetime,\u2019\u201d said Mayor Bobbie Darnell Jones, who was rescued from his house by helicopter.Leaders of the town, which was settled by newly emancipated slaves, rejected suggestions from state officials to move the entire community to higher ground. Instead, FEMA spent more than $5 million in public assistance grants to clear debris, build a new town hall and school, repair other buildings and replace fire trucks, a garbage truck, even a riding lawn mower, the agency\u2019s records show.Since at least 1950, an empathetic nation has supported the impulse to rebuild in place by financing much of the cost of disaster recovery through the federal budget. But the process adheres to the American conviction that, regardless of who pays, decisions about land use and infrastructure should be made as locally as possible.With local officials often incentivized to replicate the past, experts in disaster relief say changes in federal law and regulations may be needed to reorient the system to reflect climate realities.Grants have gone to every state and territory, with New York and Louisiana the biggest recipients because of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. About a fourth of the money has been used to repair and replace public buildings.In most instances, grants cover at least 75 percent of the cost to return a damaged building to its prior state while also complying with current codes. If the cost of repair is more than half that of replacement, FEMA will pay to build anew. The program also provides grants for hazard mitigation to minimize future damage.When structures in designated flood plains are rebuilt or repaired, FEMA requires that they be elevated to at least the 100-year flood level \u2014 high enough, that is, to withstand a storm with only a 1 percent chance of occurring in a year. Buildings that serve a critical function, like hospitals or power plants, must be raised to the 500-year level.The agency can pay to relocate destroyed buildings if it is deemed cost-effective, but it often isn\u2019t. In New York City, FEMA spent more than $700 million \u2014 with the city pitching in $80 million more \u2014 to repair 72 schools damaged during Sandy. But the city\u2019s high cost of real estate and construction dictated that only one would be moved, to an adjacent site where it will be elevated, according to the Mayor\u2019s Office of Recovery and Resiliency.Instead, the money was spent on measures that accepted the inevitability of future flooding, like raising vents, relocating electrical systems to rooftops and replacing drywall with building materials that could be easily dried and disinfected.But the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, recently found that the separate flood insurance program had paid $5.5 billion from 1978 to 2015 to repair and rebuild more than 30,000 properties that had flooded more than once. Claims for those residences and businesses had been submitted an average of five times.Critics see both FEMA programs as symptomatic of a disjointed and backward-looking approach to disaster planning that devotes inordinate resources to rebuilding at the expense of prevention.\u201cThe fundamental problem is that the entire system is reactive,\u201d said Jeff Hebert, vice president for adaptation and resilience at the Water Institute of the Gulf, a Louisiana-based research group. \u201cIt would be transformational if we took the money that we spend on disasters and instead spent it on the front end on really good adaptation.\u201dAmong Hurricane Katrina\u2019s victims was Lakefront Airport in New Orleans, a general aviation airport built on a jut of land reclaimed from Lake Pontchartrain. Politics drove the selection of the site in the 1930s, but it seemed a good enough idea. The airport would be close to the city center and could accommodate seaplanes, a popular mode of passenger transportation at the time.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.The classic Art Deco terminal, a working monument to the romance of flight, wowed travelers when it opened in 1934. Eight murals of exotic destinations ringed the second floor of a grand atrium, their locations corresponding to the directions on a compass rose inlaid into the terrazzo floor. Three years later, Amelia Earhart slept in the visiting pilots\u2019 quarters on her way to California for her final journey.In 1964, the terminal acquired a Brutalist concrete cladding that made it usable as a Cold War fallout shelter, and its glamour faded. But after Katrina flushed four feet of water through the building, the authority that runs the airport decided to restore its prior glory.It found a willing partner, up to a point, in FEMA, which provided $68.8 million in public assistance grants to repair the airport and its grounds, according to authority officials. That included $20 million for such a lush renovation of the terminal that it is booked regularly for charity galas and debutante balls.And yet, despite FEMA\u2019s substantial investment, the agency has been stymied by its own rules from taking steps to prevent a recurrence in the next big storm.The airport is not much more protected from Pontchartrain\u2019s storm surge than before. Parts are buffered only by a low bulkhead because of fears that a higher one might interfere with takeoffs and landings.In 2015, the airport\u2019s operator, known as the Non-Flood Asset Protection Management Authority, asked FEMA to provide an additional $65 million to build a pump system and movable flood wall that could be put into place before storms. FEMA refused, arguing in part that it would qualify as new construction, which the agency said it could not pay for in certain designated flood zones.The airport authority lost its appeal of that decision in July by the 2-to-1 vote of a federal arbitration board. In dissent, the chief judge, Jonathan Zischkau, wrote that the decision \u201cleaves the entire airport facility \u2014 and a considerable number of people \u2014 at risk and unprotected from future hurricanes and flood disasters.\u201dWilma Heaton, the chairwoman of the authority, said she was determined to continue searching for funds, but considered FEMA\u2019s position nonsensical.\u201cStorm after storm, we know what happens without adequate flood protection,\u201d Ms. Heaton said. \u201cNot addressing it is insanity.\u201dFew places have benefited from FEMA\u2019s largess like Plaquemines Parish, which protrudes southeast from the New Orleans suburbs into the Gulf of Mexico. And few places better embody the costly contradictions of rebuilding on endangered land.Plaquemines was pummeled by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and again by Hurricane Isaac in 2012. Since 2000, FEMA has routed $902.1 million in public assistance grants to the parish for 1,000 separate projects, the Times analysis found, an average of $38,637 for each of the 23,348 current residents. That is barely less than the assessed value of all taxable property.With the exception of the New Orleans bedroom community of Belle Chasse, the parish consists largely of two narrow strips, bordered by levees, on either bank of the Mississippi River. Floodwater breached and topped the 16-foot mounds during Katrina, but they have since been repaired and fortified. Nonetheless, state scientists project that in the case of a 100-year storm, most of the parish outside Belle Chase would be submerged at least 13 feet.A fifth of the Plaquemines population left after Katrina, according to census estimates. But because FEMA will pay to rebuild to prior size and capacity, those changes have not always factored much into recovery planning.FEMA allowed the Plaquemines school board to consolidate and restructure its system after Katrina, including eliminating one of eight schools. But it nonetheless spent nearly $100 million to rebuild three schools on the west bank, and another $36 million to rebuild Phoenix High, the only one on the east bank.Like the jail, the new schools are engineering marvels, red brick fortresses raised more than 20 feet on a forest of columns. But some are clearly larger than needed. Phoenix was designed to accommodate 400 students from prekindergarten through 12th grade, but enrolled only 190 this fall, according to the school board. An average of 13 seniors have graduated each year since it reopened in 2012.School board officials said they had not been willing to bus students long distances to Belle Chasse or across the river by ferry.\u201cWe\u2019re obligated to provide an education for the people who are here,\u201d said Ronald E. White Jr., the chief financial officer. \u201cIt\u2019s not our job to say you can\u2019t live here.\u201d\u201cPlus we wanted to rebuild our communities,\u201d said Denis Rousselle, the superintendent. \u201cPeople would not come back if you didn\u2019t have schools.\u201dFEMA provided enough money to replace damaged contents that the system was able to refurnish even the schools that were not destroyed, Mr. Rousselle said.\u201cThey\u2019ve been so generous with us,\u201d the superintendent said. \u201cI\u2019ve been elated with it.\u201dEven before Katrina made landfall nearby, the Plaquemines jail did not come close to filling its more than 800 beds. The average population was 395 in 2004 and 274 in 2003, according to reports obtained through an open records request. But that did not stop the sheriff at the time, Irvin F. Hingle Jr., known as Jiff, from insisting that the jail be rebuilt at the same capacity on the same site.John Connolly, a senior public assistance adviser in FEMA\u2019s Louisiana Recovery Office, tried to persuade Mr. Hingle to make the jail smaller and move it to higher, more accessible ground. \u201cThey were not receptive to that and largely that was the end of it, sadly,\u201d Mr. Connolly recalled. \u201cWe really did not have the leverage to insist on it.\u201dBecause the jail site sits in a flood zone, FEMA could require that the 207,000-square-foot building be built atop columns, but not that it be moved, explained Thomas M. Womack, the director of the recovery office. \u201cThat\u2019s just what our regulation and policy call for,\u201d he said.Those who knew and worked with him, including his successors and other parish officials, said Mr. Hingle had hoped to revive the devastated economy on the east bank, his political base. Additionally, they said, the sheriff viewed the jail as a profit center that supported his other operations and thus expanded patronage.Essential to his success was his ability to win contracts with federal agencies that paid top rates to house their detainees. Mr. Hingle had a deal with the Department of Homeland Security to hold up to 220 immigration and customs detainees at a daily rate of $47.19 per inmate, records show. That is almost double the paltry $24.39 paid by the state and parish.Things changed after Katrina forced the jail\u2019s evacuation. The federal agency now opts not to house inmates in Plaquemines, or anywhere else south of Lake Pontchartrain, said Bryan D. Cox, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The state corrections system, which uses local jails to relieve crowding, nonetheless remains the Plaquemines jail\u2019s primary supplier. The current sheriff, Gerald A. Turlich Jr., also secured a contract with the United States Marshals Service. While the jail\u2019s average monthly census grew to 548 in the second quarter from fewer than 100 when it opened in 2015, only one in seven are there on local charges.\u201cTwo hundred beds would have been fine, and you would have saved a lot of federal taxpayer dollars,\u201d said Lonnie Greco, who won the sheriff\u2019s job after Mr. Hingle\u2019s indictment (and then lost it to Sheriff Turlich). \u201cAt one time it was a thing to build big prisons to make money, but that time is gone.\u201dThe detention center is not so elevated that it would necessarily stay dry in another Katrina. But it was built of thick precast concrete to withstand a major storm, with backup generators and raised water tanks and circuitry, along with basketball courts, roomy living pods, more than 600 security cameras, biometric entrance scanners and video screens that inmates can use to talk to family members via Skype.\u201cIt seemed an awfully expensive choice,\u201d he said.Sheriff Turlich said that when he took over in 2016, the maintenance and operation of the all-but-empty jail was draining $2 million from the department\u2019s $25 million budget. To help bring it into balance, he raised property tax rates by 8 percent.Agustin Armendariz contributed research.Follow Kevin Sack and John Schwartz on Twitter: @ksacknyt and @jswatz.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Shift on Khashoggi Killing, Trump Edges Closer to Acknowledging a Saudi Role", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said on Thursday that he believes the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is dead, and he expressed confidence in intelligence reports from multiple sources that strongly suggest a high-level Saudi role in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s assassination.Mr. Trump stopped short of saying the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was responsible for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death. But he acknowledged that the allegations that the prince ordered the killing raised hard questions about the American alliance with Saudi Arabia and had ignited one of the most serious foreign policy crises of his presidency.\u201cThis one has caught the imagination of the world, unfortunately,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a brief interview with The New York Times in the Oval Office. \u201cIt\u2019s not a positive. Not a positive.\u201dThe shift in the president\u2019s tone came shortly after a briefing by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and it signaled that after trying to defend the Saudi rulers, Mr. Trump was coming to terms with the far-reaching implications of the Khashoggi case and the likelihood that his closest ally in the Arab world was guilty of the grisly killing of a Saudi-born columnist for The Washington Post.\u201cUnless the miracle of all miracles happens, I would acknowledge that he\u2019s dead,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cThat\u2019s based on everything \u2014 intelligence coming from every side.\u201d Later, before leaving on a trip to Montana, he was asked what the consequences would be if Saudi Arabia\u2019s culpability was established.\u201cWell, it\u2019ll have to be very severe,\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s bad, bad stuff.\u201dIn conversations with allies, the president has begun to distance himself from Prince Mohammed, 33, saying he barely knows him. And he has played down the relationship that Mr. Kushner has cultivated with the Saudi heir.Mr. Trump also signed off on a decision by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to pull out of an investor conference in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, convened by Prince Mohammed \u2014 the highest-level American cancellation from a conference meant to showcase the Saudi kingdom\u2019s progressive future.Mr. Mnuchin announced his withdrawal after an Oval Office meeting that included Mr. Pompeo, who had just returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia and Turkey, where he pressed officials about the fate of Mr. Khashoggi, who vanished after walking into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.Turkish officials said he was brutally killed and his body dismembered by a team of operatives sent from Saudi Arabia. In phone calls with Mr. Trump, Mr. Pompeo and other top American officials, Prince Mohammed and other Saudi leaders have denied any involvement.Mr. Pompeo said on Thursday that the United States would give the Saudis a few more days to conduct their investigation. He told reporters at the White House that the Saudi report would be \u201ctransparent for everyone to see, to ask questions about and to acquire.\u201dMr. Trump said in the interview it was still \u201ca little bit early\u201d in the process to draw definitive conclusions about who ordered the killing. But he expressed no doubt that the truth would come out soon. \u201cWe\u2019re working with the intelligence from numerous countries,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is the best intelligence we could have,\u201d Mr. Trump added.Intelligence reports have drawn direct links between the Saudi operatives who traveled to Istanbul and the Saudi royal court. Four of the operatives, whose images were caught on surveillance video, served as guards for Prince Mohammed in April during his visit to the United States.American intelligences agencies, however, are divided on the degree of responsibility that can be pinned on the prince \u2014 which is complicating an appraisal that they are compiling to present to the White House, according to a former senior administration official.The Central Intelligence Agency, whose analysts draw on an array of hard facts and subjective judgments, are increasingly convinced that Prince Mohammed is culpable in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death.But other agencies have stopped short of that conclusion. The National Security Agency, for example, collected communications intercepts of Saudi officials discussing a plan to lure Mr. Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia from his home in Virginia and then detain him, according to a former senior American official. But the intercepts do not reveal whether Prince Mohammed directly ordered the killing of Mr. Khashoggi.During his conversation with The Times, Mr. Trump was uncharacteristically guarded. He declined repeated requests to discuss the chain of events that led to Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance or the crown prince\u2019s role.In part, Mr. Trump acknowledged, that caution reflected his recognition that the Khashoggi case now posed a bigger challenge to him than other issues \u201cbecause it\u2019s taken on a bigger life than it would normally take on.\u201dStill, Mr. Trump emphasized the value of the alliance with Saudi Arabia to American military contractors and other firms. \u201cThey\u2019ve been a very good ally, and they\u2019ve bought massive amounts of various things and investments in this country, which I appreciate,\u201d he said.Those business ties have been sorely tested by the furor over Mr. Khashoggi. Before Mr. Mnuchin withdrew from the conference, known as the Future Investment Initiative, a stream of Wall Street and high-tech executives had canceled, citing the uncertainties over Mr. Khashoggi.Mr. Mnuchin was planning to speak at the conference during a six-country, weeklong swing through the Middle East, focused on combating terrorism financing. Several prominent chief executives canceled plans to attend, along with ministers from Britain, France and the Netherlands.The Treasury secretary, who had been fielding calls from executives in recent days about the wisdom of going, had urged people to focus on the facts and evidence. However, the pressure to cancel \u2014 which included calls from Republican lawmakers \u2014 became too much.With so many executives and foreign officials scrapping plans to go to Riyadh, Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s attendance emerged as a litmus test for the United States\u2019 commitment to human rights. After Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s decision, Goldman Sachs announced that Dina H. Powell, a senior executive who was previously a deputy national security adviser in the White House, would also not attend.While Mr. Trump\u2019s views appeared to be hardening, Mr. Kushner was still lobbying his father-in-law to stand by Prince Mohammed, arguing the scandal would eventually pass, according to two people who have had recent discussions with White House officials.Even Mr. Pompeo reminded reporters of the United States\u2019 long \u201cstrategic\u201d relationship with the Saudis, dating back to 1932, and said the kingdom remained an \u201cimportant counterterrorism partner.\u201dAmerican intelligence officials have not yet had access to the audiotapes that Turkish officials say they have of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s interrogation, torture and death. That means they must rely on other information they have and what the Turks are telling them \u2014 which American officials say is credible.The director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, will have to reconcile the differences between the C.I.A. and National Security Agency assessments. Mr. Coats has privately expressed concerns about presenting an appraisal that boxes in Mr. Trump or poses a challenge to the president\u2019s intention to maintain a close relationship with the kingdom.Nor does Mr. Coats want to give Mr. Trump an assessment noting dissenting views from intelligence agencies, as would be standard in any appraisal, especially one with such political explosiveness.Even so, the former administration official said, an intelligence assessment that reflects the spy services\u2019 best overall judgment but has no smoking gun linking Prince Mohammed to the killing could be one the White House could \u201cchoose to dismiss,\u201d based on the lack of incriminating evidence \u2014 something he referred to as the \u201cKavanaugh defense.\u201dThe Saudis will need to wrap up their investigation in the next few days, the former official said. The longer the delay, he added, the more likely Turkish officials will release more damning information, making it even more difficult for Saudi officials to present an explanation that will weather international scrutiny.Alan Rappeport and Julian E. Barnes contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With $30 Million, Obscure Democratic Group Floods the Zone in House Races", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRADENTON BEACH, Fla. \u2014 The billboard flickered from the side of a truck, displaying an image of Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida, wearing a yachtsman\u2019s cap. Keith Fitzgerald, a local dignitary invited by the group Floridians for a Fair Shake, stood before it as he tore into the lawmaker\u2019s record.Floridians for a Fair Shake has criticized Mr. Buchanan for months, with paid advertising, campaign workers, and events like this, on a recent Sunday in a beachside parking lot. Yet Mr. Fitzgerald, a former Democratic state legislator and something of the guest of honor, confessed, \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know a whole lot about this group.\u201d\u201cThey told me what they were doing,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where the money comes from.\u201dA structure unknown even to some of those involved, Floridians for a Fair Shake and 13 other groups around the country are funded and coordinated out of a single office in Washington, with the goal of battering Republicans for their health care and economic policies during the midterm elections.At the center of the effort is an opaquely named Democratic organization, the Hub Project, which is on track to spend nearly $30 million since 2017 pressuring members of Congress in their districts. The great bulk of its funding has come from so-called dark money \u2014 funds from donors who are not legally required to reveal their names.With that money, the Hub Project \u2014 in an initiative run by a former Obama administration official and public relations specialist, Leslie Dach, and Arkadi Gerney, a former political strategist for the liberal Center for American Progress \u2014 set up an array of affiliate groups around the country, many with vaguely sympathetic names like Keep Iowa Healthy, New Jersey for a Better Future and North Carolinians for a Fair Economy. The Hub Project then used them to mobilize volunteers and run advertising on policy issues against Republican members of Congress many months before the election.While some of its visible activities during the midterms have been previously reported, the Hub Project has never before disclosed the scale of its efforts or discussed them extensively on the record.Mr. Gerney, the group\u2019s executive director, said in an interview that the initiative targeting several dozen congressional districts had been designed to keep the focus on the Republicans\u2019 legislative agenda in an election heavily dominated by President Trump\u2019s personality. He described it as a test case for a larger theory of Democratic politics, defined by continuous attacks on Republican policies rather than on Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s a very chaotic media environment and, understandably, lots of people are chasing Trump\u2019s Twitter feed,\u201d Mr. Gerney said. \u201cBut for most people, their health care, their family finances, their economic future \u2014 these things really matter.\u201dMr. Gerney displayed no ambivalence about using undisclosed contributions \u2014 traditionally a source of dismay for Democrats \u2014 to punish Republicans for last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax law and their attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in unilateral disarmament,\u201d Mr. Gerney said.Mr. Gerney and others involved in the effort described it unfolding in stages, first targeting five congressional districts in the summer of 2017, then expanding to a map of 19 seats over the next 11 months. In some districts, the Hub Project\u2019s state affiliates were running paid advertising months before other outside groups got involved \u2014 and before members of Congress mobilized to defend themselves.A former senior official with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Jessica Floyd, has overseen the advertising.Polling conducted for the Hub Project, and scrutinized by a pair of Stanford University researchers in an analysis shared with The New York Times, found that voters in districts where its affiliates operated were likelier to remember their representative\u2019s votes on health care and taxes, though in some cases ad campaigns also appeared to generate backlashes among Republicans.In North Carolina\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, the affiliate group North Carolinians for a Fair Economy spent about $736,000 criticizing Mr. Holding, a third-term lawmaker in a conservative-leaning district, and pressuring the Republican in television ads to \u201cstop raising the cost of health care.\u201d Carter Wrenn, a political adviser for Mr. Holding, said the attack had come as something of an ambush and forced Mr. Holding to scramble to air an ad defending his record.\u201cThey made the first big attack on George,\u201d said Mr. Wrenn, adding that he had sought unsuccessfully to discern who was behind the attack: \u201cWe tried to figure out who they were, but there\u2019s not much you can tell about who funds them and who they are, exactly.\u201dMr. Holding is battling for re-election against his Democratic challenger, Linda Coleman.Mr. Gerney confirmed that the Hub Project controls the money flowing from the Sixteen Thirty Fund into the state-level groups, but the larger nonprofit does not have to disclose its funding sources.Mr. Gerney also confirmed that the Hub Project controls a super PAC of its own, Change Now, which has been funding advertising this fall against a smaller list of Republican-held districts that includes some of the same targets. The group has filed a report with the Federal Election Commission showing it received $1.75 million in funding from the League of Conservation Voters, the influential environmental group, and several people involved with the effort said future reports were expected to show contributions from national labor unions.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.\u201cThey really dislike dark money and any type of political spending,\u201d Ms. Muller said of voters. At the same time, she noted, research suggests \u201cvoters trust outside-group ads more than they trust candidate ads.\u201dMr. Dach said that the network of state groups had bolstered the Hub Project\u2019s credibility with voters, connecting it with local activists who in some cases ended up starring in ads. Mr. Dach, a former Obama administration health care official, said the 14-month advocacy campaign had helped keep policy at the forefront of the midterm election.Mr. Dach and Mr. Gerney both said they decided to go on the record with the details of the campaign because they hoped Democrats would adopt it for future election cycles. In the past, Mr. Dach said, Democrats had lacked the funds and focus to sustain an argument on core issues like health care.\u201cThese issues are clear, they\u2019re understandable to people, but I think we neglected and we were financially unable to sustain this kind of work before,\u201d Mr. Dach said. \u201cWe have been on the same message \u2014 pre-existing conditions, age tax, health care costs, sabotage \u2014 from day one.\u201dThe event in Bradenton Beach taunting Mr. Buchanan was emblematic of the group\u2019s approach \u2014 and its limitations. Democrats had been hopeful of flipping the conservative-leaning district, anchored in the comfortable and predominantly white suburbs on the south end of Tampa Bay. A prominent local trial lawyer, David Shapiro, jumped in as the Democratic candidate and the race intensified after a Hub Project researcher discovered Mr. Buchanan\u2019s yacht purchase.Yet as voters on the right have grown more energized about the midterm elections, Mr. Buchanan has appeared somewhat more secure in his re-election prospects. As Mr. Fitzgerald assailed the Republican\u2019s voting record, flanked by an activist dressed as a yacht captain, Vince Cavell looked on skeptically from a short distance.Mr. Cavell, 66, who retired to the area after a career in the computer business, shrugged at the attacks on Mr. Buchanan\u2019s support for the tax law.\u201cI\u2019m enjoying the lower taxes,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cuomo to Debate Republican Foe After Week of Barbs and Chicken Insults", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his Republican opponent, Marcus J. Molinaro, have agreed to a televised debate on Tuesday, after more than a week of wrangling, dodging and barbs over who was more afraid to face the other.The debate would be Mr. Cuomo\u2019s first one-on-one face-off with his general election opponent for governor; in previous years, he has participated in debates with his Republican challenger as well as other minor-party candidates.Mr. Molinaro rejected that proposal, calling for more notice for voters and a televised meeting. A weekend of continued rhetorical missiles ensued, with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s team now being the one to accuse Mr. Molinaro of hiding from a debate.Finally, on Sunday, Mr. Cuomo offered a televised debate for Tuesday. Mr. Molinaro accepted on Monday.\u201cThe voters of New York won an important victory last night,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said during a news conference.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s team called the acceptance overdue. \u201cAfter days of ducking the debate, we\u2019re glad Marc Molinaro has finally agreed,\u201d Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for the Cuomo campaign, said on Monday. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201dAs with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s debate against his primary election opponent, Cynthia Nixon, there will be no opening or closing statements; both candidates will be seated; Marcia Kramer, from WCBS, will be one of the moderators; and the debate will be taped beforehand, to be broadcast later in the day.But Mr. Molinaro brushed off questions about whether he would be at a disadvantage during the debate, or how he would prepare for a one-on-one encounter that had come together on such short notice.\u201cI\u2019ll be spending some time with my kids,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said, adding that he had been preparing for the debate \u201csince the day\u201d he announced his campaign.Mr. Cuomo spent the day before the debate in New York City and on Long Island, attending the Nassau County Democratic Committee\u2019s fall dinner; his aides declined to say how he would prepare for the debate. Mr. Molinaro held a news conference on developmental disabilities and met with city voters.The debate will likely be Mr. Molinaro\u2019s biggest platform yet to attack the governor on public corruption, the upstate economy and the breakdown of the city\u2019s subway system, three topics Mr. Molinaro has made central to his campaign. (Mr. Molinaro on Monday also called for two more debates upstate, a challenge Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign has not addressed.)Mr. Molinaro also plans to play up his underdog story, emphasizing his personal biography \u2014 he has repeatedly said he grew up in a family that relied on food stamps \u2014 and contrast it with the governor\u2019s, in an attempt to cast Mr. Cuomo as the scion of a political dynasty, according to a person with knowledge of Mr. Molinaro\u2019s plans.\u201cThis is a big opportunity for me to present myself,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said on Monday.Still, barring a major slip-up from Mr. Cuomo, it seems unlikely that one hour on television, right before Game 1 of the World Series, would turn the tide for Mr. Molinaro. But it is precisely the possibility of those slip-ups in an unscripted, unpredictable debate that has made Mr. Cuomo \u2014 a micromanager by temperament \u2014 almost congenitally wary of such matchups, according to a person familiar with the governor\u2019s thinking.Mr. Molinaro seemed to acknowledge that had stood to gain far more from the debate than Mr. Cuomo did. \u201cWe have what we asked for,\u201d he said.The governor, for his part, has often invoked the urgency of the \u201cblue wave\u201d nationwide, and he may use the debate to tar Mr. Molinaro as a \u201cmini-me\u201d of President Trump who has been weak on women\u2019s rights, gun safety and white supremacists. That message is hardly new to the airwaves, though: Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign has spent more than $1.75 million on television ads since the primary election in September, according to campaign finance filings. Mr. Molinaro\u2019s has spent $100,000.At the same time, Mr. Cuomo has also tried to broadcast a wider message, perhaps to an audience beyond New York, that the backlash to Mr. Trump would be seen in a \u201cred, white and blue wave,\u201d and that the administration\u2019s policies were not merely anti-New York, but \u201canti-American.\u201dThe debate is set to air on tape delay at 7 p.m. on television and radio by WCBS, and shared with local affiliates around the state. The moderators will be Ms. Kramer, a longtime TV reporter for the station, and Rich Lamb from the station\u2019s radio affiliate.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tesla Reports a Rare Quarterly Profit, Its Biggest Ever", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTesla on Wednesday reported its first quarterly profit in two years and its biggest ever. But for the electric-car maker and its unpredictable chief, the question is whether it can keep making money.The company\u2019s third-quarter earnings were helped by cost-cutting, spending less on future models, delaying payments to suppliers and, most important, rushing to sell as many cars as possible. It may not be able to do all those things quarter after quarter.The company declared it a \u201chistoric quarter\u201d and its chief executive, Elon Musk, promised that future would be brighter still, telling analysts on a conference call he expected Tesla to be profitable in the fourth quarter and in \u201call quarters going forward.\u201d He was saying in effect that his company was no longer in start-up mode.Tesla reported a $312 million profit for the three months that ended Sept. 30, thanks to a surge in production and sales of its Model 3 sedan. The company has long promised that the model would help make electric vehicles and Tesla itself a mass-market phenomenon.On Wednesday, he was even-tempered on a conference call with analysts. He declined to answer a question about the makeup of the company\u2019s board, saying he would discuss only operational issues. (In the agreement with the S.E.C., Tesla agreed to appoint two new independent directors to its board.)In the 15 years since Mr. Musk and his partners founded Tesla, the company has never reported an annual profit. In previous quarters, the company\u2019s costs increased as it made more cars. To finance its operations, Tesla, which also makes solar panels and batteries, has had to sell stock, take out loans and ask customers to make $1,000 refundable deposits for cars and energy products that they might not get for many months.The profit the company reported in the third quarter will help stabilize Tesla\u2019s finances and end a streak of quarters in which the automaker used close to $1 billion in cash. In the second quarter, the company reported a $718 million loss.Tesla ended September with $3 billion in cash compared with $2.2 billion at the end of the previous quarter. The company generated $881 million in free cash flow \u2014 cash produced through operations less capital expenditures. \u201cThe cash-flow number is impressive,\u201d said David Whiston, an auto analyst at Morningstar. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of cash for a company their size.\u201dBut the company could face difficulties ahead. The increase in sales of the Model 3 could cause demand to soften in the fourth quarter.The company, which until recently only sold tens of thousands of luxury cars a year, will need to find many more buyers for the Model 3, which sells for $46,000 to $64,000 before federal and state tax incentives. Mr. Musk said that the company expected sales to remain strong as it starts shipping the car to Europe in the first three months of next year and Asia after that.\u201cAs long as they keep producing more cars than the previous quarter, there\u2019s a good chance they can keep profits going,\u201d Mr. Whiston said.In a sign that buyers are still interested in the car after months of waiting for it, Tesla said that of the 455,000 Model 3 reservations it reported having in August 2017, fewer than 20 percent had been canceled.Tesla next year is supposed to start making a more affordable version of the Model 3 priced at $35,000, and Mr. Musk has said that Tesla would lose money on that model if the company produced it now. The cheaper Model 3 is important because the $7,500 federal tax credit available to buyers of Tesla cars will be cut by half on Jan. 1 and phased out entirely over the course of 2019, making the company\u2019s cars more expensive.Tesla recently began offering a Model 3 priced at $46,000 as an interim step before it can produce the $35,000 version. \u201cWe don\u2019t really have the ability to get to $35,000 right away,\u201d Mr. Musk said, but he said Tesla was \u201cprobably less than six months from that.\u201dEven though Tesla is finally hitting its stride in production, \u201cthe company isn\u2019t out of the woods yet,\u201d said Jeremy Acevedo, manager of industry analysis at Edmunds, a market researcher. \u201cThe $35,000 Model 3 remains a fantasy, and with the full tax credit for that car now off the table, it will be interesting to see how many buyers are willing to keep waiting for it to be a reality.\u201dThe company is still struggling to deliver cars to customers, which Mr. Musk has described as \u201cdelivery logistics hell.\u201d The quality of the Model 3 has also come under question as many customers have complained about receiving cars with scratched paint, cracked windows and other defects.If sales falter, the company could quickly find itself in a financial squeeze. It has to make bond payments of $230 million in November and $920 million in March. It can use stock for the second payment but only if its share price is above $360. At the same time, Tesla hopes to build a factory in China, which will require hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenses.As of Sept. 30, Tesla owed its suppliers $3.6 billion, up from $3 billion at the end of the second quarter. The company\u2019s debt totaled more than $10 billion.Tesla shares closed at $288.50 on Wednesday before its earnings were released, down more than 20 percent from early August. The stock was up 10 percent in aftermarket trading.An earlier version of this article misstated Tesla\u2019s cash at the end of the second quarter. It was $2.2 billion, not $2.4 billion.Advertisement"}

Johnson considered asking Mr. Gallagher to be his running mate before settling on Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota.Mr. Gallagher was both self-made and a creation of the party machine.When he was 10, he helped support the family after his father died. He later enlisted in the Army and then worked his way through law school at nights in a boatyard.He was a progeny of the notorious Hudson County Democratic organization and its legacy of corruption \u2014 but one of its \u201cfinest products,\u201d as the nonpartisan Almanac of American Politics put it at the time.Mr. Gallagher in 1972. A Democrat, he served in Congress for seven terms before he was jettisoned by his own party.Still, while he was well liked in Washington and immensely popular in his hometown, Bayonne, he, like so many other New Jersey politicians, wound up serving his last term in prison.In 1968, Life magazine reported on wiretapped conversations suggesting that Mr. Gallagher had not only helped protect the Mafia boss Joseph Zicarelli\u2019s gambling operations from police interference, but that he had also enlisted Mr. Zicarelli to get rid of the body of a loan shark who had died in Mr. Gallagher\u2019s home.But in April 1972, Mr. Gallagher was indicted on charges of committing perjury, attempting to evade $102,000 in income taxes and conspiring with former Jersey City Mayor Thomas J. Whelan and others to hide kickbacks. After initially pleading not guilty, he admitted to tax evasion that December and served 17 months in prison. Thousands of constituents welcomed him home when he was released.Cornelius Edward Gallagher, who was known as Neil, was born on March 2, 1921, in Bayonne to Cornelius and Ann (Murphy) Gallagher. He was 8 when his father, a detective, died. By 10 he was helping to supplement an $83-a-month police pension by working as a shoeshine boy and a soda jerk.After graduating from Bayonne High School, he enrolled in Seton Hall College (now Seton Hall University) in New Jersey. But he interrupted his studies two months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 to enlist in the Army. He served in the infantry in Europe in World War II and rejoined the Army to serve in the Korean War. He was discharged as a captain with two Bronze Stars and three Purple Hearts.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018Mr. Gallagher finished college in 1946 and graduated from John Marshall Law School in Newark (now part of Seton Hall).He was elected to the Hudson County Board of Freeholders in 1953. The party organization supported him for Congress in 1958 against a Democratic incumbent, Alfred D. Sieminski, whom party leaders feared would be vulnerable that November.But in 1972, with Mr. Gallagher under indictment and the district redrawn, Democratic leaders decided instead to endorse a neighboring incumbent, Representative Dominick Daniels. Mr. Daniels won the primary; Mr. Gallagher ran third with 15 percent.He was later a vice president of Baron/Canning International, a public relations firm in New York City.A 1978 House Ethics Committee report concluded that in 1971 and 1972, Mr. Gallagher had intervened on behalf of Tongsun Park, a South Korean businessman whom the congressman had helped restore as a middleman for Korean purchases of American rice. Mr. Park gave Mr. Gallagher $74,000 in cash, according to the report, which found no violations of ethical or campaign financing rules.He married Claire Richter, who died in 2004. He is survived by their daughters, Christine Forge, Patrice Maillet and Bridget Davis; 11 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Diane Brennan, died in 2013.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Republicans Rushing to Save House Seats From Onslaught of Democratic Money", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCINCINNATI \u2014 As the 2018 midterm campaign enters its final full week, House Republicans are rushing to fortify their defenses in conservative-leaning districts they thought were secure, pouring millions of dollars into a last-minute bid to build a new firewall against Democrats.Republicans, in defending a 23-seat majority, are likely to lose a handful of open or Democratic-tilting seats as well as another dozen suburban districts that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016, according to political strategists in both parties. But now Republican officials are increasingly concerned about Democratic incursions in some of the remaining 30 competitive districts on the House map where the Republican candidates thought they had an edge.For the final two weeks of the election, Democratic campaigns and outside groups are on track to substantially outspend Republicans, strategists on both sides say. Democrats are set to spend $143 million on television advertising in House races, compared with $86 million for Republicans, according to one analysis by a Democratic strategist tracking media buys.Democratic super PACs and other outside groups are poised to outspend their Republican counterparts by a wide margin, erasing an advantage Republicans planned on having.Much of the Democrats\u2019 unanticipated firepower comes from one source: Michael R. Bloomberg, the liberal former New York City mayor who may run for president, plans to spend about $20 million on House advertising through his super PAC, Independence USA, in the final week of the campaign, a Bloomberg adviser said.With Democratic challengers out-raising their opponents in more than 100 districts last quarter and President Trump energizing the left as well as his own base, well-financed House Republican groups are scrambling to put down emerging threats in states like Florida and Washington while augmenting existing spending in Kansas, Virginia and Minnesota.[Read about the political motivations of people who recently made their first donations to an election campaign.]The midterm campaign has returned to the sort of bipolar dynamic that defined it at the start of the year. Senate Republicans are confident once again in retaining their one-seat majority in that chamber thanks to a favorable map of races. But Democrats are poised to pick up an array of governorships in major states and could dislodge Republicans\u2019 eight-year hold on the House.Republicans hope they can keep the House if they sweep the closest races, a tall order given the Democratic enthusiasm in many districts.But much of the Republican spending is aimed less at securing a majority than at limiting the breadth of a Democratic takeover as the field of competition grows well beyond 40 seats.\u201cIt\u2019s the suburban seats and it\u2019s the flow of money,\u201d Representative Tom Cole, a longtime Oklahoma Republican and former House campaign chairman, said of the party\u2019s two overriding concerns.Many Democrats remain deeply scarred by Mr. Trump\u2019s victory, memories that have been unnervingly revived by the recent spike in conservative enthusiasm. But unlike at this moment in the presidential election, when Mrs. Clinton sought to harden her party\u2019s putative blue wall, it is Republicans who are on the defensive in the battle for the House, with the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership \u2014 the two main groups financing Republican advertising \u2014 routing money anew into campaigns.\u201cSome of the guys who should be in trouble are doing O.K.,\u201d said Michael Steel, a longtime House Republican strategist, alluding to lawmakers in districts Mr. Trump lost or only narrowly carried. \u201cBut there appear to be little fires everywhere.\u201dThe biggest danger for Republicans in House races remains in the moderate suburbs of blue states like New York, New Jersey and California, where they could lose up to a dozen seats \u2014 half their margin of control. Then there are a handful of other affluent districts just outside other cities where voters have recoiled from Mr. Trump\u2019s divisive style of politics.\u201cI think we\u2019ll have a suburban wave,\u201d said Liesl Hickey, a former executive director of the N.R.C.C. \u201cA lot of the districts that we are most likely to lose are Democratic-leaning, they\u2019re just going to what their modern DNA is.\u201dBut what poses so much peril for Republicans is that a surge of donations to all manner of Democratic candidates has allowed them to go on offense in districts that had received far less attention and money. Those races in more conservative, exurban areas could make the difference between Democrats winning a splinter-thin majority or claiming a firm grasp on the House.Mr. Trump\u2019s standing in these districts is not as dismal as it is in those races Republicans are likely to lose. But two years after he carried the districts, his conduct in office has pushed his disapproval ratings to about the same level of his approval ratings. And with Democrats enjoying an advantage on intensity and money, and Republicans in many of these races unprepared for the scale of both, Republicans are vulnerable.It is a similar story in North Carolina, where Mr. Trump touched down on Friday to help a couple of Republican candidates running in conservative districts near Charlotte who have been out-raised by Democrats and have had to rely out on outside groups.\u201cThis is a tough environment for Republicans and when you get outspent two to one or three to one over the last few weeks you\u2019re asking for trouble,\u201d said Corry Bliss, who runs the House Republican super PAC and has been forced to fill that gap between Republicans and better-funded rivals.In a particularly frustrating development for Republican leaders, they are racing to protect two House seats they had already spent tens of millions of dollars defending in special elections: one anchored in suburban Atlanta\u2019s Cobb County and the other in central Ohio. In the Georgia seat, Republicans say a combination of robust Democratic turnout \u2014 propelled by Stacey Abrams\u2019s campaign for governor \u2014 and a heavy financial investment by Mr. Bloomberg has put them unexpectedly on defense.Tilting the political map further, Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s group is also financing ads in two other conservative-leaning suburban districts long viewed as relatively safe by Republicans: one held by Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler of Washington, the other a seat in the suburbs of Jacksonville, Fla., that former Representative Ron DeSantis vacated to run for governor.Republicans are straining to keep up. Just in the last few days, Republican committees have spent millions on Ms. Herrera Beutler and Mr. Mast of Florida \u2014 both of whom hold center-right, outer-suburban districts \u2014 as well as for a couple of conservative open seats in Virginia and Florida. At the same time, they have added additional funding into a Virginia Beach-based district and seats in southern Minnesota, in suburban Des Moines and around Topeka, Kan.\u201cWe\u2019re now seeing opportunities that we didn\u2019t think would be there,\u201d said Representative Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, adding: \u201cI do feel confident that we\u2019re going to get the majority and then some.\u201dFormer Representative Lynn Westmoreland of Georgia, a Republican who served as vice chairman of the party\u2019s campaign committee, said Republicans faced races that were \u201ctightening up\u201d across the board, especially in diverse suburbs and districts full of right-of-center \u201csoccer moms.\u201d He said Republicans stood a chance to hold the House if some of those moderate women returned to the fold.The difference between a narrowly held Democratic House, or even one with the barest of Republican majorities, will most likely turn on about 20 districts that Mr. Trump won comfortably but not overwhelmingly and that contain a mix of new developments as well as smaller, older communities. Many of these seats were gerrymandered by Republican state legislators to protect incumbents, but that was in the pre-Trump era, when Republicans could more reliably count on the votes of moderate women.\u201cThey have an assumption about that voter and their fidelity to the Republican Party that is not true under Donald Trump,\u201d said Rahm Emanuel, the Chicago mayor and former House Democratic campaign chief, of voters he called \u201canti-Hillary but never pro-Trump.\u201dRepublicans in some once-safe districts expressed confidence they would hang on. In the Cincinnati area, Representative Steve Chabot is counting on the addition of a heavily Republican exurban county that was added to his district to ward off a well-funded challenge from Aftab Pureval, the 36-year-old Hamilton County clerk who raised over twice what Mr. Chabot did in the last quarter.\u201cOne of the things he has been successful at is raising a boatload of money,\u201d Mr. Chabot acknowledged. He lost his seat once before when Barack Obama was at the top of the 2008 ticket and had to win it back two years later, but he said he felt assured of his success this time. Mr. Chabot said that his race was \u201cnot really\u201d competitive and that he might win by over six points.On his way to pick up a few dozen Xavier University students to caravan with them to an early voting site, Mr. Pureval said that he had his \u201ceyes wide open\u201d about the difficulty of the district and that he was counting on a wave of energy to overcome the Republican gerrymander.One danger for Republicans may be lawmakers who have never faced true political combat.Some in the party fear Representative Rob Woodall of Georgia may have waited too long to take his race seriously. Mr. Woodall, who holds a rapidly diversifying suburban district, has yet to run a single television ad, and Democratic polling in the governor\u2019s race has shown Ms. Abrams with a solid lead in the area.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Carolyn Bourdeaux, the Democrat challenging Mr. Woodall, said she was mystified by his approach to the campaign. Ms. Bourdeaux has raised far more money than Mr. Woodall and finished September with about $273,000 more in the bank than he had. Unchallenged on television, she has positioned herself as a nonthreatening moderate in a changing district and has declined to endorse left-wing priorities like single-payer health care.\u201cHe has not put together a particularly aggressive campaign at all,\u201d Ms. Bourdeaux said of Mr. Woodall.Patricia Mazzei contributed reporting from Palm Beach, Fla.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A World Series Matchup That\u2019s a Long Time Coming", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Dodgers and the Red Sox share big payrolls, rich histories and many players who have worn both uniforms. But they last faced each other for the championship more than a century ago.BOSTON \u2014 There will be no underdogs in the 114th World Series, which opens at Fenway Park on Tuesday. The Los Angeles Dodgers have gone three decades without a title but have spent about $1.4 billion in salaries to claim the last six National League West crowns. The Boston Red Sox, who will try to win their fourth championship in the last 15 seasons, outspent every other team this season, with a payroll of roughly $230 million.At roughly $200 million, the Dodgers ranked third in payroll, trailing Boston and the San Francisco Giants, an also-ran team that proved money isn\u2019t everything. It helps, of course, but for all of their spending, the Dodgers and the Red Sox have gone more than a century since their last World Series matchup.That was in 1916, when the Red Sox beat the Brooklyn Robins in five games. A young Red Sox left-hander named Babe Ruth \u2014 then with just seven career home runs \u2014 went 14 innings to win Game 2 at Braves Field. The Red Sox played there to sell more tickets than they could have at Fenway, less than two miles away.The teams rarely face each other in the regular season, either. They played three games at Dodger Stadium in 2016 but have not met in Boston in eight years. Clayton Kershaw, the Dodgers\u2019 three-time Cy Young Award winner, has never thrown a pitch in the shadow of the Green Monster.\u201cI\u2019m so ecstatic to play at Fenway,\u201d said the Dodgers\u2019 Chris Taylor, whose tumbling catch on the left-field warning track at Miller Park preserved the lead in Game 7. \u201cI love that place. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be bumping. Their fans are going to be loud, they\u2019re going to be into it. Boston/L.A. World Series \u2014 it doesn\u2019t get any better than that.\u201d\u201cFor us to win these three games and even the two in New York, I feel like it says a lot about us and our coaching staff,\u201d Boston starter Nathan Eovaldi said after the clincher in Houston. \u201cA.C. does a great job of preparing us for these games and for the moment, and everybody doesn\u2019t try to do too much.\u201dCora \u2014 A.C. to his players \u2014 won the A.L.C.S. despite getting only four innings from his ace starter, Chris Sale, because of a stomach illness. He will start Game 1. \u201cThere\u2019s no holding back now,\u201d said Sale, who missed much of the second half with shoulder trouble. \u201cMy job\u2019s been the same since the first day I got here: You hand me the ball when you want me to throw it, and take it out of my hand when you want me to stop.\u201dKershaw has pitched in all but four current ballparks (the others are in Minnesota, Tampa Bay and Texas) and came to Fenway on Sunday to throw off the bullpen mound. The nearby left-field wall does not faze him.\u201cUsually when I give up homers, they\u2019re not cheap anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it probably won\u2019t matter if there\u2019s a fence there or not that\u2019s really close.\u201dMore important will be the deep lineup Cora could deploy, with platoon possibilities at first base (Steve Pearce or Mitch Moreland), second base (Ian Kinsler or Brock Holt) and third base (Eduardo Nunez or Rafael Devers). Andrew Benintendi, Jackie Bradley Jr. and Mookie Betts play high-impact outfield defense, and a relentless lineup blends power, contact and speed.The Dodgers strike out a lot more and run a lot less, but only one team, the Yankees, hit more home runs this season. A two-run homer by Cody Bellinger and a three-run blast by Yasiel Puig gave the Dodgers all their runs in Game 7 against the Brewers, and Manager Dave Roberts aggressively seeks matchup advantages.Besides shortstop Manny Machado and third baseman Justin Turner, every Dodgers position player has a hitter from the opposite side who is roughly interchangeable. Roberts used four starting second basemen (Brian Dozier, Enrique Hernandez, Max Muncy and Taylor) in the last five N.L.C.S. games.\u201cAnytime you have a guy that can play multiple positions and do it well, I think it has kind of a multiplying effect on your roster,\u201d said Andrew Friedman, the Dodgers\u2019 president for baseball operations. \u201cIt extends your roster beyond 25.\u201dOnly two of the 25 Dodgers on the N.L.C.S. roster have won a championship ring: first baseman David Freese with the 2011 Cardinals and reliever Ryan Madson with the 2008 Phillies and the 2015 Royals. The Red Sox, likewise, have just two players with rings: shortstop Xander Bogaerts and reliever Brandon Workman, the last holdovers from their 2013 World Series roster.In that way, nearly everyone on the field will be hoping to achieve something new and priceless. For all of the Boston bling and Dodgers dollars, this World Series will play out before passionate fans, on opposite coasts, by franchises steeped in history in two of the majors\u2019 three oldest ballparks (sorry, Wrigley Field).As Kasten said, sincerely this time, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be as pure of a baseball experience as you can have in the modern era.\u201dBoth managers also played for both of teams, another first for the World Series. The Dodgers drafted Alex Cora in the third round in 1996, and he spent his first seven major league seasons there. After a brief stop in Cleveland, Cora joined the Red Sox and earned a World Series ring as a backup infielder in 2007. Dave Roberts, a former outfielder, spent two and a half seasons as Cora\u2019s teammate with the Dodgers before a roster shake-up sent him to the Red Sox in a trade on July 31, 2004.\u201cHe was crushed,\u201d Cora said, adding that he encouraged Roberts to see the positive side. \u201cI told him, \u2018Hey, man, you\u2019re going to a great city. They have a chance to do something special.\u2019\u201d\u201cI've got a lot of great memories, even flying into Logan,\u201d Roberts said Monday. \u201cJust this time of year, this city, the leaves changing \u2014 it all comes back to 2004, my teammates and coaches, and that energy only Fenway Park has.\u201dSeven of the eight postseason clinchers this month have come on the road; the Yankees\u2019 wild-card victory over Oakland is the exception. The Astros also clinched the championship in Los Angeles last fall, and if the Red Sox do it there in Game 4 or 5 this weekend, the Dodgers would become the first team since the 1936-37 New York Giants to lose the World Series on their home field in consecutive seasons. Then again, if the Dodgers can knock out the Red Sox in four or five games, they would celebrate at their home park for the first time since 1963. The Dodgers\u2019 last three titles have come on the road: in Minnesota (1965), New York (1981) and Oakland (1988). Once upon a time, Craig Kimbrel and Justin Turner were simply ginger-haired baseball players with little to no facial hair. But Kimbrel, the Red Sox closer, and Turner, the Dodgers\u2019 third baseman, now seem to be competing for the unofficial title of bushiest, scraggliest, most unkempt beard in sports. Turner trimmed his for his wedding in Mexico last off-season (Orel Hershiser, the most valuable player of the 1988 World Series, officiated the ceremony), but it\u2019s safe to say he hasn\u2019t touched a razor in a while. As for Kimbrel, he sees no reason for a trim. \u201cMy daughter loves it,\u201d Kimbrel said at the All-Star Game. \u201cMy teammates like it. We\u2019ll see how long it goes.\u201d It has kept going, and growing, right through to the World Series.The Red Sox have plenty of experience in shifting their designated hitter to the field for World Series road games. David Ortiz played first base in all seven of Boston\u2019s road games in the 2004, 2007 and 2013 World Series, handling 45 chances without an error while the Red Sox lost just once. J.D. Martinez made 57 starts in the outfield for Boston this season and will play there in games at Dodger Stadium, with Mookie Betts possibly shifting to second base, his usual position in the minors. Martinez has fond memories of Dodger Stadium, where he hit four home runs for Arizona on Sept. 4, 2017. No player has ever hit four homers in a postseason game.David Price\u2019s first invitation to professional baseball came from the Dodgers, who drafted him in the 19th round in 2004 out of high school in Murfreesboro, Tenn. Price went to Vanderbilt instead and became the first overall pick by Tampa Bay in 2007. The Dodgers looked to Tennessee again in the first round in 2015, choosing Vanderbilt pitcher Walker Buehler, who starred as a rookie this season and made a strong start in the N.L.C.S. clincher, as Price did in closing out the A.L.C.S. But don\u2019t expect much banter between Price and Buehler this week. \u201cThis is the playoffs, man,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cPrice is a good dude, but he\u2019s wearing a different uniform.\u201dThe regrettable reign of Frank McCourt as Dodgers owner had its roots in South Boston parking lots. McCourt, a Boston native and real estate developer, had initially hoped to buy the Red Sox and build a new stadium on his 24-acre waterfront lot. When the Red Sox sold instead to John Henry\u2019s group \u2014 essentially saving beloved Fenway Park \u2014 McCourt focused on the Dodgers, using the Boston property as collateral for some of the financing. Each team has a starting pitcher who played for the other one: Boston\u2019s Nathan Eovaldi came up with the Dodgers, and L.A.\u2019s Rich Hill revived his career with the Red Sox. Many retired stars played for both teams, including Nomar Garciaparra, Ramon and Pedro Martinez, Manny Ramirez and Reggie Smith. Two Bay Area icons, Rickey Henderson and Juan Marichal, ended their Hall of Fame careers with brief stints for both teams. The only player with 2,000 at-bats for both teams is Bill Buckner, who homered for the Dodgers in the 1974 World Series and was a such a valued member of the 1986 Red Sox that Manager John McNamara left him in at first base in the bottom of the 10th inning of Game 6 against the Mets, just so Buckner could be on the field when the Red Sox won it all. (This plan did not work.)Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Nominee Draws Scrutiny for Ties to Ukrainian Energy Interests", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe head of that team, William N. Bryan, was a career civil servant with an expertise in energy infrastructure and security.But he was a neophyte when it came to the notoriously factional and corrupt world of Ukrainian politics. And it was not long before American and Ukrainian government officials began raising concerns that he was being co-opted by a Ukrainian company seen as aligned with a prominent oligarch \u2014 concerns that grew when Mr. Bryan later joined a consulting firm that pursued business proposals with the company.Now, four years later, those relationships are attracting new scrutiny as Mr. Bryan awaits a Senate confirmation vote to become President Trump\u2019s homeland security under secretary for science and technology.Mr. Bryan said he followed all the rules and made very little money from the private business with Ukrainian entities.As part of the confirmation process, the Senate is examining Mr. Bryan\u2019s relationship with the founders of the Ukrainian company, the Energy Industry Research Center, and his work for the Ukrainian government-owned gas company, Naftogaz.A federal investigative agency is looking into a former colleague\u2019s accusations that Mr. Bryan used his Energy Department position to try to steer government funds to the center, which United States and Ukrainian officials believe to be aligned with Rinat Akhmetov, a billionaire oligarch who maintains close connections to pro-Russia political forces in Ukraine.Mr. Bryan has not been charged with any wrongdoing. In an interview, he said that he \u201cnever made a dime off any of the people I knew from the Ukraine, deliberately, because I didn\u2019t want to violate any of the ethics rules.\u201dWhile operating under that designation at the Energy Department, Mr. Bryan was affiliated with a Virginia consulting firm, ValueBridge International, and he remained with the firm after he left the Energy Department in mid-2016.The overlap between his Energy Department work and ValueBridge\u2019s efforts, revealed in documents and interviews, underscores the lure of big money that is often dangled in front of Washington officials and consultants by powerful foreign interests looking to shape American politics and policy. It also highlights the difficulty in discerning the motivations of those interests.The whistle-blower complaint against Mr. Bryan was filed by Robert Ivy, who worked with Mr. Bryan on the Ukraine project when both men were officials at the Energy Department.Represented by John N. Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit law firm, Mr. Ivy, who remains employed by the Energy Department, filed the complaint last month with the United States Office of Special Counsel, a federal agency that investigates whistle-blower complaints.The complaint, which was obtained by The New York Times, accuses Mr. Bryan of violating ethics rules by working on matters in which he had a financial interest, and of shaping Energy Department policy to benefit Mr. Akhmetov and his allies in exchange for \u201cvaluable promises of future private business dealings.\u201dMr. Akhmetov, whose net worth is estimated to be $5.7 billion, looms large over Ukrainian politics \u2014 and he in some ways set in motion the sequence of events that resulted in the special counsel\u2019s case against Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.And as the team in Ukraine prepared for its second winter in 2015, some Ukrainian and American officials began questioning whether Mr. Bryan was carrying water for Mr. Akhmetov. They specifically raised concerns about Mr. Bryan\u2019s reliance on data, analysis and recommendations provided by the Energy Industry Research Center, a company widely seen as aligned with Mr. Akhmetov and sometimes in conflict with American priorities for helping Ukraine\u2019s government reduce oligarchs\u2019 influence and stand up to Russia.American officials took the concerns seriously, with one flagging them for an Energy Department political appointee, who responded that \u201cthe reality of Ukraine is that almost everybody is carrying someone else\u2019s water.\u201dThe center has \u201cprovided analytical services\u201d to Mr. Akhmetov\u2019s company, DTEK, and other companies, a DTEK spokeswoman said, but she added that DTEK does not fund the center.Vadym Glamazdin, a founder of the Energy Industry Research Center who worked closely with Mr. Bryan in Ukraine, said the company \u201chas absolutely no connections to Akhmetov.\u201d He said he remains friends with Mr. Bryan, and praised his work in Ukraine as selfless. \u201cWe were able to get through the winters of 2014 and 2015 to a great extent because of the work of Bill and his team, and I, as a Ukrainian, am grateful for what they did for us.\u201dMr. Bryan said he was referred to the center by the Ukrainian government, but had nothing to do with allocating government funds to it.Within a few months of the emails and the letter airing concerns about his relationship with the Energy Industry Research Center, Mr. Bryan retired as a full-time Energy Department official, went on \u201cspecial government employee\u201d status and joined ValueBridge to start an energy consulting practice.Not long afterward, ValueBridge teamed up with the center on a bid for funding from the United States Agency for International Development for a project in Ukraine related to energy and economic development, according to documents and interviews. The proposal was prepared and submitted even as Mr. Bryan continued working with the center as an Energy Department employee.Mr. Bryan left the department for good in mid-2016 and went to work full time at ValueBridge. It signed a contract in February 2017 to represent Naftogaz, the Ukrainian gas company.Mr. Bryan said he made only $4,200 for organizing the Houston event. He said he ultimately lost money at ValueBridge because he dipped into personal funds for business development.Advertisement"}

Video lottery operators held a hog roast. Truckers put on an ice cream sundae social. Beer distributors organized an especially sought-after gathering featuring plenty of samples. And the American Legislative Exchange Council, known for drafting conservative-leaning model legislation, hosted a wine and cheese party.South Dakota voters were sufficiently fed up in 2016 to pass a statewide ethics initiative that was meant to diminish the influence of lobbyists. But the Legislature in Pierre, the state capital, swiftly struck back: It repealed the referendum and replaced it with its own slate of bills, which critics denounced as a watered-down substitute \u2014 and a slap in the face to voters.Voters responded by placing a new ethics initiative on the November ballot, and the issue is again rattling the state\u2019s political order.Over the past two years, governors and state legislatures around the nation have used an array of tools to overturn, delay, diminish or pre-emptively declare unconstitutional a variety of initiatives approved by the same voters who put them in office. Those moves follow a rise in efforts by residents to enact their own legislation, in a growing battle over who will make laws \u2014 legislators or voters.In 2016, 71 initiatives were brought forward by voters; 46 were approved, and legislatures changed or sought to alter nearly one-quarter of those. Sixty-five more measures are expected to appear on ballots next month.In decades past, no one tracked the number of ballot initiatives that were overturned by politicians, but experts say they have noted a significant increase lately.One indication of how bad things have gotten: Officials have resorted to doing something that politicians usually studiously avoid, openly questioning the choices of their own constituents.And in Oklahoma, legislators said that voters simply did not understand what they were doing when they approved a criminal justice overhaul in 2016. Almost immediately, the Legislature sought to overturn it.\u201cWhen one party dominates, our elected representatives think they can do a lot of things with impunity, as long as they cater to their base,\u201d Dr. Matsusaka said. \u201cPeople feel like, \u2018I know this issue. Why can\u2019t I make these decisions?\u2019\u201dAmendment W calls for creating an ethics board that could conduct audits and investigate potential ethics lapses by South Dakota politicians, including bribery and violations of lobbying rules and campaign finance laws. This time around, supporters of the measure wrote the initiative as a constitutional amendment, so that elected officials would not be able to alter or repeal it if it passes.David Owen, president of the state Chamber of Commerce, who is leading the campaign opposing the initiative, said lobbyists in the state play an important role in educating legislators about topics in which lobbyists have expertise. A law limiting that work, he said, would be both unnecessary and harmful.\u201cWe decided, good Lord, this is a wreck and a direct threat to our ability to communicate,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact is, I don\u2019t think we have corruption in the Legislature.\u201dHe paused, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s different than saying everyone should love their legislation.\u201dBlake Curd, the Republican Senate majority leader, supported repealing the state\u2019s 2016 ethics initiative, and opposes the new ballot measure. He said both measures are probably unconstitutional and would be too expensive to administer.Mr. Curd, an orthopedic surgeon, said he has sensed little displeasure among residents over the way lawmakers operate or over the repeal of the ethics initiative.\u201cThe average critter that I run into on a daily basis doesn\u2019t have that angst,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do toward D.C., but here? I don\u2019t see it as much.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A New Taste of Marrakesh", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "Personal JourneysThe ancient Moroccan city is being reinvigorated by local entrepreneurs opening their own cafes, bars and riads, while embracing tradition.Supported byTwenty years after my first visit, some things about Marrakesh remain remarkably similar. The medina \u2014 the labyrinthine old part of the city \u2014 is still partly populated by stooped men in djellabas and the occasional donkey-led cart. The late afternoon light hits the high walls of its alleys in warming hues of yellow and orange. It still feels, at times, that everyone wants to sell you something.Around dusk, the Jemaa el Fna, the medina\u2019s main square, still goes through the same transformation: Juice vendors and the occasional snake charmer are replaced by a dizzying array of food stalls and circles of musicians.Perhaps the most transformative change: Twenty years ago, I struggled to connect, using my barely conversational French; now almost anyone under the age of 35 or 40 speaks English (and, often, not French).But I could never get Marrakesh and Morocco out of my head. Soon after my trip, I started working at The New York Times and, years later, as an editor in the Travel section. This time, I could return as a journalist.Since my first trip, Marrakesh has become Morocco\u2019s premier tourist city. For decades it has attracted travelers, though at a much smaller scale. \u201cEverybody knows everybody else in Marrakesh,\u201d wrote the English author Peter Mayne in his 1953 memoir, \u201cA Year in Marrakesh.\u201d \u201cAt least everybody knows everyone who lives here \u2014 the tourists who come in for a look at the city and a taste of its delights don\u2019t count, except to have francs taken off them.\u201dBut unlike cosmopolitan Casablanca, or Tangier, which, being a short ferry ride away from Spain, had the chaotic transience of a border town, Marrakesh has stayed both exciting and accessible for Western travelers.In Morocco\u2019s \u201cJewel of the South,\u201d the streets and bazaars spill over with artistry, whether it be in architecture, cuisine, crafts or fine art.Twenty years ago, I spent most of my time with nonnative travelers: a couple of strong-willed Italian women whom I met haggling in the medina; two Japanese women that we joined up with for a trek into the Sahara, the last part by camel; Spanish students on a budget even tighter than mine (one night we dined on canned tuna and r\u2019ghayef, Moroccan flatbread, on a medina sidewalk).This time around, I desperately wanted to connect with native Moroccans who were doing interesting, creative things. I discovered a vibrant cultural scene, one filled with men and women who care deeply about celebrating their city and country \u2014 but who are fighting an uphill battle against a lack of support from the Moroccan government and that influx of expats.Over tea and Moroccan pastries, I asked Mr. Ait Ben Abdallah, 56, who owns six riads around the medina (and another in Fez; he rents the Dar Cherifa space), if he was the exception or the rule as a native riad owner. The exception, he said, estimating that 90 to 95 percent are owned by foreigners. But that didn\u2019t exactly bother him.\u201cThirty years ago, Moroccans didn\u2019t want to live in the medina,\u201d he said in French, as Abdellah translated. The foreigners, he said, were helping support an infrastructure \u2014 and moreover, the very existence of the medina, where centuries-old properties were being destroyed. \u201cI would sell riads to the devil if it helped me get Moroccans to open their eyes to how the medina is being destroyed.\u201dMr. Ait Ben Abdallah was born outside the city and moved to his aunt\u2019s house in the medina at age 7. As a successful entrepreneur, he now wanted to give back, not just by renovating riads, but by educating children in his hometown, where he runs cultural events that provide arts education. He employs about 120 people at his properties, and at Dar Cherifa, he hosts free readings, a restaurant and exhibitions.\u201cWorking in heritage is important,\u201d he said, smiling broadly, \u201cbut creating jobs really matters more.\u201dA few of the women brought in a large tray, singing a joyful prayer as they did, and we sat down to a feast of couscous. We dug in as Ms. El Falahi, told us her tale.A decade ago, the village had been populated by drug users and delinquents. She called the authorities and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get a bulldozer and we\u2019re going to build a co-op.\u201d To everyone\u2019s astonishment, she did just that. She now employs 40 women (some of whom, in this traditional community, had previously not been allowed to even leave their homes), sent 30 of them to earn their degrees, and has opened 19 more cooperatives around the country. The co-op has since received funding from the National Initiative for Human Development; it probably doesn\u2019t hurt that they make a gluten-free couscous for the royal family.Barom\u00e8tre is the brainchild of two Marrakeshis, Hamza and Soufiane Hadni, brothers who opened the bar and restaurant in 2016. Soufiane, 34, is tall, with a ponytail and a pokerfaced expression. Hamza, 29, is shorter and a smooth talker. They both wore beards and the sort of structural glasses you might find on an architect.Before opening Barom\u00e8tre, neither had any experience at bars. \u201cWe had this dream of doing something together,\u201d Hamza said, as Abdellah and I surveyed the bar, which was stocked with syrups, infusions and garnishes. The dream had been accomplished: The place is popular with both locals and tourists.Both the menu and glassware (each glass paired to a specific cocktail) were elaborate almost to the point of absurdity. I chose the Churchill, an old-fashioned variation made with cognac, whiskey, thyme honey, orange, cinnamon and date-nut smoke, the last of which was created by torching the nuts, then lowering a glass to contain the smoke.I had to give the Hadni brothers points for passion and ambition, especially considering their limitations (every drink involving whiskey used Jack Daniel\u2019s; spirits are hard to come by in Morocco). But my inner cocktail snob couldn\u2019t help but note that spirits were measured with a jigger, while juices and infusions were not; and my Manhattan variation (with a syrup made from local carob) was not sufficiently diluted. There is also an impressive food menu \u2014 I had mhamsa (a type of Moroccan pasta) made risotto-style, with clams and a saffron emulsion \u2014 by the Marrakeshi chef, Badr Chguifi.Still, it was clear the brothers shared a quality with everyone I met on my trip. \u201cThe common thing among all these people,\u201d said Abdellah, between sips of a Casablanca beer, \u201ceveryone is passionate about what they do.\u201dI ducked into a courtyard that was whitewashed and pleasantly spartan, and was greeted by Laila Hida, 34, who founded the space in 2013. We sat down at a wooden table in the middle of the courtyard; pieces of art of various sorts \u2014 photographic, multimedia, sculptural \u2014 were scattered on the walls. Ms. Hida is taciturn in a thoughtful way, with long, dark hair and a mischievous smile.Le 18 had begun as a way to connect young artistic Marrakeshi. \u201cLittle by little the community got bigger,\u201d Ms. Hida said. \u201cWithout choosing to become a cultural space, that\u2019s what we became.\u201d Within the first year, Le 18 hosted about 20 events \u2014 and now presents exhibitions, talks, performances and screenings. It has also just put out its first magazine, Chergui (named after a warm wind from the Sahara) \u2014 \u201cwithout anything, without money\u201d from the government, she added.\u201cNo one will help you from the state, from the ministries,\u201d Ms. Hida said. \u201cThere is no place for organizations, for artists that are not within the voice that the states wants to bring up.\u201dStill, Ms. Hida and other creative types reflect the medina\u2019s energy, at turns frenetic and languid. \u201cIt\u2019s a great richness, being in the medina,\u201d she said, as we lunched on kefta tagine. \u201cIt\u2019s made us think about how to be humble.\u201dAfter my meeting with Ms. Hida, I headed back to the Jemaa el Fna for a final dinner. I watched as its daily transformation began: juice vendors making way for sellers of snail soup and sheep\u2019s head. The sun went down and the square swarmed with activity. It all felt surprisingly familiar.An earlier version of this article misstated Abdellatif Ait Ben Abdallah\u2019s relationship to the Marrakesh riad Dar Cherifa. He rents the space, he does not own it. (He does own seven other properties, six in Marrakesh and one in Fez.)Dan Saltzstein, a former editor in Travel, is interim editorial director for Special Projects at The Times.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Markets Have Surged on Hope of Bolsonaro Victory. Can He Deliver?", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Looking at Brazil\u2019s rallying stock market and stronger currency, it might seem as if Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing presidential candidate favored by investors, had already won and the country was bouncing back from its painful recession.Mr. Bolsonaro has a substantial lead over his left-wing rival, Fernando Haddad, in Sunday\u2019s election.\u201cThe financial market is deluding itself with the promise of a liberal economic program\u201d from Mr. Bolsonaro, Mr. Schwartsman said.Part of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s appeal lies not in what he stands for, but in what he stands against.This election has effectively become, for investors and for many Brazilians, a referendum on Mr. Haddad\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, or PT. It governed Brazil through a boom-and-bust cycle from 2003 to 2016. Many Brazilians blame the PT for the country\u2019s economic decline \u2014 and Mr. Bolsonaro was remarkably effective in presenting himself as the leftist party\u2019s polar opposite.\u201cIf the markets are a little apprehensive about Bolsonaro, they should feel completely insecure when it comes to the PT,\u201d said Gustavo Bebianno, the president of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s Social Liberal Party.The vote comes as the nation, home to the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy, is struggling to emerge from a brutal economic downturn. That slump \u2014 worsened by a political crisis and a widespread corruption scandal \u2014 has left nearly 13 million people unemployed.Without swift and largely unpopular measures \u2014 including pension reform \u2014 the fiscal deficit and public debt could balloon out of control and push the country back into recession.But Mr. Bolsonaro is not your average business-friendly conservative. With his abrasive rhetoric, shoot-first approach to fighting crime and socially conservative agenda, he is more often compared with leaders like President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines than with traditional free-trade minded fiscal conservatives.When asked about the economy, Mr. Bolsonaro professes ignorance and points to his would-be finance minister, Paulo Guedes, a University of Chicago-educated and market-friendly economist handpicked to reassure the business elite.Central to Mr. Guedes\u2019 ambitious plan for the economy is to put every public company and property \u2014 including the state-run electricity giant Eletrobras and the giant oil company Petrobras \u2014 on the auction block to raise over $400 billion.That, he argues, would reduce public debt while crucial pension reform is hammered out.But when asked about the idea during a recent television interview, Mr. Bolsonaro torpedoed it.\u201cAre you going to privatize in exchange for anybody\u2019s money?\u201d he said. \u201cChina isn\u2019t buying in Brazil, China is buying Brazil! Are you going to leave our energy in the hands of the Chinese?\u201dDuring his seven terms as a lawmaker, Mr. Bolsonaro voted against privatizations, calling the landmark breakup and sale of the telecommunications monopoly a \u201cbarbarity.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, has defended Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship and alienated many voters with incendiary attacks on women, blacks and gays. Nonetheless, he handily won the first round of voting, in part by positioning himself as the wrecking ball willing to demolish the political establishment Brazilians were so furious with after years of corruption scandals and economic turmoil.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s embrace by investors came late in the game, with influential groups like the agribusiness lobby endorsing him just days before the first round of elections.As the race narrowed, markets sided with Mr. Bolsonaro over Mr. Haddad, who became the Workers\u2019 Party candidate after the courts deemed the former president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the party\u2019s de facto leader, ineligible to run because he was convicted of money laundering and corruption. He is serving a 12-year sentence.Many Brazilians hold the Workers\u2019 Party responsible not only for the multibillion-dollar bribery scheme uncovered by a corruption investigation known as Lava Jato, or Carwash, but also for the deep recession that began under Mr. da Silva\u2019s chosen successor, former president Dilma Rousseff.Vanessa Gomes, a real estate broker in S\u00e3o Paulo, is among those who want a change.\u201cWe know what 14 years of the PT brought \u2014 high interest rates and high unemployment,\u201d she said. \u201cProperties have been sitting on the market for two years. Bolsonaro is going to change that. I\u2019ve already got clients just waiting for elections to be over to buy.\u201dStill, experts are divided over what \u201cBolsonomics\u201d will look like.\u201cI think it\u2019s a massive risk,\u201d said Eduardo Mufarej, a former investment banker who founded the nonpartisan organization RenovaBR, which sought to get political outsiders elected this year.\u201cMarkets are seeing the glass half full now,\u201d Mr. Mufarej said, adding that 2019 will be a crucial year.With lower interest rates, low inflation and a backlog of investments coming to market once elections are over, the economy will almost certainly rebound, Mr. Mufarej predicted. But it might not last long, he said.\u201cIt will be a honeymoon,\u201d he said.But, he added, \u201cUnless structural measures are implemented, like pension reform and tax reform, 2020 will be a completely different story.\u201dAnalysts warn that without drastic measures debt could reach unsustainable levels in the next two years, leaving the government unable to finance itself and pushing the economy back into recession.In Brazil, workers on average retire at 55, earning 70 percent of their final salary. Social security accounts for a third of all government spending, which has contributed to record fiscal deficits. That makes pension reform among the thornier challenges the new president will face.While Mr. Guedes has repeatedly vowed to push an unpopular measure through Congress, Mr. Bolsonaro has again sent mixed signals.\u201cWe can\u2019t penalize those who have already acquired rights,\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro said of draft reform in a recent interview. \u201cWe can play with things, we have ideas and proposals in that sense, but no one will be penalized.\u201dMarkets are optimistic his tune will change once the campaign is over.\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the policy orientation,\u201d said Chris Garman, a Brazil expert at Eurasia Group, pointing out that Mr. Bolsonaro spoke to dozens of economists over the last year, looking for someone with the right liberal credentials. \u201cThe problem is, how much can they get done?\u201dIn pushing through any changes, Mr. Bolsonaro will be up against a fragmented Congress with 30 political parties. He does not have a track record of building coalitions, and has said he will not partake in the traditional horse-trading required to pass legislation in Brazil.Mr. Mufarej, the former investment banker, said Mr. Bolsonaro could lose the chance to act if he doesn\u2019t expand his inner circle beyond mostly military men and entice competent and experienced professionals to critical jobs.To Eurasia\u2019s Mr. Garman, the risk is ending up with watered-down measures.\u201cWe will see compromises along the way,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get pension reform done in a year, we could see a real blowout.\u201dManuela Andreoni contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}

You have them totally clean. They travel all the time. They\u2019re organized. They\u2019re fed.\u201dMr. MacArthur put his hands up.\u201cThat\u2019s more than I know,\u201d he said, dodging the unfounded theorizing, before attempting to strike a more conciliatory tone. \u201cThere is no shame in being both compassionate and having the rule of law. Those two things can exist at the same time.\u201dAs he seeks a third term, Mr. MacArthur embodies the challenge facing many suburban Republicans across the country who have remained staunch allies of the president. Their wealthy and once-reliably Republican districts have become battlegrounds since Mr. Trump\u2019s triumph in 2016 galvanized an angry Democratic electorate.Mr. MacArthur has been forced to walk a fine line in a polarized district. He helped lead an effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which has helped drive down or contain health care costs for many residents, and voted in favor of the federal tax plan, which imposed a limit on local tax deductions and is deeply unpopular in New Jersey. At the same time, Mr. MacArthur likes to tout his bipartisan record, citing his work on the opioid epidemic and his opposition to offshore drilling.Though Mr. Trump won the district, which stretches from the Jersey Shore toward the suburbs of Philadelphia, it has not translated into an advantage for Mr. MacArthur, who is trying to defend his seat against a well-financed challenge from his Democratic opponent, Andy Kim, who worked in the Obama administration on national security issues.\u201cTrump remains more of a motivating factor for his opponents than for his supporters in this particular race,\u201d said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Poll.Mr. MacArthur acknowledges the challenge he faces and points to the layout of his district to illustrate the political dynamics at play.\u201cI try to remind people that I have to straddle the Pine Barrens,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe 1.1-million-acre Pine Barrens that runs through the middle of the state divides my district in half. On the one side is Ocean County, where Trump won by 93,000 votes. And on the other side is Burlington County where he lost by 16 percentage points. I have to straddle that.\u201dOn a swing through the heavily Republican oceanside town of Toms River, Mr. MacArthur interspersed his allegiance to the president with evidence that he is not simply a rubber stamp for Mr. Trump or the party.There was \u201csomething malign in the bosom of the Democratic Party,\u2019\u2019 Mr. MacArthur said starkly, while adding that nevertheless, \u201cI probably spend most of my time working with Democrats.\u201dMr. MacArthur voted in favor of a bill that required all states to recognize concealed-carry gun permits from other states. But, he explained, the legislation also contained a provision opposed by the National Rifle Association that requires a more rigorous background-check system. \u201cWe don\u2019t have that today,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cThat is more dangerous.\u201dAnd though he has supported much of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariff policies, he said he successfully lobbied the administration to drop one tariff that would have harmed a chemical company in Burlington County.\u201cI\u2019m not saying that the president\u2019s popularity has no impact on my race,\u201d Mr. MacArthur said. \u201cOf course it does. But I can look people in the eye and say I work with the president when I can.\u201dMr. MacArthur seems exasperated at times with the anger directed at him for his willingness to side with Mr. Trump. But that anger is what has led to a tectonic shift in this district, which has been represented by Republicans since 1993 except for two years when a Democrat won by riding the coattails of Barack Obama\u2019s historic first victory.The recent Monmouth Poll found that an equal number of voters approve and disapprove of Mr. Trump, which differs from the picture statewide, where the president is intensely unpopular.\u201cTo the degree that hard-core Trump supporters are congregating anywhere in New Jersey, it\u2019s in Ocean County,\u201d said Benjamin Dworkin, a politics professor at Rowan University. \u201cSo MacArthur being as supportive of Trump as he is, it\u2019s as much a political necessity as anything else.\u201dBut Mr. MacArthur\u2019s votes, especially on health care, have been frequent targets of Mr. Kim on the campaign trail and in political advertisements. His vote on the federal tax plan not been as big an issue as it has been elsewhere because the cap deductions has less of an impact on the district.Mr. Kim has focused on an amendment to the Affordable Care act that Mr. MacArthur helped draft and that critics say would undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201cWhat the voters are concerned about is that my opponent is someone who stood alongside the president and his administration on gutting pre-existing condition protections, on essential benefit protections, and the tax bill,\u201d Mr. Kim said at a recent candidate forum.Mr. MacArthur has denied trying to erode safeguards for pre-existing conditions, one of the pillars of health care reform, but Mr. Kim\u2019s line of attack has resonated in the district, with surveys showing that health care is by far the most important issue.That is especially true in Ocean County, which has the largest population of older people of any county in the state.\u201cThe cost of medicine, Medicare, anything that has to do with health and well being of the senior citizens are my top issues,\u201d said Sandra Chmielewski, 74, who went to hear Mr. MacArthur\u2019s stance on health care. \u201cI have to hear more about it.

Another wrote that \u201cIsrael has hypnotized the world\u201d with its \u201cevil doings.\u201dStill another helped write a scathing book on relations between the United States and Israel, while Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a progressive political star expected to win a House seat in New York, condemned the \u201coccupation of Palestine.\u201dA cluster of activist Democrats \u2014 most of them young, most of them cruising toward House seats this fall \u2014 has dared to breach what has been an almost inviolable orthodoxy in both political parties, strong support for Israel, raising the specter of a crack in the Democratic Party that Republicans could use to attract Jewish supporters.\u201cIt has to be one state,\u201d she said. \u201cSeparate but equal does not work.\u201d\u201cI do worry that there are some on the extreme left of our party who adopt slogans\u201d that are creating tensions, said Representative Brad Sherman, Democrat of California and a pro-Israel voice in the party.Others dismissed the newcomers as a fringe, with little influence. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about a handful of people; they\u2019re certainly not going to move Congress\u2019s wall-to-wall support for Israel,\u201d said Ron Halber, the executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington. \u201cCould it turn into a ripple? Perhaps. You have a unique combination of forces right now.\u201dHis greater concern, he said, is that President\u2019s Trump\u2019s friendly relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel is getting Israel\u2019s narrative \u201ccaught up in the anti-Trump fervor, which is not fair to Israel.\u201dRunning on platforms that emphasize opposing discrimination against marginalized groups, candidates have introduced the Palestinian issue as what they call a larger commitment to social justice.\u201cIt\u2019s a position consistent with all their other values,\u201d said Dima Khalidi, the director of Palestine Legal, a Palestinian rights group. \u201cYou cannot take positions on social justice issues, on the border wall, on immigration rights, without addressing the injustices of the Israeli occupation.\u201dMs. Tlaib said in a television interview that she would \u201cabsolutely\u201d slash military aid to Israel, adding, \u201cI will be using my position in Congress so that no country, not one, should be able to get aid from the U.S. when they still promote that kind of injustice.\u201dPro-Israel groups like StandWithUs are concerned that anti-Israel views, promoted and masked by \u201chuman rights language,\u201d will find \u201ca landing space in our political system,\u201d said Peggy Shapiro, the group\u2019s Midwest executive director.\u201cOn the far right it\u2019s easier to spot,\u201d Ms. Shapiro said of hateful language. \u201cOn the far left we have a more complicated challenge because misinformation is often expressed in the language of social justice, and it makes it easier to mislead well-meaning people.\u201dParty leaders and Democrats supportive of Israel have largely remained silent on the issue. Neither Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate minority leader, nor Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, responded to requests for comment.Representative Gene Green, a centrist Democrat from Texas, conceded that \u201cthe last few years it\u2019s been a little tougher\u201d to find members of his party as supportive of Israel as he is. But he attributed Ms. Omar\u2019s and Ms. Tlaib\u2019s comments to a zeal to represent their districts, which he noted have large communities of Middle Eastern immigrants.\u201cDemocrats, we have broad stripes,\u201d Mr. Green said, adding that he expected that within the party \u201cyou\u2019ll still see support for Israel.\u201dMatthew Brooks, the executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition, accused Democratic leaders of failing to push back against \u201chostile\u201d remarks from Democratic candidates.\u201cThat involves policing and enforcing their own and making clear that these views are outside the mainstream,\u201d he said. \u201cSo far they haven\u2019t done that.\u201dBut Republicans are not averse to exploiting the Democratic divisions.The Republican Party of Virginia has laid into Ms. Cockburn, calling her a \u201cvirulent anti-Semite,\u201d a charge she hotly contests.The liberal Jewish group J Street condemned that effort on Wednesday as \u201cone of most ugly, racist campaign ads we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\u201cAnyone trying to use Israel as a political wedge and football doesn\u2019t have Israel\u2019s best interest at heart and should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Democrat of Florida, calling the accusation \u201crevolting.\u201dRepublicans say they will continue to push the issue.\u201cThe fact that this is allowed to metastasize in the Democratic Party without any real pushback,\u201d Mr. Brooks said, his voice trailing off. \u201cIt used to be one of the third rails of politics, especially in the Democratic Party.\u201dAdvertisement"}

His lanky 6-foot-7 frame extended beyond the end of the chair\u2019s leg rest. He added an ottoman to rest his feet.\u201cI\u2019m not good,\u201d said Mr. Volcker, 91, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who came to prominence after he used shockingly high interest rates to help end the runaway inflation of the late 1970s and early \u201980s. Long one of finance\u2019s wise men, he has been sick for several months. But he would rather not talk about himself. Instead, Mr. Volcker wants to talk about the country, the economy and the government. And if he had seemed lethargic when I arrived, he turned lively in his laments: \u201cWe\u2019re in a hell of a mess in every direction,\u201d he said.Hundreds of books surrounded Mr. Volcker \u2014 filling shelves and piled high on virtually every flat surface \u2014 as did pink pages of The Financial Times, folded into origami. \u201cRespect for government, respect for the Supreme Court, respect for the president, it\u2019s all gone,\u201d he said. \u201cEven respect for the Federal Reserve. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really bad. At least the military still has all the respect. But I don\u2019t know, how can you run a democracy when nobody believes in the leadership of the country?\u201d\u201cI had no intention of writing a book, but there was something that kind of was irritating me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about this governance thing.\u201d\u201cThere is no force on earth that can stand up effectively, year after year, against the thousands of individuals and hundreds of millions of dollars in the Washington swamp aimed at influencing the legislative and electoral process,\u201d he wrote in the book.Reagan \u201cdidn\u2019t say a word,\u201d Mr. Volcker wrote. \u201cInstead Baker delivered a message: \u2018The president is ordering you not to raise interest rates before the election.\u2019\u201d Mr. Volcker wasn\u2019t planning to raise rates at the time. The book is not limited to tales of the past, however. It addresses current policy, like the 2 percent inflation target that has become the goal of the Federal Reserve.With a laugh, he told me that he believed the policy was driven by fears of deflation. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t had any deflation in this country for 90 years!\u201dBut there is something more worrisome affecting policy than fear, he told me. Money.Over the din of traffic outside an open window, Mr. Volcker hoarsely sounded an alarm on the power it has to shape our culture and our politics.\u201cThe central issue is we\u2019re developing into a plutocracy,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they\u2019re rich because they\u2019re smart and constructive. And they don\u2019t like government, and they don\u2019t like to pay taxes.\u201d Washington, when he arrived, \u201cwas a city filled with bureaucrats,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make them bad.\u201d At the time, civil servants \u2014 like his father, the township manager of Teaneck, N.J. \u2014 were respected. \u201cI grew up in a world in which good government was a good term,\u201d he said.Schools like the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton, he said, have failed to educate a new generation of civil servants. He said they no longer taught governing but policy \u2014 a shift that he contended allowed them to hold forums and discussions with generals and under secretaries. \u201cRich guys,\u201d he said, \u201clike to go.\u201d He called it \u201chobnobbing wholesale.\u201d \u201cThey can argue war and peace and poverty and everything else,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you go to a school of public policy, you\u2019re not learning how to run the goddamn government. You\u2019re learning how to debate political issues.\u201d Unlike President Barack Obama, who invited Mr. Volcker to consult on economic and regulatory policy \u2014 and asked him if he would be willing to be Treasury secretary, he said \u2014 this White House hasn\u2019t called him. Even so, he has met Mr. Trump twice, both times before he took office.The other was an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Volcker to get Mr. Trump to use \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d to raise money for a charitable organization. \u201cWe had a very nice lunch, and he said, \u2018Interesting idea,\u2019 but put me off otherwise,\u201d Mr. Volcker said.Mr. Volcker is no great fan of the president, but he acknowledged that Mr. Trump had cannily recognized the economic worries of blue-collar workers. Mr. Trump \u201cseized upon some issues that the elite had ignored,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about that, in kind of an erratic way, but there it is.\u201d He wondered how many lectures and presentations he had sat through with economists \u201ctelling us open markets are wonderful, everybody benefits from open markets.\u201dToday, Mr. Volcker is already starting to worry about the next financial crisis. Asked about the stability of the banks, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re in a stronger position than they were, but the honest answer is I don\u2019t know how much they\u2019re manipulating.\u201dThat, he said, is the real challenge facing economic policymakers. \u201cEverybody talks about monetary policy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the lesson of all this is we need better, stronger supervisory powers.\u201dEven as our conversation came to an end, Mr. Volcker looked as if he could keep talking for hours. I told him that, rather than look sick or depressed about the state of the world, he appeared energized. Or, I told him, that was at least the impression he left.\u201cLeave it that way,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Engaged in Suspect Tax Schemes as He Reaped Riches From His Father", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "The president has long sold himself as a self-made billionaire, but a Times investigation found that he received at least $413 million in today\u2019s dollars from his father\u2019s real estate empire, much of it through tax dodges in the 1990s.President Trump participated in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud, that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents, an investigation by The New York Times has found.Mr. Trump won the presidency proclaiming himself a self-made billionaire, and he has long insisted that his father, the legendary New York City builder Fred C. Trump, provided almost no financial help.But The Times\u2019s investigation, based on a vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records, reveals that Mr. Trump received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father\u2019s real estate empire, starting when he was a toddler and continuing to this day.Much of this money came to Mr. Trump because he helped his parents dodge taxes. He and his siblings set up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents, records and interviews show. Records indicate that Mr. Trump helped his father take improper tax deductions worth millions more. He also helped formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents\u2019 real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns, sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings.These maneuvers met with little resistance from the Internal Revenue Service, The Times found. The president\u2019s parents, Fred and Mary Trump, transferred well over $1 billion in wealth to their children, which could have produced a tax bill of at least $550 million under the 55 percent tax rate then imposed on gifts and inheritances.The Trumps paid a total of $52.2 million, or about 5 percent, tax records show.The president declined repeated requests over several weeks to comment for this article. But a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Charles J. Harder, provided a written statement on Monday, one day after The Times sent a detailed description of its findings. \u201cThe New York Times\u2019s allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100 percent false, and highly defamatory,\u201d Mr. Harder said. \u201cThere was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone. The facts upon which The Times bases its false allegations are extremely inaccurate.\u201dMr. Harder sought to distance Mr. Trump from the tax strategies used by his family, saying the president had delegated those tasks to relatives and tax professionals. \u201cPresident Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever with these matters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe affairs were handled by other Trump family members who were not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law.\u201dThe president\u2019s brother, Robert Trump, issued a statement on behalf of the Trump family:\u201cOur dear father, Fred C. Trump, passed away in June 1999. Our beloved mother, Mary Anne Trump, passed away in August 2000. All appropriate gift and estate tax returns were filed, and the required taxes were paid. Our father\u2019s estate was closed in 2001 by both the Internal Revenue Service and the New York State tax authorities, and our mother\u2019s estate was closed in 2004. Our family has no other comment on these matters that happened some 20 years ago, and would appreciate your respecting the privacy of our deceased parents, may God rest their souls.\u201dThe Times\u2019s findings raise new questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to release his income tax returns, breaking with decades of practice by past presidents. According to tax experts, it is unlikely that Mr. Trump would be vulnerable to criminal prosecution for helping his parents evade taxes, because the acts happened too long ago and are past the statute of limitations. There is no time limit, however, on civil fines for tax fraud.The findings are based on interviews with Fred Trump\u2019s former employees and advisers and more than 100,000 pages of documents describing the inner workings and immense profitability of his empire. They include documents culled from public sources \u2014 mortgages and deeds, probate records, financial disclosure reports, regulatory records and civil court files.The investigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records \u2014 bank statements, financial audits, accounting ledgers, cash disbursement reports, invoices and canceled checks. Most notably, the documents include more than 200 tax returns from Fred Trump, his companies and various Trump partnerships and trusts. While the records do not include the president\u2019s personal tax returns and reveal little about his recent business dealings at home and abroad, dozens of corporate, partnership and trust tax returns offer the first public accounting of the income he received for decades from various family enterprises.What emerges from this body of evidence is a financial biography of the 45th president fundamentally at odds with the story Mr. Trump has sold in his books, his TV shows and his political life. In Mr. Trump\u2019s version of how he got rich, he was the master dealmaker who broke free of his father\u2019s \u201ctiny\u201d outer-borough operation and parlayed a single $1 million loan from his father (\u201cI had to pay him back with interest!\u201d) into a $10 billion empire that would slap the Trump name on hotels, high-rises, casinos, airlines and golf courses the world over. In Mr. Trump\u2019s version, it was always his guts and gumption that overcame setbacks. Fred Trump was simply a cheerleader.\u201cI built what I built myself,\u201d Mr. Trump has said, a narrative that was long amplified by often-credulous coverage from news organizations, including The Times.Certainly a handful of journalists and biographers, notably Wayne Barrett, Gwenda Blair, David Cay Johnston and Timothy L. O\u2019Brien, have challenged this story, especially the claim of being worth $10 billion. They described how Mr. Trump piggybacked off his father\u2019s banking connections to gain a foothold in Manhattan real estate. They poked holes in his go-to talking point about the $1 million loan, citing evidence that he actually got $14 million. They told how Fred Trump once helped his son make a bond payment on an Atlantic City casino by buying $3.5 million in casino chips.But The Times\u2019s investigation of the Trump family\u2019s finances is unprecedented in scope and precision, offering the first comprehensive look at the inherited fortune and tax dodges that guaranteed Donald J. Trump a gilded life. The reporting makes clear that in every era of Mr. Trump\u2019s life, his finances were deeply intertwined with, and dependent on, his father\u2019s wealth.By age 3, Mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars from his father\u2019s empire. He was a millionaire by age 8. By the time he was 17, his father had given him part ownership of a 52-unit apartment building. Soon after Mr. Trump graduated from college, he was receiving the equivalent of $1 million a year from his father. The money increased with the years, to more than $5 million annually in his 40s and 50s.Fred Trump\u2019s real estate empire was not just scores of apartment buildings. It was also a mountain of cash, tens of millions of dollars in profits building up inside his businesses, banking records show. In one six-year span, from 1988 through 1993, Fred Trump reported $109.7 million in total income, now equivalent to $210.7 million. It was not unusual for tens of millions in Treasury bills and certificates of deposit to flow through his personal bank accounts each month.Fred Trump was relentless and creative in finding ways to channel this wealth to his children. He made Donald not just his salaried employee but also his property manager, landlord, banker and consultant. He gave him loan after loan, many never repaid. He provided money for his car, money for his employees, money to buy stocks, money for his first Manhattan offices and money to renovate those offices. He gave him three trust funds. He gave him shares in multiple partnerships. He gave him $10,000 Christmas checks. He gave him laundry revenue from his buildings.Much of his giving was structured to sidestep gift and inheritance taxes using methods tax experts described to The Times as improper or possibly illegal. Although Fred Trump became wealthy with help from federal housing subsidies, he insisted that it was manifestly unfair for the government to tax his fortune as it passed to his children. When he was in his 80s and beginning to slide into dementia, evading gift and estate taxes became a family affair, with Donald Trump playing a crucial role, interviews and newly obtained documents show.The line between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion is often murky, and it is constantly being stretched by inventive tax lawyers. There is no shortage of clever tax avoidance tricks that have been blessed by either the courts or the I.R.S. itself. The richest Americans almost never pay anything close to full freight. But tax experts briefed on The Times\u2019s findings said the Trumps appeared to have done more than exploit legal loopholes. They said the conduct described here represented a pattern of deception and obfuscation, particularly about the value of Fred Trump\u2019s real estate, that repeatedly prevented the I.R.S. from taxing large transfers of wealth to his children.\u201cThe theme I see here through all of this is valuations: They play around with valuations in extreme ways,\u201d said Lee-Ford Tritt, a University of Florida law professor and a leading expert in gift and estate tax law. \u201cThere are dramatic fluctuations depending on their purpose.\u201dThe manipulation of values to evade taxes was central to one of the most important financial events in Donald Trump\u2019s life. In an episode never before revealed, Mr. Trump and his siblings gained ownership of most of their father\u2019s empire on Nov. 22, 1997, a year and a half before Fred Trump\u2019s death. Critical to the complex transaction was the value put on the real estate. The lower its value, the lower the gift taxes. The Trumps dodged hundreds of millions in gift taxes by submitting tax returns that grossly undervalued the properties, claiming they were worth just $41.4 million.The same set of buildings would be sold off over the next decade for more than 16 times that amount.The most overt fraud was All County Building Supply & Maintenance, a company formed by the Trump family in 1992. All County\u2019s ostensible purpose was to be the purchasing agent for Fred Trump\u2019s buildings, buying everything from boilers to cleaning supplies. It did no such thing, records and interviews show. Instead All County siphoned millions of dollars from Fred Trump\u2019s empire by simply marking up purchases already made by his employees. Those millions, effectively untaxed gifts, then flowed to All County\u2019s owners \u2014 Donald Trump, his siblings and a cousin. Fred Trump then used the padded All County receipts to justify bigger rent increases for thousands of tenants.After this article was published on Tuesday, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance said the agency was \u201creviewing the allegations\u201d and \u201cvigorously pursuing all appropriate areas of investigation.\u201dAll told, The Times documented 295 streams of revenue that Fred Trump created over five decades to enrich his son. In most cases his four other children benefited equally. But over time, as Donald Trump careened from one financial disaster to the next, his father found ways to give him substantially more money, records show. Even so, in 1990, according to previously secret depositions, Mr. Trump tried to have his father\u2019s will rewritten in a way that Fred Trump, alarmed and angered, feared could result in his empire\u2019s being used to bail out his son\u2019s failing businesses.Of course, the story of how Donald Trump got rich cannot be reduced to handouts from his father. Before he became president, his singular achievement was building the brand of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire, a brand so potent it generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue through TV shows, books and licensing deals.Constructing that image required more than Fred Trump\u2019s money. Just as important were his son\u2019s preternatural marketing skills and always-be-closing competitive hustle. While Fred Trump helped finance the accouterments of wealth, Donald Trump, master self-promoter, spun them into a seductive narrative. Fred Trump\u2019s money, for example, helped build Trump Tower, the talisman of privilege that established his son as a major player in New York. But Donald Trump recognized and exploited the iconic power of Trump Tower as a primary stage for both \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and his presidential campaign.The biggest payday he ever got from his father came long after Fred Trump\u2019s death. It happened quietly, without the usual Trumpian news conference, on May 4, 2004, when Mr. Trump and his siblings sold off the empire their father had spent 70 years assembling with the dream that it would never leave his family.Donald Trump\u2019s cut: $177.3 million, or $236.2 million in today\u2019s dollars.Early experience, cultivated connections and a wave of federal housing subsidies helped Fred Trump lay the foundation of his son\u2019s wealth.Before he turned 20, Fred Trump had already built and sold his first home. At age 35, he was building hundreds of houses a year in Brooklyn and Queens. By 45, he was building some of the biggest apartment complexes in the country.Aside from an astonishing work ethic \u2014 \u201cSleeping is a waste of time,\u201d he liked to say \u2014 the growth reflected his shrewd application of mass-production techniques. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle called him \u201cthe Henry Ford of the home-building industry.\u201d He would erect scaffolding a city block long so his masons, sometimes working a second shift under floodlights, could throw up a dozen rowhouses in a week. They sold for about $115,000 in today\u2019s dollars.By 1940, American Builder magazine was taking notice, devoting a spread to Fred Trump under the headline \u201cBiggest One-Man Building Show.\u201d The article described a swaggering lone-wolf character who paid for everything \u2014 wages, supplies, land \u2014 from a thick wad of cash he carried at all times, and whose only help was a secretary answering the phone in an office barely bigger than a parking space. \u201cHe is his own purchasing agent, cashier, paymaster, building superintendent, construction engineer and sales director,\u201d the article said.It wasn\u2019t that simple. Fred Trump had also spent years ingratiating himself with Brooklyn\u2019s Democratic machine, giving money, doing favors and making the sort of friends (like Abraham D. Beame, a future mayor) who could make life easier for a developer. He had also assembled a phalanx of plugged-in real estate lawyers, property appraisers and tax accountants who protected his interests.All these traits \u2014 deep experience, nimbleness, connections, a relentless focus on the efficient construction of homes for the middle class \u2014 positioned him perfectly to ride a growing wave of federal spending on housing. The wave took shape with the New Deal, grew during the World War II rush to build military housing and crested with the postwar imperative to provide homes for returning G.I.s. Fred Trump would become a millionaire many times over by making himself one of the nation\u2019s largest recipients of cheap government-backed building loans, according to Gwenda Blair\u2019s book \u201cThe Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President.\u201dThose same loans became the wellspring of Donald Trump\u2019s wealth. In the late 1940s, Fred Trump obtained roughly $26 million in federal loans to build two of his largest developments, Beach Haven Apartments, near Coney Island, Brooklyn, and Shore Haven Apartments, a few miles away. Then he set about making his children his landlords.As ground lease payments fattened his children\u2019s trusts, Fred Trump embarked on a far bigger transfer of wealth. Records obtained by The Times reveal how he began to build or buy apartment buildings in Brooklyn and Queens and then gradually, without public trace, transfer ownership to his children through a web of partnerships and corporations. In all, Fred Trump put up nearly $13 million in cash and mortgage debt to create a mini-empire within his empire \u2014 eight buildings with 1,032 apartments \u2014 that he would transfer to his children.The handover began just before Donald Trump\u2019s 16th birthday. On June 1, 1962, Fred Trump transferred a plot of land in Queens to a newly created corporation. While he would be its president, his children would be its owners, records show. Then he constructed a 52-unit building called Clyde Hall.It was easy money for the Trump children. Their father took care of everything. He bought the land, built the apartments and obtained the mortgages. His employees managed the building. The profits, meanwhile, went to his children. By the early 1970s, Fred Trump would execute similar transfers of the other seven buildings.The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.For Donald Trump, this meant a rapidly growing new source of income. When he was in high school, his cut of the profits was about $17,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars. His share exceeded $300,000 a year soon after he graduated from college.How Fred Trump transferred 1,032 apartments to his children without incurring hundreds of thousands of dollars in gift taxes is unclear. A review of property records for the eight buildings turned up no evidence that his children bought them outright. Financial records obtained by The Times reveal only that all of the shares in the partnerships and corporations set up to create the mini-empire shifted at some point from Fred Trump to his children. Yet his tax returns show he paid no gift taxes on seven of the buildings, and only a few thousand dollars on the eighth.That building, Sunnyside Towers, a 158-unit property in Queens, illustrates Fred Trump\u2019s catch-me-if-you-can approach with the I.R.S., which had repeatedly cited him for underpaying taxes in the 1950s and 1960s.Donald Trump went to work for his father after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. His father made him vice president of dozens of companies. This was also the moment Fred Trump telegraphed what had become painfully obvious to his family and employees: He did not consider his eldest son, Fred Trump Jr., a viable heir apparent.Fred Jr., seven and a half years older than Donald, had also worked for his father after college. It did not go well, relatives and former employees said in interviews. Fred Trump openly ridiculed him for being too nice, too soft, too lazy, too fond of drink. He frowned on his interests in flying and music, could not fathom why he cared so little for the family business. Donald, witness to his father\u2019s deepening disappointment, fashioned himself Fred Jr.\u2019s opposite \u2014 the brash tough guy with a killer instinct. His reward was to inherit his father\u2019s dynastic dreams.Fred Trump began taking steps that enriched Donald alone, introducing him to the charms of building with cheap government loans. In 1972, father and son formed a partnership to build a high-rise for the elderly in East Orange, N.J. Thanks to government subsidies, the partnership got a nearly interest-free $7.8 million loan that covered 90 percent of construction costs. Fred Trump paid the rest.But his son received most of the financial benefits, records show. On top of profit distributions and consulting fees, Donald Trump was paid to manage the building, though Fred Trump\u2019s employees handled day-to-day management. He also pocketed what tenants paid to rent air-conditioners. By 1975, Donald Trump\u2019s take from the building was today\u2019s equivalent of nearly $305,000 a year.Fred Trump also gave his son an extra boost through his investment, in the early 1970s, in the sprawling Starrett City development in Brooklyn, the largest federally subsidized housing project in the nation. The investment, which promised to generate huge tax write-offs, was tailor-made for Fred Trump; he would use Starrett City\u2019s losses to avoid taxes on profits from his empire.Fred Trump invested $5 million. A separate partnership established for his children invested $1 million more, showering tax breaks on the Trump children for decades to come. They helped Donald Trump avoid paying any federal income taxes at all in 1978 and 1979. But Fred Trump also deputized him to sell a sliver of his Starrett City shares, a sweetheart deal that generated today\u2019s equivalent of more than $1 million in \u201cconsulting fees.\u201dThe money from consulting and management fees, ground leases, the mini-empire and his salary all combined to make Donald Trump indisputably wealthy years before he sold his first Manhattan apartment. By 1975, when he was 29, he had collected nearly $9 million in today\u2019s dollars from his father, The Times found.Wealthy, yes. But a far cry from the image father and son craved for Donald Trump.Fred Trump would play a crucial role in building and carefully maintaining the myth of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire.\u201cHe is tall, lean and blond, with dazzling white teeth, and he looks ever so much like Robert Redford. He rides around town in a chauffeured silver Cadillac with his initials, DJT, on the plates. He dates slinky fashion models, belongs to the most elegant clubs and, at only 30 years of age, estimates that he is worth \u2018more than $200 million.\u2019\u201dIn the chauffeured Cadillac, Donald Trump took The Times\u2019s reporter on a tour of what he called his \u201cjobs.\u201d He told her about the Manhattan hotel he planned to convert into a Grand Hyatt (his father guaranteed the construction loan), and the Hudson River railroad yards he planned to develop (the rights were purchased by his father\u2019s company). He showed her \u201cour philanthropic endeavor,\u201d the high-rise for the elderly in East Orange (bankrolled by his father), and an apartment complex on Staten Island (owned by his father), and their \u201cflagship,\u201d Trump Village, in Brooklyn (owned by his father), and finally Beach Haven Apartments (owned by his father). Even the Cadillac was leased by his father.\u201cSo far,\u201d he boasted, \u201cI\u2019ve never made a bad deal.\u201dIt was a spectacular con, right down to the priceless moment when Mr. Trump confessed that he was \u201cpublicity shy.\u201d By claiming his father\u2019s wealth as his own, Donald Trump transformed his place in the world. A brash 30-year-old playboy worth more than $200 million proved irresistible to New York City\u2019s bankers, politicians and journalists.Yet for all the spin about cutting his own path in Manhattan, Donald Trump was increasingly dependent on his father. Weeks after The Times\u2019s profile ran, Fred Trump set up still more trusts for his children, seeding each with today\u2019s equivalent of $4.3 million. Even into the early 1980s, when he was already proclaiming himself one of America\u2019s richest men, Donald Trump remained on his father\u2019s payroll, drawing an annual salary of $260,000 in today\u2019s dollars.In theory, the money had to be repaid. In practice, records show, many of the loans were more like gifts. Some were interest-free and had no repayment schedule. Even when loans charged interest, Donald Trump frequently skipped payments.This previously unreported flood of loans highlights a clear pattern to Fred Trump\u2019s largess. When Donald Trump began expensive new projects, his father increased his help. In the late 1970s, when Donald Trump was converting the old Commodore Hotel into a Grand Hyatt, his father stepped up with a spigot of loans. Fred Trump did the same with Trump Tower in the early 1980s.In the mid-1980s, as Donald Trump made his first forays into Atlantic City, Fred Trump devised a plan that sharply increased the flow of money to his son.The plan involved the mini-empire \u2014 the eight buildings Fred Trump had transferred to his children. He converted seven of them into cooperatives, and helped his children convert the eighth. That meant inviting tenants to buy their apartments, generating a three-way windfall for Donald Trump and his siblings: from selling units, from renting unsold units and from collecting mortgage payments.In 1982, Donald Trump made today\u2019s equivalent of about $380,000 from the eight buildings. As the conversions continued and Fred Trump\u2019s employees sold off more units, his son\u2019s share of profits jumped, records show. By 1987, with the conversions completed, his son was making today\u2019s equivalent of $4.5 million a year off the eight buildings.Fred Trump made one other structural change to his empire that produced a big new source of revenue for Donald Trump and his siblings. He made them his bankers.The Times could find no evidence that the Trump children had to come up with money of their own to buy their father\u2019s mortgages. Most were purchased from Fred Trump\u2019s banks by trusts and partnerships that he set up and seeded with money.Co-op sales, mortgage payments, ground leases \u2014 Fred Trump was a master at finding ways to enrich his children in general and Donald Trump in particular. Some ways were like slow-moving creeks. Others were rushing streams. A few were geysers. But as the decades passed they all joined into one mighty river of money. By 1990, The Times found, Fred Trump, the ultimate silent partner, had quietly transferred today\u2019s equivalent of at least $46.2 million to his son.Donald Trump took on a mien of invincibility. The stock market crashed in 1987 and the economy cratered. But he doubled down thanks in part to Fred Trump\u2019s banks, which eagerly extended credit to the young Trump princeling. He bought the Plaza Hotel in 1988 for $407.5 million. He bought the Eastern Airlines shuttle fleet in 1989 for $365 million and called it Trump Shuttle. His newest casino, the Trump Taj Mahal, would need at least $1 million a day just to cover its debt.The skeptics who questioned the wisdom of this debt-fueled spending spree were drowned out by one magazine cover after another marveling at someone so young taking such breathtaking risks. But whatever Donald Trump was gambling, not for one second was he at risk of losing out on a lifetime of frictionless, effortless wealth. Fred Trump had that bet covered.Bailouts, collateral, cash on hand \u2014 Fred Trump was prepared, and was not about to let bad bets sink his son.As the 1980s ended, Donald Trump\u2019s big bets began to go bust. Trump Shuttle was failing to make loan payments within 15 months. The Plaza, drowning in debt, was bankrupt in four years. His Atlantic City casinos, also drowning in debt, tumbled one by one into bankruptcy.Fred Trump\u2019s generosity also provided a crucial backstop when his son pleaded with bankers in 1990 for an emergency line of credit. With so many of his projects losing money, Donald Trump had few viable assets of his own making to pledge as collateral. What has never been publicly known is that he used his stakes in the mini-empire and the high-rise for the elderly in East Orange as collateral to help secure a $65 million loan.Fred Trump, former employees say, detested taking unnecessary distributions from his companies because he would have to pay income taxes on them. So why would a penny-pinching, tax-hating 85-year-old in the twilight of his career abruptly pull so much money out of his cherished properties, incurring a tax bill of $12.2 million?The Times found no evidence that Fred Trump made any significant debt payments or charitable donations. The frugality he brought to business carried over to the rest of his life. According to ledgers of his personal spending, he spent a grand total of $8,562 in 1991 and 1992 on travel and entertainment. His extravagances, such as they were, consisted of buying his wife the odd gift from Antonovich Furs or hosting family celebrations at the Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn. His home on Midland Parkway in Jamaica Estates, Queens, built with unfussy brick like so many of his apartment buildings, had little to distinguish it from neighboring houses beyond the white columns and crest framing the front door.There are, however, indications that he wanted plenty of cash on hand to bail out his son if need be.Such was the case with the rescue mission at his son\u2019s Trump\u2019s Castle casino. Donald Trump had wildly overspent on renovations, leaving the property dangerously low on operating cash. Sure enough, neither Trump\u2019s Castle nor its owner had the necessary funds to make an $18.4 million bond payment due in December 1990.With this ruse \u2014 it was an illegal $3.5 million loan under New Jersey gaming laws, resulting in a $65,000 civil penalty \u2014 Donald Trump narrowly avoided defaulting on his bonds.Both the son and the father were masters of manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs.As the chip episode demonstrated, father and son were of one mind about rules and regulations, viewing them as annoyances to be finessed or, when necessary, ignored. As described by family members and associates in interviews and sworn testimony, theirs was an intimate, endless confederacy sealed by blood, shared secrets and a Hobbesian view of what it took to dominate and win. They talked almost daily and saw each other most weekends. Donald Trump sat at his father\u2019s right hand at family meals and participated in his father\u2019s monthly strategy sessions with his closest advisers. Fred Trump was a silent, watchful presence at many of Donald Trump\u2019s news conferences.\u201cI probably knew my father as well or better than anybody,\u201d Donald Trump said in a 2000 deposition.They were both fluent in the language of half-truths and lies, interviews and records show. They both delighted in transgressing without getting caught. They were both wizards at manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs.Those talents came in handy when Fred Trump Jr. died, on Sept. 26, 1981, at age 42 from complications of alcoholism, leaving a son and a daughter. The executors of his estate were his father and his brother Donald.Fred Trump Jr.\u2019s largest asset was his stake in seven of the eight buildings his father had transferred to his children. The Trumps would claim that those properties were worth $90.4 million when they finished converting them to cooperatives within a few years of his death. At that value, his stake could have generated an estate tax bill of nearly $10 million.This fantastical claim \u2014 that Park Briar should be taxed as if its value had fallen 83 percent in 18 days \u2014 slid past the I.R.S. with barely a protest. An auditor insisted the value should be increased by $100,000, to $3 million.During the 1980s, Donald Trump became notorious for leaking word that he was taking positions in stocks, hinting of a possible takeover, and then either selling on the run-up or trying to extract lucrative concessions from the target company to make him go away. It was a form of stock manipulation with an unsavory label: \u201cgreenmailing.\u201d The Times unearthed evidence that Mr. Trump enlisted his father as his greenmailing wingman.On Jan. 26, 1989, Fred Trump bought 8,600 shares of Time Inc. for $934,854, his tax returns show. Seven days later, Dan Dorfman, a financial columnist known to be chatty with Donald Trump, broke the news that the younger Trump had \u201ctaken a sizable stake\u201d in Time. Sure enough, Time\u2019s shares jumped, allowing Fred Trump to make a $41,614 profit in two weeks.Later that year, Fred Trump bought $5 million worth of American Airlines stock. Based on the share price \u2014 $81.74 \u2014 it appears he made the purchase shortly before Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump was taking a stake in the company. Within weeks, the stock was over $100 a share. Had Fred Trump sold then, he would have made a quick $1.3 million. But he didn\u2019t, and the stock sank amid skepticism about his son\u2019s history of hyped takeover attempts that fizzled. Fred Trump sold his shares for a $1.7 million loss in January 1990. A week later, Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump had sold, too.With other family members, Fred Trump could be cantankerous and cruel, according to sworn testimony by his relatives. \u201cThis is the stupidest thing I ever heard of,\u201d he\u2019d snap when someone disappointed him. He was different with his son Donald. He might chide him \u2014 \u201cFinish this job before you start that job,\u201d he\u2019d counsel \u2014 but more often, he looked for ways to forgive and accommodate.By 1987, for example, Donald Trump\u2019s loan debt to his father had grown to at least $11 million. Yet canceling the debt would have required Donald Trump to pay millions in taxes on the amount forgiven. Father and son found another solution, one never before disclosed, that appears to constitute both an unreported multimillion-dollar gift and a potentially illegal tax write-off.In December 1987, records show, Fred Trump bought a 7.5 percent stake in Trump Palace, a 55-story condominium building his son was erecting on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Most, if not all, of his investment, which totaled $15.5 million, was made by exchanging his son\u2019s unpaid debts for Trump Palace shares, records show.Under state law, developers must file \u201coffering plans\u201d that identify to any potential condo buyer the project\u2019s sponsors \u2014 in other words, its owners. The Trump Palace offering plan, submitted in November 1989, identified two owners: Donald Trump and his father. But under the same law, if Fred Trump had sold his stake to a third party, Donald Trump would have been required to identify the new owner in an amended offering plan filed with the state attorney general\u2019s office. He did not do that, records show.He did, however, sign a sworn affidavit a month after his father sold his stake. In the affidavit, submitted in a lawsuit over a Trump Palace contractor\u2019s unpaid bill, Donald Trump identified himself as \u201cthe\u201d owner of Trump Palace.Under I.R.S. rules, selling shares worth $15.5 million to your son for $10,000 is tantamount to giving him a $15.49 million taxable gift. Fred Trump reported no such gift.According to tax experts, the only circumstance that would not have required Fred Trump to report a gift was if Trump Palace had been effectively bankrupt when he unloaded his shares.Yet Trump Palace was far from bankrupt.Property records show that condo sales there were brisk in 1991. Trump Palace sold 57 condos for $52.5 million \u2014 94 percent of the total asking price for those units.By failing to tell the I.R.S. about his $15.49 million gift to his son, Fred Trump evaded the 55 percent tax on gifts, saving about $8 million. At the same time, he declared to the I.R.S. that Trump Palace was almost a complete loss \u2014 that he had walked away from a $15.5 million investment with just $10,000 to show for it.Federal tax law prohibits deducting any loss from the sale of property between members of the same family, because of the potential for abuse. Yet Fred Trump appears to have done exactly that, dodging roughly $5 million more in income taxes.The partnership between Fred and Donald Trump was not simply about the pursuit of riches. At its heart lay a more ambitious project, executed to perfection over decades \u2014 to create that origin story, the myth of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire.Donald Trump built the foundation for the myth in the 1970s by appropriating his father\u2019s empire as his own. By the late 1980s, instead of appropriating the empire, he was diminishing it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great business, it was a good business,\u201d he said, as if Fred Trump ran a chain of laundromats. Yes, he told interviewers, his father was a wonderful mentor, but given the limits of his business, the most he could manage was a $1 million loan, and even that had to be repaid with interest.Donald Trump tried to change his ailing father\u2019s will, prompting a backlash \u2014 but also a recognition that plans had to be set in motion before Fred Trump died.Fred Trump had given careful thought to what would become of his empire after he died, and had hired one of the nation\u2019s top estate lawyers to draft his will. But in December 1990, Donald Trump sent his father a document, drafted by one of his own lawyers, that sought to make significant changes to that will.Fred Trump, then 85, had never before set eyes on the document, 12 pages of dense legalese. Nor had he authorized its preparation. Nor had he met the lawyer who drafted it.Yet his son sent instructions that he needed to sign it immediately.What happened next was described years later in sworn depositions by members of the Trump family during a dispute, later settled, over the inheritance Fred Trump left to Fred Jr.\u2019s children. These depositions, obtained by The Times, reveal something startling: Fred Trump believed that the document potentially put his life\u2019s work at risk.As close as they were \u2014 or perhaps because they were so close \u2014 Fred Trump did not immediately confront his son. Instead he turned to his daughter Maryanne Trump Barry, then a federal judge whom he often consulted on legal matters. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t pass the smell test,\u201d he told her, she recalled during her deposition. When Judge Barry read the codicil, she reached the same conclusion. \u201cDonald was in precarious financial straits by his own admission,\u201d she said, \u201cand Dad was very concerned as a man who worked hard for his money and never wanted any of it to leave the family.\u201d (In a brief telephone interview, Judge Barry declined to comment.)Fred Trump took prompt action to thwart his son. He dispatched his daughter to find new estate lawyers. One of them took notes on the instructions she passed on from her father: \u201cProtect assets from DJT, Donald\u2019s creditors.\u201d The lawyers quickly drafted a new codicil stripping Donald Trump of sole control over his father\u2019s estate. Fred Trump signed it immediately.Clumsy as it was, Donald Trump\u2019s failed attempt to change his father\u2019s will brought a family reckoning about two related issues: Fred Trump\u2019s declining health and his reluctance to relinquish ownership of his empire. Surgeons had removed a neck tumor a few years earlier, and he would soon endure hip replacement surgery and be found to have mild senile dementia. Yet for all the financial support he had lavished on his children, for all his abhorrence of taxes, Fred Trump had stubbornly resisted his advisers\u2019 recommendations to transfer ownership of his empire to the children to minimize estate taxes.With every passing year, the actuarial odds increased that Fred Trump would die owning apartment buildings worth many hundreds of millions of dollars, all of it exposed to the 55 percent estate tax. Just as exposed was the mountain of cash he was sitting on. His buildings, well maintained and carrying little debt, consistently produced millions of dollars a year in profits. Even after he paid himself $109.7 million from 1988 through 1993, his companies were holding $50 million in cash and investments, financial records show. Tens of millions of dollars more passed each month through a maze of personal accounts at Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, UBS, Bowery Savings and United Mizrahi, an Israeli bank.Simply put, without immediate action, Fred Trump\u2019s heirs faced the prospect of losing hundreds of millions of dollars to estate taxes.Whatever their differences, the Trumps formulated a plan to avoid this fate. How they did it is a story never before told.It is also a story in which Donald Trump played a central role. He took the lead in strategy sessions where the plan was devised with the consent and participation of his father and his father\u2019s closest advisers, people who attended the meetings told The Times. Robert Trump, the youngest sibling and the beta to Donald\u2019s alpha, was given the task of overseeing day-to-day details. After years of working for his brother, Robert Trump went to work for his father in late 1991.The Trumps\u2019 plan, executed over the next decade, blended traditional techniques \u2014 such as rewriting Fred Trump\u2019s will to maximize tax avoidance \u2014 with unorthodox strategies that tax experts told The Times were legally dubious and, in some cases, appeared to be fraudulent. As a result, the Trump children would gain ownership of virtually all of their father\u2019s buildings without having to pay a penny of their own. They would turn the mountain of cash into a molehill of cash. And hundreds of millions of dollars that otherwise would have gone to the United States Treasury would instead go to Fred Trump\u2019s children.A family company let Fred Trump funnel money to his children by effectively overcharging himself for repairs and improvements on his properties. All County had no corporate offices. Its address was the Manhasset, N.Y., home of John Walter, a favorite nephew of Fred Trump\u2019s. Mr. Walter, who died in January, spent decades working for Fred Trump, primarily helping computerize his payroll and billing systems. He also was the unofficial keeper of Fred Trump\u2019s personal and business papers, his basement crowded with boxes of old Trump financial records. John Walter and the four Trump children each owned 20 percent of All County, records show.All County\u2019s main purpose, The Times found, was to enable Fred Trump to make large cash gifts to his children and disguise them as legitimate business transactions, thus evading the 55 percent tax.The way it worked was remarkably simple.Each year Fred Trump spent millions of dollars maintaining and improving his properties. Some of the vendors who supplied his building superintendents and maintenance crews had been cashing Fred Trump\u2019s checks for decades. Starting in August 1992, though, a different name began to appear on their checks \u2014 All County Building Supply & Maintenance.Mr. Walter\u2019s computer systems, meanwhile, churned out All County invoices that billed Fred Trump\u2019s empire for those same services and supplies, with one difference: All County\u2019s invoices were padded, marked up by 20 percent, or 50 percent, or even more, records show.The Trump siblings split the markup, along with Mr. Walter.Years later, in his deposition during the dispute over Fred Trump\u2019s estate, Robert Trump would say that All County actually saved Fred Trump money by negotiating better deals. Given Fred Trump\u2019s long experience expertly squeezing better prices out of contractors, it was a surprising claim. It was also not true.The Times\u2019s examination of thousands of pages of financial documents from Fred Trump\u2019s buildings shows that his costs shot up once All County entered the picture.Beach Haven Apartments illustrates how this happened: In 1991 and 1992, Fred Trump bought 78 refrigerator-stove combinations for Beach Haven from Long Island Appliance Wholesalers. The average price was $642.69. But in 1993, when he began paying All County for refrigerator-stove combinations, the price jumped by 46 percent. Likewise, the price he paid for trash-compacting services at Beach Haven increased 64 percent. Janitorial supplies went up more than 100 percent. Plumbing repairs and supplies rose 122 percent. And on it went in building after building. The more Fred Trump paid, the more All County made, which was precisely the plan.While All County systematically overcharged Fred Trump for thousands of items, the job of negotiating with vendors fell, as it always had, to Fred Trump and his staff.Leon Eastmond can attest to this.Mr. Eastmond is the owner of A. L. Eastmond & Sons, a Bronx company that makes industrial boilers. In 1993, he and Fred Trump met at Gargiulo\u2019s, an old-school Italian restaurant in Coney Island that was one of Fred Trump\u2019s favorites, to hash out the price of 60 boilers. Fred Trump, accompanied by his secretary and Robert Trump, drove a hard bargain. After negotiating a 10 percent discount, he made one last demand: \u201cI had to pay the tab,\u201d Mr. Eastmond recalled with a chuckle.There was no mention of All County. Mr. Eastmond first heard of the company when its checks started rolling in. \u201cI remember opening my mail one day and out came a check for $100,000,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize the company. I didn\u2019t know who the hell they were.\u201dAll County\u2019s owners devised another ruse to profit off Mr. Eastmond\u2019s boilers. To win Fred Trump\u2019s business, Mr. Eastmond had also agreed to provide mobile boilers for Fred Trump\u2019s buildings free of charge while new boilers were being installed. Yet All County charged Fred Trump rent on the same mobile boilers Mr. Eastmond was providing free, along with hookup fees, disconnection fees, transportation fees and operating and maintenance fees, records show. These charges siphoned hundreds of thousands of dollars more from Fred Trump\u2019s empire.Mr. Walter, asked during a deposition why Fred Trump chose not to make himself one of All County\u2019s owners, replied, \u201cHe said because he would have to pay a death tax on it.\u201dAfter being briefed on All County by The Times, Mr. Tritt, the University of Florida law professor, said the Trumps\u2019 use of the company was \u201chighly suspicious\u201d and could constitute criminal tax fraud. \u201cIt certainly looks like a disguised gift,\u201d he said.While All County was all upside for Donald Trump and his siblings, it had an insidious downside for Fred Trump\u2019s tenants.As an owner of rent-stabilized buildings in New York, Fred Trump needed state approval to raise rents beyond the annual increases set by a government board. One way to justify a rent increase was to make a major capital improvement. It did not take much to get approval; an invoice or canceled check would do if the expense seemed reasonable.The Trumps used the padded All County invoices to justify higher rent increases in Fred Trump\u2019s rent-regulated buildings. Fred Trump, according to Mr. Walter, saw All County as a way to have his cake and eat it, too. If he used his \u201cexpert negotiating ability\u201d to buy a $350 refrigerator for $200, he could raise the rent based only on that $200, not on the $350 sticker price \u201ca normal person\u201d would pay, Mr. Walter explained. All County was the way around this problem. \u201cYou have to understand the thinking that went behind this,\u201d he said.As Robert Trump acknowledged in his deposition, \u201cThe higher the markup would be, the higher the rent that might be charged.\u201dState records show that after All County\u2019s creation, the Trumps got approval to raise rents on thousands of apartments by claiming more than $30 million in major capital improvements. Tenants repeatedly protested the increases, almost always to no avail, the records show.One of the improvements most often cited by the Trumps: new boilers.Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, disputed The Times\u2019s reporting: \u201cShould The Times state or imply that President Trump participated in fraud, tax evasion or any other crime, it will be exposing itself to substantial liability and damages for defamation.\u201dOn Jan. 21, 1994, they created a company called Apartment Management Associates Inc., with a mailing address at Mr. Walter\u2019s Manhasset home. Two months later, records show, Apartment Management started collecting fees that had previously gone to Trump Management.The only difference was that Donald Trump and his siblings owned Apartment Management.But these savings were trivial compared with those that would come when Fred Trump transferred his empire \u2014 the actual bricks and mortar \u2014 to his children.The transfer of most of Fred Trump\u2019s empire to his children began with a \u2018friendly\u2019 appraisal and an incredible shrinking act.Six months later, on Nov. 22, the Trumps began transferring ownership of most of Fred Trump\u2019s empire. (A few properties were excluded.) The instrument they used to do this was a special type of trust with a clunky acronym only a tax lawyer could love: GRAT, short for grantor-retained annuity trust.GRATs are one of the tax code\u2019s great gifts to the ultrawealthy. They let dynastic families like the Trumps pass wealth from one generation to the next \u2014 be it stocks, real estate, even art collections \u2014 without paying a dime of estate taxes.The details are numbingly complex, but the mechanics are straightforward. For the Trumps, it meant putting half the properties to be transferred into a GRAT in Fred Trump\u2019s name and the other half into a GRAT in his wife\u2019s name. Then Fred and Mary Trump gave their children roughly two-thirds of the assets in their GRATs. The children bought the remaining third by making annuity payments to their parents over the next two years. By Nov. 22, 1997, it was done; the Trump children owned nearly all of Fred Trump\u2019s empire free and clear of estate taxes.As for gift taxes, the Trumps found a way around those, too.The entire transaction turned on one number: the market value of Fred Trump\u2019s empire. This determined the amount of gift taxes Fred and Mary Trump owed for the portion of the empire they gave to their children. It also determined the amount of annuity payments their children owed for the rest.The I.R.S. recognizes that GRATs create powerful incentives to greatly undervalue assets, especially when those assets are not publicly traded stocks with transparent prices. Indeed, every $10 million reduction in the valuation of Fred Trump\u2019s empire would save the Trumps either $10 million in annuity payments or $5.5 million in gift taxes. This is why the I.R.S. requires families taking advantage of GRATs to submit independent appraisals and threatens penalties for those who lowball valuations.In practice, though, gift tax returns get little scrutiny from the I.R.S. It is an open secret among tax practitioners that evasion of gift taxes is rampant and rarely prosecuted. Punishment, such as it is, usually consists of an auditor\u2019s requiring a tax payment closer to what should have been paid in the first place. \u201cGRATs are typically structured so that no tax is due, which means the I.R.S. has reduced incentive to audit them,\u201d said Mitchell Gans, a professor of tax law at Hofstra University. \u201cSo if a gift is in fact undervalued, it may very well go unnoticed.\u201dThis appears to be precisely what the Trumps were counting on. The Times found evidence that the Trumps dodged hundreds of millions of dollars in gift taxes by submitting tax returns that grossly undervalued the real estate assets they placed in Fred and Mary Trump\u2019s GRATs.The methods the Trumps used to pull off this incredible shrinking act were hatched in the strategy sessions Donald Trump participated in during the early 1990s, documents and interviews show. Their basic strategy had two components: Get what is widely known as a \u201cfriendly\u201d appraisal of the empire\u2019s worth, then drive that number even lower by changing the ownership structure to make the empire look less valuable to the I.R.S.A crucial step was finding a property appraiser attuned to their needs. As anyone who has ever bought or sold a home knows, appraisers can arrive at sharply different valuations depending on their methods and assumptions. And like stock analysts, property appraisers have been known to massage those methods and assumptions in ways that coincide with their clients\u2019 interests.The Trumps used Robert Von Ancken, a favorite of New York City\u2019s big real estate families. Over a 45-year career, Mr. Von Ancken has appraised many of the city\u2019s landmarks, including Rockefeller Center, the World Trade Center, the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. Donald Trump recruited him after Fred Trump Jr. died and the family needed friendly appraisals to help shield the estate from taxes.Mr. Von Ancken appraised the 25 apartment complexes and other properties in the Trumps\u2019 GRATs and concluded that their total value was $93.9 million, tax records show.To assess the accuracy of those valuations, The Times examined the prices paid for comparable apartment buildings that sold within a year of Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s appraisals. A pattern quickly emerged. Again and again, buildings in the same neighborhood as Trump buildings sold for two to four times as much per square foot as Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s appraisals, even when the buildings were decades older, had fewer amenities and smaller apartments, and were deemed less valuable by city property tax appraisers.Mr. Von Ancken valued Argyle Hall, a six-story brick Trump building in Brooklyn, at $9.04 per square foot. Six blocks away, another six-story brick building, two decades older, had sold a few months earlier for nearly $30 per square foot. He valued Belcrest Hall, a Trump building in Queens, at $8.57 per square foot. A few blocks away, another six-story brick building, four decades older with apartments a third smaller, sold for $25.18 per square foot.The pattern persisted with Fred Trump\u2019s higher-end buildings. Mr. Von Ancken appraised Lawrence Towers, a Trump building in Brooklyn with spacious balcony apartments, at $24.54 per square foot. A few months earlier, an apartment building abutting car repair shops a mile away, with units 20 percent smaller, had sold for $48.23 per square foot.The Times found even starker discrepancies when comparing the GRAT appraisals against appraisals commissioned by the Trumps when they had an incentive to show the highest possible valuations.Such was the case with Patio Gardens, a complex of nearly 500 apartments in Brooklyn.Of all Fred Trump\u2019s properties, Patio Gardens was one of the least profitable, which may be why he decided to use it as a tax deduction. In 1992, he donated Patio Gardens to the National Kidney Foundation of New York/New Jersey, one of the largest charitable donations he ever made. The greater the value of Patio Gardens, the bigger his deduction. The appraisal cited in Fred Trump\u2019s 1992 tax return valued Patio Gardens at $34 million, or $61.90 a square foot.By contrast, Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s GRAT appraisals found that the crown jewels of Fred Trump\u2019s empire, Beach Haven and Shore Haven, with five times as many apartments as Patio Gardens, were together worth just $23 million, or $11.01 per square foot.In an interview, Mr. Von Ancken said that because neither he nor The Times had the working papers that described how he arrived at his valuations, there was simply no way to evaluate the methodologies behind his numbers. \u201cThere would be explanations within the appraisals to justify all the values,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBasically, when we prepare these things, we feel that these are going to be presented to the Internal Revenue Service for their review, and they better be right.\u201dOf all the GRAT appraisals Mr. Von Ancken did for the Trumps, the most startling was for 886 rental apartments in two buildings at Trump Village, a complex in Coney Island. Mr. Von Ancken claimed that they were worth less than nothing \u2014 negative $5.9 million, to be exact. These were the same 886 units that city tax assessors valued that same year at $38.1 million, and that a bank would value at $106.6 million in 2004.It appears Mr. Von Ancken arrived at his negative valuation by departing from the methodology that he has repeatedly testified is most appropriate for properties like Trump Village, where past years\u2019 profits are a poor gauge of future value.In 1992, the Trumps had removed the two Trump Village buildings from an affordable housing program so they could raise rents and increase their profits. But doing so cost them a property tax exemption, which temporarily put the buildings in the red. The methodology described by Mr. Von Ancken would have disregarded this blip into the red and valued the buildings based on the higher rents the Trumps would be charging. Mr. Von Ancken, however, appears to have based his valuation on the blip, producing an appraisal that, taken at face value, meant Fred Trump would have had to pay someone millions of dollars to take the property off his hands.Mr. Von Ancken told The Times that he did not recall which appraisal method he used on the two Trump Village buildings. \u201cI can only say that we value the properties based on market information, and based on the expected income and expenses of the building and what they would sell for,\u201d he said. As for the enormous gaps between his valuation and the 1995 city property tax appraisal and the 2004 bank valuation, he argued that such comparisons were pointless. \u201cI can\u2019t say what happened afterwards,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they increased the income tremendously.\u201dTo further whittle the empire\u2019s valuation, the family created the appearance that Fred Trump held only 49.8 percent.Armed with Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s $93.9 million appraisal, the Trumps focused on slashing even this valuation by changing the ownership structure of Fred Trump\u2019s empire.The I.R.S. has long accepted the idea that ownership with control is more valuable than ownership without control. Someone with a controlling interest in a building can decide if and when the building is sold, how it is marketed and what price to accept. However, since someone who owns, say, 10 percent of a $100 million building lacks control over any of those decisions, the I.R.S. will let him claim that his stake should be taxed as if it were worth only $7 million or $8 million.But Fred Trump had exercised total control over his empire for more than seven decades. With rare exceptions, he owned 100 percent of his buildings. So the Trumps set out to create the fiction that Fred Trump was a minority owner. All it took was splitting the ownership structure of his empire. Fred and Mary Trump each ended up with 49.8 percent of the corporate entities that owned his buildings. The other 0.4 percent was split among their four children.Splitting ownership into minority interests is a widely used method of tax avoidance. There is one circumstance, however, where it has at times been found to be illegal. It involves what is known in tax law as the step transaction doctrine \u2014 where it can be shown that the corporate restructuring was part of a rapid sequence of seemingly separate maneuvers actually conceived and executed to dodge taxes. A key issue, according to tax experts, is timing \u2014 in the Trumps\u2019 case, whether they split up Fred Trump\u2019s empire just before they set up the GRATs.In all, the Trumps broke up 12 corporate entities to create the appearance of minority ownership. The Times could not determine when five of the 12 companies were divided. But records reveal that the other seven were split up just before the GRATs were established.The pattern was clear. For decades, the companies had been owned solely by Fred Trump, each operating a different apartment complex or shopping center. In September 1995, the Trumps formed seven new limited liability companies. Between Oct. 31 and Nov. 8, they transferred the deeds to the seven properties into their respective L.L.C.\u2019s. On Nov. 21, they recorded six of the deed transfers in public property records. (The seventh was recorded on Nov. 24.) And on Nov. 22, 49.8 percent of the shares in these seven L.L.C.\u2019s was transferred into Fred Trump\u2019s GRAT and 49.8 percent into Mary Trump\u2019s GRAT.That enabled the Trumps to slash Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s valuation in a way that was legally dubious. They claimed that Fred and Mary Trump\u2019s status as minority owners, plus the fact that a building couldn\u2019t be sold as easily as a share of stock, entitled them to lop 45 percent off Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s $93.9 million valuation. This claim, combined with $18.3 million more in standard deductions, completed the alchemy of turning real estate that would soon be valued at nearly $900 million into $41.4 million.According to tax experts, claiming a 45 percent discount was questionable even back then, and far higher than the 20 to 30 percent discount the I.R.S. would allow today.The I.R.S. determined that the Trumps\u2019 assets were worth $57.1 million, 38 percent more than the couple had claimed. From the perspective of an I.R.S. auditor, pulling in nearly $5 million in additional revenue could be considered a good day\u2019s work. For the Trumps, getting the I.R.S. to agree that Fred Trump\u2019s properties were worth only $57.1 million was a triumph.\u201cAll estate matters were handled by licensed attorneys, licensed C.P.A.s and licensed real estate appraisers who followed all laws and rules strictly,\u201d Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, said in his statement.In the end, the transfer of the Trump empire cost Fred and Mary Trump $20.5 million in gift taxes and their children $21 million in annuity payments. That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than they would have paid based on the empire\u2019s market value, The Times found.On the day the Trump children finally took ownership of Fred Trump\u2019s empire, Donald Trump\u2019s net worth instantly increased by many tens of millions of dollars. And from then on, the profits from his father\u2019s empire would flow directly to him and his siblings. The next year, 1998, Donald Trump\u2019s share amounted to today\u2019s equivalent of $9.6 million, The Times found.This sudden influx of wealth came only weeks after he had published \u201cThe Art of the Comeback.\u201d\u201cI learned a lot about myself during these hard times,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI learned about handling pressure. I was able to home in, buckle down, get back to the basics, and make things work. I worked much harder, I focused, and I got myself out of a box.\u201dOver 244 pages he did not mention that he was being handed nearly 25 percent of his father\u2019s empire.During Fred Trump\u2019s final years, dementia stole most of his memories. When family visited, there was one name he could reliably put to a face.Donald.On June 7, 1999, Fred Trump was admitted to Long Island Jewish Medical Center, not far from the house in Jamaica Estates, for treatment of pneumonia. He died there on June 25, at the age of 93.Fifteen months later, Fred Trump\u2019s executors \u2014 Donald, Maryanne and Robert \u2014 filed his estate tax return. The return, obtained by The Times, vividly illustrates the effectiveness of the tax strategies devised by the Trumps in the early 1990s.Fred Trump, one of the most prolific New York developers of his time, owned just five apartment complexes, two small strip malls and a scattering of co-ops in the city upon his death. The man who paid himself $50 million in 1990 died with just $1.9 million in the bank. He owned not a single stock, bond or Treasury bill. According to his estate tax return, his most valuable asset was a $10.3 million I.O.U. from Donald Trump, money his son appears to have borrowed the year before Fred Trump died.The bulk of Fred Trump\u2019s empire was nowhere to be found on his estate tax return. And yet Donald Trump and his siblings were not done. Recycling the legally dubious techniques they had mastered with the GRATs, they dodged tens of millions of dollars in estate taxes on the remnants of empire that Fred Trump still owned when he died, The Times found.As with the GRATs, they obtained appraisals from Mr. Von Ancken that grossly understated the actual market value of those remnants. And as with the GRATs, they aggressively discounted Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s appraisals. The result: They claimed that the five apartment complexes and two strip malls were worth $15 million. In 2004, records show, bankers would put a value of $176.2 million on the exact same properties.As with the Trump Village appraisal, the Trumps appear to have hidden key facts from the I.R.S. Tysens Park, like Trump Village, had operated for years under an affordable housing program that by law capped Fred Trump\u2019s profits. This cap drastically reduced the property\u2019s market value.Except for one thing: The Trumps had removed Tysens Park from the affordable housing program the year before Fred Trump died, The Times found. When Donald Trump and his siblings filed Fred Trump\u2019s estate tax return, there were no limits on their profits. In fact, they had already begun raising rents.As their father\u2019s executors, Donald, Maryanne and Robert were legally responsible for the accuracy of his estate tax return. They were obligated not only to give the I.R.S. a complete accounting of the value of his estate\u2019s assets, but also to disclose all the taxable gifts he made during his lifetime, including, for example, the $15.5 million Trump Palace gift to Donald Trump and the millions of dollars he gave his children via All County\u2019s padded invoices.\u201cIf they knew anything was wrong they could be in violation of tax law,\u201d Mr. Tritt, the University of Florida law professor, said. \u201cThey can\u2019t just stick their heads in the sand.\u201dIn addition to drastically understating the value of apartment complexes and shopping centers, Fred Trump\u2019s estate tax return made no mention of either Trump Palace or All County.It wasn\u2019t until after Fred Trump\u2019s wife, Mary, died at 88 on Aug. 7, 2000, that the I.R.S. completed its audit of their combined estates. The audit concluded that their estates were worth $51.8 million, 23 percent more than Donald Trump and his siblings had claimed.That meant an additional $5.2 million in estate taxes. Even so, the Trumps\u2019 tax bill was a fraction of what they would have owed had they reported the market value of what Fred and Mary Trump owned at the time of their deaths.Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, defended the tax returns filed by the Trumps. \u201cThe returns and tax positions that The Times now attacks were examined in real time by the relevant taxing authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cThe taxing authorities requested a few minor adjustments, which were made, and then fully approved all of the tax filings. These matters have now been closed for more than a decade.\u201dIn 2003, the Trump siblings gathered at Trump Tower for one of their periodic updates on their inherited empire.As always, Robert Trump drove into Manhattan with several of his lieutenants. Donald Trump appeared with Allen H. Weisselberg, who had worked for Fred Trump for two decades before becoming his son\u2019s chief financial officer. The sisters, Maryanne Trump Barry and Elizabeth Trump Grau, were there as well.The meeting followed the usual routine: a financial report, a rundown of operational issues and then the real business \u2014 distributing profits to each Trump. The task of handing out the checks fell to Steve Gurien, the empire\u2019s finance chief.A moment later, Donald Trump abruptly changed the course of his family\u2019s history: He said it was a good time to sell.Fred Trump\u2019s empire, in fact, was continuing to produce healthy profits, and selling contradicted his stated wish to keep his legacy in the family. But Donald Trump insisted that the real estate market had peaked and that the time was right, according to a person familiar with the meeting.He was also, once again, in financial trouble. His Atlantic City casinos were veering toward another bankruptcy. His creditors would soon threaten to oust him unless he committed to invest $55 million of his own money.Yet if Donald Trump\u2019s sudden push to sell stunned the room, it met with no apparent resistance from his siblings. He directed his brother to solicit private bids, saying he wanted the sale handled quickly and quietly. Donald Trump\u2019s signature skill \u2014 drumming up publicity for the Trump brand \u2014 would sit this one out.Three potential bidders were given access to the finances of Fred Trump\u2019s empire \u2014 37 apartment complexes and several shopping centers. Ruby Schron, a major New York City landlord, quickly emerged as the favorite. In December 2003, Mr. Schron called Donald Trump and they came to an agreement; Mr. Schron paid $705.6 million for most of the empire, which included paying off the Trumps\u2019 mortgages. A few remaining properties were sold to other buyers, bringing the total sales price to $737.9 million.On May 4, 2004, the Trump children spent most of the day signing away ownership of what their father had doggedly built over 70 years. The sale received little news coverage, and an article in The Staten Island Advance included the rarest of phrases: \u201cTrump did not return a phone call seeking comment.\u201dEven more extraordinary was this unreported fact: The banks financing Mr. Schron\u2019s purchase valued Fred Trump\u2019s empire at nearly $1 billion. In other words, Donald Trump, master dealmaker, sold his father\u2019s empire for hundreds of millions less than it was worth.Within a year of the sale, Mr. Trump spent $149 million in cash on a rapid series of transactions that bolstered his billionaire bona fides. In June 2004 he agreed to pay $73 million to buy out his partner in the planned Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago. (\u201cI\u2019m just buying it with my own cash,\u201d he told reporters.) He paid $55 million in cash to make peace with his casino creditors. Then he put up $21 million more in cash to help finance his purchase of Maison de l\u2019Amiti\u00e9, a waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., that he later sold to a Russian oligarch.*****The first season of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was broadcast in 2004, just as Donald Trump was wrapping up the sale of his father\u2019s empire. The show\u2019s opening montage \u2014 quick cuts of a glittering Trump casino, then Trump Tower, then a Trump helicopter mid-flight, then a limousine depositing the man himself at the steps of his jet, all set to the song \u201cFor the Love of Money\u201d \u2014 is a reminder that the story of Donald Trump is fundamentally a story of money.Money is at the core of the brand Mr. Trump has so successfully sold to the world. Yet essential to that mythmaking has been keeping the truth of his money \u2014 how much of it he actually has, where and whom it came from \u2014 hidden or obscured. Across the decades, aided and abetted by less-than-aggressive journalism, Mr. Trump has made sure his financial history would be sensationalized far more than seen.In a statement to The Times, the president\u2019s spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, reiterated what Mr. Trump has always claimed about the evolution of his fortune: \u201cThe president\u2019s father gave him an initial $1 million loan, which he paid back. President Trump used this money to build an incredibly successful company as well as net worth of over $10 billion, including owning some of the world\u2019s greatest real estate.\u201dBut the more than 100,000 pages of records obtained during this investigation make it possible to sweep away decades of misinformation and arrive at a clear understanding about the original source of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth \u2014 his father.Here is what can be said with certainty: Had Mr. Trump done nothing but invest the money his father gave him in an index fund that tracks the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, he would be worth $1.96 billion today. As for that $1 million loan, Fred Trump actually lent him at least $60.7 million, or $140 million in today\u2019s dollars, The Times found.And there is one more Fred Trump windfall coming Donald Trump\u2019s way. Starrett City, the Brooklyn housing complex that the Trumps invested in back in the 1970s, sold this year for $905 million. Donald Trump\u2019s share of the proceeds is expected to exceed $16 million, records show.It was an investment made with Fred Trump\u2019s money and connections. But in Donald Trump\u2019s version of his life, Starrett City is always and forever \u201cone of the best investments I ever made.\u201dPhoto illustration by Grant Gold/The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Indonesia Plane Crash Adds to Country\u2019s Troubling Safety Record", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJAKARTA, Indonesia \u2014 A jetliner carrying 189 people from Jakarta crashed into the Java Sea on Monday, renewing concerns about air safety in a vast island nation dependent on air travel and raising questions about how a brand-new plane fell from the sky.Minutes after takeoff, with the skies clear, the crew of Lion Air Flight 610 contacted air traffic controllers and asked permission to return to the airport.\u201cThe request was permitted,\u201d said a spokesman for the Indonesian air navigation authorities, Yohanes Sirait. \u201cThen we lost contact. It was very quick, maybe around one minute.\u201dWitnesses who saw the plane hurtle into Karawang Bay, northeast of Jakarta, told the authorities they had not heard an explosion. Officials appeared to have given up any hope of survivors.\u201cI suspect all the passengers are dead,\u201d said Marine Brig. Gen. Bambang Suryo, director of operations for the search and rescue agency.By airplane standards, the Boeing 737 Max 8 that crashed was brand new. It was delivered to Lion Air in August and had flown only about 800 total hours before it went down.\u201cThe Max 8 was one of the Boeing\u2019s fastest-selling entry airplanes,\u201d said Robert W. Mann, an airline consultant based in Port Washington, N.Y. \u201cThere are thousands of them on order.\u201dA new class of aircraft, the plane entered service only about 17 months ago but has quickly become an airline mainstay as carriers like Southwest and American Airlines add them to their fleets. They generally replace older 737s, which fly mostly domestic routes.The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed the crash was the first fatal accident involving any type of Boeing 737 Max.Edward Sirait, Lion Air\u2019s president director, said the plane that crashed on Monday had experienced an unspecified technical problem during a flight the day before from the Indonesian resort island of Bali to Jakarta. He said the issue had been resolved \u201caccording to procedure.\u201dIn the hours after the crash Monday, a team of 30 divers was searching for the plane\u2019s black boxes, critical pieces of evidence for determining the cause of the crash, Air Marshal Muhammad Syaugi, chief of the search and rescue agency, said. Officials said rescue workers had arrived at the crash site, two nautical miles south of the aircraft\u2019s last reported coordinates.The plane departed Jakarta, the capital, at 6:21 a.m. Monday. The aviation website Flight Tracker said the flight had been scheduled to arrive at 7:20 a.m. in Pangkal Pinang, on an island off Sumatra.The 178 passengers included two infants, one other child, and about 20 officials from the country\u2019s Ministry of Finance and 10 more from the state auditor agency, officials said. An Indian pilot was among the eight crew members, and an Italian passenger was also onboard.By Monday night, the authorities said that human remains recovered from the crash site had been placed in nine body bags, but it was unclear from how many victims the remains came from. Mr. Syaugi said he believed that many of the bodies were still trapped in the plane.Agus Haryono, an operations official with Indonesia\u2019s National Search and Rescue Agency, told reporters that police and military rescue divers had found part of what they believed was the fuselage and were searching for more at a depth of around 130 feet, as well as on the water\u2019s surface.\u201cWe have found pieces of fuselage and passengers\u2019 property, such as I.D. cards,\u201d Mr. Agus said. \u201cThere is a lot of debris.\u201dDanang Mandala Prihantoro, a Lion Air official, said in a statement that the aircraft had been in service only since August. \u201cLion Air is very concerned about this incident and will collaborate with relevant agencies and all parties,\u201d Mr. Danang said. The airline, he said, had set up hotlines for the relatives of passengers to call for information.The cause of the crash was not clear.FlightRadar24, a flight tracking service, said that it had analyzed preliminary satellite navigation data from the flight that showed an \u201cincrease in speed\u201d and \u201chigh rate of descent\u201d from the plane\u2019s last transmission.The data released by FlightRadar24 showed Monday\u2019s flight taking off and initially ascending to what would be a normal altitude. But within a couple of minutes, the plane suddenly plunged 500 feet and banked left in an unusual flight pattern. The plane then ascended and leveled off before what appears to have been a sharp descent into the Java Sea.\u201cThe erratic flight path makes us suspect a problem with the pitot-static system,\u201d said Gerry Soejatman, an Indonesian aviation expert, referring to the instruments used to record the flight\u2019s airborne speed and altitude.Mr. Soejatman said he had looked at the flight data from Sunday\u2019s flight and noted a \u201csimilar erratic climb and groundspeed problem,\u201d leading him to suspect a problem with the instruments had also been an issue then.Several plane crashes have been blamed on blockages or other problems with pitot tubes, a probe on the outside of the aircraft, which resulted in erroneous speed or altitude readings, Mr. Soejatman said.Conchita Caroline, a television presenter who was on Sunday\u2019s flight from Bali to Jakarta, said the beginning of the journey was marred by irregularities. As the plane readied for takeoff, the engine seemed to die several times, she said.For about half an hour, the passengers were kept on the plane at the Bali airport with no explanation, even as a lack of electricity made the interior hot and stuffy, she said, causing children to cry and some older passengers to vomit.\u201cThe passengers were all confused,\u201d Ms. Caroline said. \u201cWe had no idea what was going on.\u201dThe plane eventually took off, but Ms. Caroline said that the air conditioner did not work well during the flight and that the floor under her feet felt hot to the touch. The right engine, which she could see from her window, was shaking, she said.\u201cI don\u2019t really understand about airplane engines,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I have never experienced this kind of thing before.\u201dSoerjanto Thanjono, the chief of Indonesia\u2019s National Transportation Safety Committee, said at a news briefing on Monday that the weather had been sunny and clear.After the plane took off, the wind speed was only five knots between the altitudes of 10,000 and 24,000 feet, said Dwikorita Karnawati, the head of the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics.Lion Air said in a statement on Monday that the captain of the flight, Capt. Bhavye Suneja, an Indian citizen, had more than 6,000 flying hours and that the co-pilot, who goes by the single name of Harvino, had more than 5,000 flying hours.Air travel is an especially convenient way to move around Indonesia, an archipelago nation of more than 13,000 islands and the world\u2019s fourth most populous.Monday\u2019s crash was the latest of at least 15 episodes involving Lion Air since it began operations in 2000.

{"Headline": "France Ties Iran to Bomb Plot, and Freezes Spy Agency Assets", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 France publicly linked Iran\u2019s intelligence services to a foiled bomb plot that targeted a June meeting near Paris of an Iranian opposition group, and announced that it would freeze the assets of the Iranian spy ministry.A plot of \u201csuch extreme seriousness on French territory could not be let go without a response,\u201d France\u2019s ministers of foreign affairs, interior and finance said in a joint statement on Tuesday.\u201cFrance has taken preventive, proportionate and targeted measures,\u201d the ministers said. \u201cIn taking this decision France reiterates its determination to fight terrorism, especially on its own territory.\u201dThe decision was particularly notable because it suggested that France, unlike the United States, believes that it is possible to punish Iran for hostile actions at the same time that it tries to preserve the Iran nuclear deal, which allowed the lifting of sanctions jointly applied by the European Union and the United States.President Trump pulled out of the nuclear accord this year, pronouncing the Iranian government a rogue actor and the 2015 deal as wholly insufficient to rein in its ambitions, as well as doing nothing to halt its meddling and support of regional conflicts. In contrast, European countries are trying to find a way to avoid pulling out of the deal because they think doing so will worsen Iran\u2019s relationship with the West.At the same time, the decision to freeze the assets of the spy ministry seemed to be a clear sign France was angry that Iran appeared to be ignoring international norms and acting with impunity. It also indicated that, at least indirectly, France endorsed Mr. Trump\u2019s judgment that Iran was a rogue regime.An Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, Bahram Qasemi, denied that Iran had been involved in a bombing plot, the state news agency IRNA reported.The assets of two of the Iranians believed to have been behind the plot have also been frozen, the French ministers said. One is a former Iranian diplomat in Vienna, Assadollah Asadi; the background of the other, Saeid Hashemi Moghadam, was not specified. But French news media reported that he was a senior official at the Iranian Intelligence and Security Ministry.They were found with a homemade explosive, TATP, in their car, the authorities said. Mr. Asadi was arrested by the German police, and a fourth man was detained in Paris. The sanctions announced on Tuesday did not appear to be aimed at either member of the couple or at the man arrested in France.The foiled plot was supposed to take place on June 30 in Villepinte, a city outside Paris, where the National Council of Resistance of Iran, a Paris-based group that is dominated by the Mujahedeen el Khalq, or M.E.K., had organized a rally to promote itself as a future alternative to the Iranian government. There were 25,000 people at the event.The M.E.K. was founded in Iran as a dissident group; it supported the overthrow of the shah and then opposed the clerical leadership led by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that took the shah\u2019s place. It allied itself with Saddam Hussein and for many years had a base in Iraq, where it increasingly came to be viewed as marginal and akin to a cult.Most of its members are Iranian exiles living abroad, principally in Europe and the United States. It was designated as a terrorist organization by the State Department from 1997 to 2012.At the June rally, two close allies of Mr. Trump were present: Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of his lawyers, and Newt Gingrich, a conservative Republican politician and former speaker of the House.Advertisement"}

(See: tape, Access Hollywood.)Strategists from both sides say the gender gap shows that Mr. Trump\u2019s denigration of women \u2014 including those he allegedly had affairs with \u2014 is undoing years of work by the Republican Party to court female voters.That dynamic makes things complicated for Republicans, particularly those running in the kind of suburban seats that could determine control of the House.Jay Webber, a Republican who\u2019s running in suburban New Jersey, told me a few weeks ago that it was impossible to ignore the president \u2014 no matter how hard he tried. \u201cHe\u2019s a major public figure.

The gap in small donors accounts for about 40 percent of the Democrats\u2019 overall financial advantage.\u201cWe have been building toward this,\u201d said Mr. Mele, a former political strategist who built online outreach campaigns. \u201cI think when we look back, we will not see this year as an outlier.\u201dThe flood of online donations on the Democratic side has reshaped the campaign for control of the House, diminishing the financial might Republicans expected to wield in the closing rounds of battle to keep their majority. Republicans have long enjoyed stronger support than Democrats among wealthy individual donors and much of the business community, and the party can still rely on a network of lavishly funded super PACs to blanket many districts with advertising in the coming weeks.But the influx of Democratic donations touched every corner of the House map, from high-profile races in the suburbs of New York and California, to more rural, conservative-leaning stretches of Indiana, Kansas and Alaska.Mr. Janz, who appears to have raised more from donors than any other Democratic congressional candidate in the last quarter, despite receiving little help from the national party, said he had benefited from Mr. Nunes being \u201cglobally disliked among progressives.\u201d\u201cWe put together, I think, a credible national message that revolves around ending the corruption in Washington,\u201d Mr. Janz said in an interview. \u201cAnd Nunes is at the heart of all of that.\u201dMs. McGrath raised $3.6 million in the last three months and Ms. Davids raised $2.7 million.

The principal Republican group focused on defending the House, the Congressional Leadership Fund, has raised and spent a titanic sum this cycle, collecting about $126 million and ending last month with $36 million left to spend.Still, in recent days, Republican strategists have warned of a \u201cgreen wave\u201d approaching from the left \u2013 a tide of Democratic money pouring in online to dislodge entrenched lawmakers. That money, delivered directly to candidates, gives Democrats in the hardest-fought races a better chance to hold their own against a barrage of Republican advertising.Corry Bliss, who heads the Congressional Leadership Fund, warned donors in a memo last week that Democratic candidates were overwhelming some Republican candidates with advertising.\u201cDemocratic candidates are outspending Republican candidates in key races by $50 million,\u201d Mr. Bliss wrote, invoking the \u201cgreen wave\u201d metaphor and noting that Democrats had billionaire backers, too, including Michael R.

(Among his other choices were Stanley Kramer\u2019s \u201cShip of Fools\u201d and Sidney Lumet\u2019s \u201cThe Pawnbroker.\u201d)At first, Mr. Landau suggested a modest 10-minute tribute to Dr. King. But they agreed on a far more ambitious venture, told through extensive footage of marches, rallies, church services and Dr. King\u2019s speeches.The film included readings by entertainers, including James Earl Jones, Harry Belafonte and Joanne Woodward, a feature that Mr. Landau had wanted.\u201cIt\u2019s a way of getting audiences, which is what Ely was concerned about,\u201d Mr. Kaplan told Mr. Schartoff. \u201cAt first I was opposed. It would break the continuity and the tension we were building up.\u201d But he changed his mind and came to believe that these segments complemented the rest of the film.Richard James Kaplan was born in Manhattan on Jan. 3, 1925, and moved with his family to the Rockaways, in Queens. His father, Benjamin, was a lawyer until the Depression hurt his practice and he took a Civil Service job. His mother, Natalie (Blaustein) Kaplan, was a teacher and social worker.Mr. Kaplan entered Antioch College in Ohio when he was 16 and studied English and political science there. Before he could earn his bachelor\u2019s degree, he was drafted into the Army during World War II, fighting in the Battle of the Bulge with the 99th Infantry Division. He graduated from Antioch after his discharge and studied film at the University of Southern California.In the 1950s he worked on various film projects, including one about combat leadership in the Air Force for a psychological research organization.The Roosevelt and King films were the start of a productive period in which he made documentaries about the actress Liv Ullmann; the American journalist Varian Fry, who led a covert rescue operation in France during World War II that saved more than 2,000 artists, writers, philosophers and their families; and one about some of those exiles, who had emigrated to the United States.He added, \u201cHe made films out of passion, and they were not negative; they were sometimes about the triumph of the human spirit, particularly when he was dealing with extraordinary women like Eleanor and Liv Ullmann.\u201dIn addition to his daughter Eve, Mr. Kaplan is survived by another daughter, Erica Kaplan; a stepdaughter, Kirsti Tidemand-Johannesen; a stepson, Kjeld Tidemand-Johannesen; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

{"Headline": "Ballot Applications in Georgia, and Senate and House Latest: 12 Days to Go", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Tip SheetWelcome to The Tip Sheet, a daily political analysis of the 2018 elections, based on interviews with Republican and Democratic officials, pollsters, strategists and voters.Fears of voter suppression were again ignited in Georgia on Thursday after state Democratic officials said that more than 4,700 vote-by-mail applications were missing in DeKalb County, one of Georgia\u2019s most populous and liberal-leaning regions.County officials acknowledged the missing applications in a phone conversation this week with Democratic voter protection officials, and pledged to call the thousands of voters to inform them of the error, according to multiple people familiar with the conversation.A spokesman for the DeKalb County elections board would not confirm the details of the call. Sam Tillman, the chairman of the board, added that \u201cthere is no evidence that there are any missing or lost absentee ballot request forms.\u201d He said of a list of 4,700 names provided by the Democratic officials, he could confirm that the county had only received 48 of the requests.Seth Bringman, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Georgia, called the episode an example of voter suppression under Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp. Mr. Kemp, to some controversy, is holding dual roles as the state\u2019s election official and the Republican nominee for governor.\u201cOur message to voters is this: If you requested a vote-by-mail ballot from your county and your county did not send you a ballot, go in-person if you are able to an early voting site,\u201d Mr. Bringman said. \u201cWe will not allow Brian Kemp\u2019s voter suppression or mistakes by election officials to take away your right to vote.\u201dEarlier this week, Mr. Kemp refused to respond to criticism that he was creating electoral barriers for Democratic voters to help his gubernatorial aspirations. In a statement, he blamed the allegations of voter suppression on \u201cSan Francisco socialists and liberal billionaires from New York.\u201d\u2022 Red-state Senate Democrats have found a villain for their closing message: those dastardly Democrats.Two of the most vulnerable incumbents, Claire McCaskill of Missouri and Joe Donnelly of Indiana, have moved aggressively in recent ads to distance themselves from left-wing elements in their own party.Mr. Donnelly, leaving nothing to chance, leaned on a visual aid. Brandishing an ax in his ad, he ticks off his less-than-progressive record \u2014 a split with many in his party on the Bush tax cuts, a split with the \u201cliberal left\u201d over defense spending \u2014 while literally splitting hunks of wood in half. It\u2019s a metaphor, ya see. \u201cI split with my own party,\u201d he says, thwacking away, \u201cto support funding for Trump\u2019s border wall.\u201d\u2022 Want to know how Republicans are feeling about the Senate campaign? Watch Air Force One.But senior party officials indicate he may have time for a second trip to one of those states. And that will be the tell: Where might Mr. Trump head back to for a final pre-election rally?\u2022 Mi Familia Vota, a Latino civic organization, is releasing an arresting television ad featuring a dramatization of President Trump slapping Latinos across the face. The ad is titled \u201cTrumpadas,\u201d a play on the Spanish word \u201ctrompada,\u201d which is a punch.Rare is the debate in which a racial slur is spelled onstage.But such is the Florida governor\u2019s race right now.Mr. DeSantis was not pleased with the question.\u201cHow the hell am I supposed to know every single statement somebody makes?\u201d he asked, pledging not to \u201cbow down to the altar of political correctness.\u201dHis Democratic opponent, Andew Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee and an African-American, smiled a bit.The moment, fascinating on its own, also spoke to a larger dynamic this year: racial politics being discussed explicitly \u2014 no tiptoeing \u2014 in prominent races featuring black contenders. The night before in Georgia, Stacey Abrams, the Democratic nominee for governor, suggested that her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp, had created \u201can atmosphere of fear\u201d by restricting voting access in communities of color as secretary of state.How much did campaigns, party committees and super PACs raise during the first two and a half weeks of this month? That will become clear Thursday, when they file reports with the Federal Election Commission before a midnight deadline.What to watch for:Senator Robert Menendez, the Democrat of New Jersey in a tight race for re-election after a trial on federal corruption charges ended in a hung jury, found his character on the line in his debate Wednesday night against Bob Hugin, the Republican candidate and former pharmaceutical executive.At issue was a recent Hugin ad focusing on the most explosive of the sundry allegations against Mr. Menendez: that he and a friend hired underage prostitutes while vacationing in the Dominican Republic. This has never been proven \u2014 it came from an anonymous tipster \u2014 and was not included in an indictment brought against the men.\u201cIt\u2019s a lie, Bob,\u201d Mr. Menendez said firmly. \u201cYou know it\u2019s a lie.\u201dMr. Hugin said he was \u201cnot saying we should retry Mr. Menendez\u201d but added that questions of character remained fair game.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.In other moments, the two were reasonably courteous, at least by the standards of a generally vicious campaign. And the contours of the race were clear:\u2022 Mr. Menendez, holding an unexpectedly narrow lead in some polls, said he understood the feelings of those who were \u201cdisappointed\u201d in him, but asked them to consider the \u201ctotality of service.\u201d\u2022 Mr. Hugin, a backer of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, strained to shed the label of \u201cTrump Republican.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m an independent Republican.\u201dLook for this story soon from our colleague Maggie Astor:Lisa Lerer and Kenneth P.

One of the things we have learned about our president over the last few years is that he never recognizes a bad plan.Do you think it\u2019s all a plot? Maybe whenever the White House desperately needs to distract the public from a new presidential mess, somebody says, \u201cHey, can you get the Big Guy to call somebody a dog?\u201dBut there is a horse connection. Back in the \u201980s, Trump acquired a 2-year-old racer named Alibi, which he cruelly renamed D.J. Trump.According to a former Trump casino official, the future president demanded that the colt be worked out despite the trainer\u2019s concerns that he might be sick. The trainer was right, the horse had to have part of his hooves amputated, and then Trump announced he was not going to pay for a defective horse. So Alibi/D.J. hobbled off into history.Pop quiz: Suppose you were a president trying to get past an embarrassing story about sex with a porn star named Stormy, and you finally get one tiny win in what will undoubtedly be litigation that runs longer than \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d Would you:A) Pretend nothing is happening and confine all your public comments to that exciting new plan for across-the-board budget cuts.B) Take your wife on a vacation in which you will actually be seen spending time together.C) Launch a tweet vowing to \u201cgo after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer.\u201dWell, yeah, C.\u201cHe should not have said that,\u201d the soon-to-retire House Speaker Paul Ryan remarked during a morning news interview. The look on Ryan\u2019s face was somber, but somewhere in the back of his eyes you could see him setting off fireworks and yelling, \u201cI\u2019m out of here, suckers!\u201dIt was definitely an improvement over Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana\u2019s defensive: \u201cWe\u2019ve all done something like that before.\u201d To which Kennedy unhelpfully added that he believes the president \u201cgrows anxious when he has unexpressed thoughts.\u201dRepublicans who are trying to get elected in a year when women are the party\u2019s big problem were obviously not thrilled when the president reminded everyone of his animal-name-calling habit. Trump lost the women\u2019s vote in the last election, although he did win a narrow majority of white women. That was nearly two years and a lot of insults ago. We\u2019ll have to see how many of them have noticed that he reminds them of that kid in grade school who used to call girls \u201cFatso\u201d or \u201cBowlegs.\u201dNaturally there was a Stormy response. (\u201cIn addition to his \u2026 umm \u2026 shortcomings, he has demonstrated his incompetence, hatred of women and lack of self control on Twitter AGAIN! And perhaps a penchant for bestiality. Game on, Tiny.\u201d)I believe I speak for all of America when I say that having Donald Trump as president is bad enough without having to think about his genitals.

California would seem to be on the ballot in a number of states where Republicans are facing tough re-election battles this fall.

The state figures in laugh lines and attack lines wielded by candidates for the House and Senate, for governor and for state legislative seats.California has been a favorite object for political mockery since the days of the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley and Flower Power in Haight-Ashbury.

But since the death of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (or as it was called in Republican circles, \u201cTaxachusetts\u201d) is no longer as inviting a target as it once was. Republicans also have a harder time pointing to New York as a symbol of liberal excess when its most prominent resident now occupies the White House.With immigration looming as a key issue in this election cycle, California, where Latinos make up 40 percent of the population, would seem the right state for these times.As a result, the state seems to be joining Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader (who is from San Francisco) as a go-to motivator for Republican candidates looking for red-meat appeals to fire up supporters.\u201cEvery crazy thing, public policy-wise, that comes out of California is just anathema to entrepreneurs and average voters,\u201d said David M. Carney, a political consultant advising Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican running for re-election. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the aggressiveness of the craziness of California regulating every aspect of everyone\u2019s life that makes it a good example of what we don\u2019t want to be.\u201dMr. Abbott routinely begins his political speeches by pledging to build a wall \u2014 between Texas and New Mexico, \u201cso we can keep all the Californians out.\u201dThe Republican Governors Association issued a news release with this warning about the governor\u2019s race in Florida: \u201cDemocrat Andrew Gillum Wants Floridians To Pay California-Level Taxes.\u201d His Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis, picked up the theme as he campaigned in Sarasota.\u201cCalifornia is absolutely not the model for Florida,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a historic mistake to go down the road of being a high-tax, high-spending state.\u201dCalifornians scoff at the attacks as reflecting envy of their state\u2019s soaring coastlines and bright-blue skies, where Americans have been streaming for almost 200 years.\u201cThis is another sorry example of the current state of Republican solipsism,\u201d said Jerry Brown, the Democratic governor. \u201cThe irony is that when they attack California, they attack the very engine of America\u2019s prosperity and leadership.\u201dTom Steyer, a billionaire environmentalist from San Francisco, whose organization has financed campaigns against Republicans in 11 states, including Florida and Nevada, said the attacks were a cynical political tactic aimed at diverting voters\u2019 attention from issues Republicans do not want to talk about, like health care.\u201cDo I think California is perfect?\u201d Mr. Steyer said. \u201cHell, no. But do I think we have a functioning democracy that is trying to deal with these issues? I think we do.\u201dIn some ways, California makes itself an easy target, with laws regulating plastic bags and, this year, plastic straws \u2014 the kind of restrictions that would seem particular anathema to voters in states like Nevada, Colorado and Texas with deep Western skepticism about big government. But it\u2019s not only the smaller issues: California has come to represent a vision of government \u2014 expansive and expensive \u2014 than is not nearly as welcome in swing states like Nevada.\u201cThe Californians come here, and they want to change things around,\u201d said Patrick Casale, 57, a health insurance broker and Republican who lives in Las Vegas. \u201cThey want us to pay more taxes. They want to make Nevada a sanctuary state. They want to impose their way of life on us.\u201dThere is wariness not only of California, analysts from both parties say, but also of the ethnic diversity that California has come to represent. \u201cThere is a little bit of coded language there \u2014 about \u2018the other,\u2019\u201d said David Damore, a professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\u201cThey don\u2019t have much to campaign on substantively,\u201d Mr. Damore said of Republican candidates generally. \u201cThey are not campaigning on the tax cuts. The Affordable Care Act blew up in their face. So they are trying to draw support from the idea that our way of life is under attack.\u201dIn the Colorado race for governor, the Republican Governors Association weighed in early with an advertisement titled \u201cRadiCalifornia.\u201d It was directed at the Democrat in the race, Representative Jared Polis, who is running against Walker Stapleton, the Republican state treasurer.\u201cJared Polis wants to turn Colorado into RadiCalifornia,\u201d the announcer said. \u201cPolis wants higher taxes. Polis wants to put tens of thousands of energy jobs at risk. And you can forget fixing our traffic problems.\u201dBut David Flaherty, a Republican pollster in Colorado, said he believed that advertisement had fallen flat.\u201cAre Californians moving here and changing our state, which is arguably what happened in Nevada?\u201d Mr. Flaherty asked. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that is a prevailing thought in voters\u2019 minds. We are not there yet.\u201dWilliam McCurdy II, the Democratic leader in Nevada, said he had become inured to the invocations of California by Mr. Heller and Mr. Laxalt, who is the state attorney general, and doubted they would make much difference.\u201cWhat they are doing is looking at another state and fear-mongering,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t resonate with a majority of Nevadans, who care about issues like health care and economy.\u201dStill, candidates and strategists say Republicans are tapping into a genuine concern with this line of attack.Jeff Hays, the Republican leader in Colorado, said he has seen rising resentment among some Coloradans over an influx of Californians.\u201cWe don\u2019t want the housing costs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the traffic problems. We don\u2019t want the taxes. There\u2019s a fear of urbanization, because that\u2019s where you get a lot of the problems \u2014 the crime, the congestion, the overregulation.\u201d\u201cAnd the plastic straw ban,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you serious?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Liberal San Francisco, Tech Leaders Brawl Over Tax Proposal to Aid Homeless", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJack Dorsey, chief executive of Twitter and Square, is among the technology executives who have been fiercely opposed to a Nov. 6 ballot measure that would impose a new tax on companies.For months, technology companies in San Francisco have fought a local ballot proposition that would impose taxes on corporations to fund initiatives to help the homeless.But last week, that unified front crumbled when Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, the online software company that is the city\u2019s largest private employer, broke from the pack. \u201cHomelessness is all of our responsibility,\u201d he tweeted. Then the billionaire committed $2 million to passing the tax measure and criticized his fellow tech moguls for not caring.The vitriol among tech executives over the proposition has become \u201cawkward,\u201d said Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator who represents San Francisco and surrounding areas and who is against the tax. Still, he praised the companies for becoming more involved in local politics.The dispute over Proposition C raises the question of what responsibilities tech companies have for problems in their own backyards. Tech firms often receive blame for exacerbating inequality and driving up property values with their hefty employee pay packages, contributing to homelessness. The question of what these companies may owe their hometowns is magnified because many of them have taken advantage of local tax breaks to spur their own growth.\u201cI\u2019m down to help in any way I can, as long as the mayor has the accountability,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said in an interview. He added that he was not worried about being perceived as opposing support for the homeless, \u201cbecause it feels like the right thing to do to get into the nuance and bring out more of the concerns.\u201dThose in favor of the new tax argue that they are not asking tech companies to come up with a strategy to save the homeless. Instead, they said, they simply want to raise taxes on the firms to fund resources. The extra money from the proposition could total $300 million a year and would effectively double the city\u2019s budget for addressing homelessness.\u201cYou\u2019re either for the homeless or you\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Benioff said in an interview. \u201cEveryone is willing to say it\u2019s a terrible problem and it\u2019s getting worse, but only so many are willing to write a check to make it better.\u201dSam Lew, policy director of the Coalition on Homelessness, said the proposition was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d because the funding would provide housing.The measure qualified for the city ballot in July. Polling conducted by the opposition campaign in early September indicated that 56 percent of likely voters favored the tax, but that number decreased to 47 percent when they received opposition messaging.In August, an executive at Dolby Laboratories, which makes entertainment systems, sent an email to more than 30 technology companies in San Francisco about the measure, asking if they planned to take a stand on it. Other companies on the email included Salesforce, Stripe, Twitter, GitHub, Uber, Lyft, Zendesk, Slack and Yelp.Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, who favors the measure, said in an interview: \u201cYou are either for the homeless or you\u2019re not.\u201dExecutives at Salesforce and Stripe said they would most likely oppose the measure, according to the emails, which were obtained by The New York Times.In one email, Darryl Yee, Salesforce\u2019s tax chief, said: \u201cI grew up in SF and very much want to address the homeless problem, but the city\u2019s budget already seems pretty healthy, especially when you consider we\u2019re only a population of 800K.\u201dMichael Yip, Stripe\u2019s head of tax, wrote back that tech companies might make sizable charitable donations to homelessness causes instead, \u201cin hopes that this will be enough to sway the Mayor to publicly oppose this.\u201dTwitter and Zendesk declined to comment. GitHub and Lyft did not return requests for comment. Yelp said it was \u201cnot active\u201d on the issue.Patrick Collison, Stripe\u2019s chief executive, later tweeted that the measure was \u201cpoor policy.\u201dIn a statement on Friday, Stripe said that homelessness was complex and that \u201csolutions require careful interventions.\u201d It added, \u201cAnyone who claims that Prop C is a matter of being \u2018for the homeless or against them\u2019 is selling a facile falsehood.\u201dMr. Benioff said early conversations within Salesforce focused on opposing the tax since \u201call companies are supposed to oppose all taxes. You kind of learn that in business school.\u201d But he changed his mind after talking with his co-chief executive, Keith Block, who often encountered homeless people on his walks to work.\u201cWe said, you know what, I think we have to support this,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. He added that homelessness \u2014 not taxes \u2014 had become an existential threat to business in the city and that Salesforce might have to leave if the crisis continued.On Oct. 8, Mr. Benioff announced his $2 million commitment to passing the measure and tweeted his support for the tax.In response, Mr. Dorsey tweeted his opposition. Mr. Benioff then questioned Mr. Dorsey\u2019s philanthropy; Mr. Dorsey insisted that Mr. Benioff reread his arguments.Mr. Dorsey now plans to give $75,000 to the campaign against the tax, a Square spokesman said. The funding would help spread a more nuanced message about the ballot initiative, Mr. Dorsey said.Stripe has also recently donated an additional $400,000 to the campaign against the tax, according to public records. Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital, gave $100,000, according to public records. In an email, Mr. Moritz said he agreed with Stripe\u2019s stance on the measure and noted that his foundation had recently given $11 million to Hamilton Families, an organization fighting homelessness.Cisco\u2019s chief executive, Chuck Robbins, spoke in support of Mr. Benioff in a statement this week, saying, \u201cWe must end the homelessness and housing crises our communities are facing.\u201d He said he was supporting a proposition to fund affordable housing in San Jose, Calif., where Cisco has its headquarters.In a phone call after their Twitter exchange, Mr. Benioff said, Mr. Dorsey told him that the tax in Proposition C was too high. Mr. Dorsey said he had merely pointed out the disproportionate impact that the tax would have on payment processors like Square. Mr. Benioff estimated Salesforce would pay $10 million annually for the tax; Mr. Dorsey said Square, a much smaller company, would pay $20 million.Mr. Benioff has since continued taking digs at other San Francisco tech leaders and their stance on Proposition C. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know they didn\u2019t like it until they realized I supported it,\u201d he said.Mr. Dorsey, when asked if he agreed with Mr. Benioff\u2019s characterization of their conversation, responded with a single word: \u201cNo.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Faces a Challenger in the Home Solar Business", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Just four years after its founding in 2006, SolarCity had emerged as the nation\u2019s leading rooftop solar power company. The company\u2019s founders, with the help of their billionaire cousin, Elon Musk, set out to be the vanguard of an age in which consumers weaned themselves from dependence on utilities for their electricity.In the short term, the biggest competition is coming from Sunrun, an installer of residential solar panels and energy storage that is capturing a growing amount of what had been SolarCity\u2019s signature market.\u201cIt is all but guaranteed that Sunrun will emerge as the top residential solar installer in the U.S.,\u201d said Allison Mond, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, which provides consulting on various issues including energy and renewables. \u201cTesla\u2019s residential solar business is in rapid decline as the company has cut many sales channels.\u201dWood Mackenzie, which tracks and supplies solar data for the Solar Energy Industries Association, says Tesla accounts for 9.3 percent of residential solar installations nationwide this year, followed by Sunrun at 9.0 percent, in a fragmented industry. In 2015, SolarCity had one-third of the market while Sunrun had 5 percent.Since the acquisition of SolarCity, Tesla has worked to present itself as a one-stop shop for a homeowner\u2019s needs \u2014 an electric car in the garage, solar panels on the roof, and a battery called the Powerwall storing energy to help power both the car and the home. Tesla also makes a battery system it sells commercially and to utilities, called the Powerpack. The Powerpack stores energy from the electric grid as well as power collected from solar arrays larger than systems designed for home use.In the third quarter, the company\u2019s noncar battery business, as measured in megawatts, more than doubled from the same quarter a year earlier. But its solar installations, also measured in megawatts, have declined sharply. To match last year\u2019s installations, Tesla would have to sell twice as much in the fourth quarter as it did in the first three quarters combined.Sunrun says it has already surpassed Tesla, if the installations it finances through third-party contractors are counted. That could bring Sunrun\u2019s market share for residential installations to as much as 15 percent.Sunrun, founded in 2007 and based in San Francisco, says it has sold more than $3 billion in installed solar systems. Lynn Jurich, Sunrun\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, said her company recently expanded into seven new markets and now has a presence in 22 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.Part of Sunrun\u2019s strategy has been to stay focused on financing and installing solar panels and batteries rather than producing those products itself.Ms. Jurich said, \u201cManufacturing, that\u2019s not our core competency.\u201dNew opportunities for both companies are opening up, especially in California, which is already the nation\u2019s leader in solar installations and is adding new mandates and incentives.Analysts say prices for comparable residential solar systems at Sunrun and Tesla are about the same. But as they move to take advantage of the growing appeal of home solar power, the companies are pursuing divergent paths.Visitors to Tesla\u2019s showroom in Burbank, Calif., will find a Model X and Model S parked on the showroom floor while a Powerwall and a single solar panel are displayed on a wall. A video shows how the products can be integrated.The approach of using Tesla stores replaced a long-established sales strategy that focused on a partnership with Home Depot in which Tesla representatives sold solar panels at the hardware giant\u2019s retail outlets. Tesla says selling its products under one roof \u201cwill save money and enable our colleagues to work together more effectively and efficiently.\u201dBut the partnership approach seems to suit Sunrun, which lacks its own showrooms and has struck a relationship with another giant retailer, Costco.That\u2019s where Ed Hanlon, of Carlsbad, Calif., recently encountered a Sunrun sales representative. After researching the company, Mr. Hanlon, 72, decided to buy a 7.5-kilowatt solar power system, including a battery, that workers began installing this month.\u201cWe live in California, so sunshine is a given,\u201d said Mr. Hanlon, a retired Marine. But what pushed him to go solar was frustration with the rate increases by his power company, San Diego Gas and Electric, over the last couple of years.\u201cI thought: \u2018O.K., what can we do to kind of dampen that down?\u2019\u201d Mr. Hanlon said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a feel-good part of it.\u201dNeither Sunrun nor Tesla makes its own solar panels. Tesla has a deal with Panasonic to make panels at Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo but uses other suppliers as well. Tesla manufactures all of its other products, including parts for installing the systems.The foreign origin of many panels has been a handicap for the industry since President Trump imposed tariffs on their import this year. Sunrun says that the tariffs have not slowed its business, while Tesla declined to comment about the impact.Sunrun\u2019s revenue in 2017 was $533 million, up from $477 million in 2016. Tesla\u2019s revenue from electricity generation and storage last year was $1.1 billion, but that includes some commercial and utility-scale products.Even with the traction that Sunrun has gotten, Tesla says it is intent on pushing ideas that are untested or have yet to gain widespread adoption or success.And it is building out its leadership team with the recent arrival of Sanjay Shah, who helped with growth and development at Dell and Amazon, as the senior vice president of Tesla Energy.\u201cCompetition is always healthy,\u201d Mr. Shah said in an interview, but he said Tesla and Sunrun were fundamentally different.\u201cInstead of focusing on the competition and the markets, we are focusing on where the world is going,\u201d he said. \u201cThe growth in terms of market share is just a matter of time. Our energy business will continue to grow, and it will be as big as our auto business.\u201dBut Vikram Aggarwal, the co-founder and chief executive of EnergySage, a solar comparison-shopping service, said Tesla\u2019s self-contained approach had made it challenging for Mr. Musk to execute his vision.\u201cThey wanted to be a fully vertically integrated product, manufacturing and installation company,\u201d Mr. Aggarwal said. \u201cThat is a very, very expensive strategy to implement where you have so many components. For one company to be really good at all of it is very difficult.\u201dMr. Shah described the changes as strategic moves to improve efficiency. Customers, he said, will ultimately visit and keep returning to Tesla stores because of the experience they will find in search of products to power their lives. \u201cWhen customers think renewable energy, they should think about electric vehicles, solar and battery \u2014 not just solar and a battery,\u201d he said.While Tesla announced a 9 percent job reduction across all its businesses in June, it has been hiring more installers and electricians to ramp up its solar power and energy storage business.The crown jewel of Tesla\u2019s solar products was supposed to be glass solar shingles that would be more visually appealing than the rectangular panels that sit on rooftops. Many people find boxy solar panels unattractive on roofs with ceramic barrel tiles, or simply don\u2019t like puncturing holes in their shingles to install panels.Mr. Musk promised to deliver the shingles at a price comparable to replacing a normal roof. But like other Tesla products, the shingles have been delayed, which the company attributed to their complexity. It said last week that it expected to ramp up production in the first half of next year.Mr. Musk\u2019s cousin Lyndon Rive, a co-founder and former chief executive of SolarCity, says he is optimistic about Tesla\u2019s long-term leadership in the solar and storage business. \u201cTesla is going to continue innovating and creating services,\u201d he said.Mr. Rive, who created SolarCity with his brother Peter in 2006, joined Tesla after his company was acquired. But the two left after a few months for undisclosed reasons.Mr. Rive acknowledged the delivery struggles that Tesla often experiences with its products.

{"Headline": "Pence Speech to String Together a Narrative of Chinese Aggression", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence will signal a far tougher American line on China on Thursday, delivering a speech in which he is expected to accuse the Chinese of aggressive moves against American warships, of predatory behavior against their neighbors, and of a sophisticated influence campaign to tilt the midterms and 2020 elections against President Trump.\u201cTo put it bluntly, President Trump\u2019s leadership is working,\u201d Mr. Pence is to say, according to excerpts from his speech provided on Wednesday night. \u201cChina wants a different American president.\u201dMr. Pence, however, will broaden the attack on China to encompass its rapid military buildup in its coastal waters; its use of debt financing to corrupt financially vulnerable countries; and its influence campaign in American news media, at think tanks and on college campuses, which he will claim is more extensive than that deployed by the Russians in 2016.\u201cBeijing has mobilized covert actors, front groups and propaganda outlets to shift Americans\u2019 perception of Chinese policies,\u201d Mr. Pence is set to say. \u201cAs a senior career member of our intelligence community recently told me, what the Russians are doing pales in comparison to what China is doing across this country.\u201dAs ties between Washington and Beijing have frayed, administration officials have been airing these grievances privately for weeks. But Mr. Pence\u2019s remarks, scheduled for 11 a.m. at the Hudson Institute in Washington, will be the first time a top American official has strung them together in a narrative of Chinese aggression, and delivered them so publicly.The White House has used Mr. Pence in this role before, notably when he attended the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and delivered a harsh message to North Korea. Weeks later, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, and Mr. Trump were in talks to meet.Mr. Pence even plans to tackle the politically charged issue of China and Taiwan. He is expected to note that the Chinese government recently persuaded three Latin American countries to break diplomatic ties with Taiwan and recognize the People\u2019s Republic of China \u2014 something the United States did in 1979 as part of its diplomatic opening to Beijing.\u201cWhile our administration will continue to respect our \u2018One China\u2019 policy, as reflected in the three joint communiqu\u00e9s and the Taiwan Relations Act, let me also say that Taiwan\u2019s embrace of democracy shows a better path for all the Chinese people,\u201d Mr. Pence is scheduled to say.After his election, Mr. Trump rattled China when he spoke on the phone with Taiwan\u2019s president and suggested that the United States might no longer abide by the One China principle. He backed off under intense pressure from Beijing.Mr. Pence is set to say that the administration drew its conclusions about China\u2019s behavior from intelligence reports, as well as from publicly available reporting. But there is no hard evidence of Chinese election meddling \u2014 at least in the excerpts provided on Wednesday evening \u2014 beyond what Mr. Trump cited last week in New York.As Mr. Trump did, Mr. Pence will cite a multipage insert that the Chinese recently placed in The Des Moines Register. The insert, aimed at American farmers, highlights the damage caused by Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war.\u201cThe supplement, designed to look like news articles, cast our trade policies as reckless and harmful to Iowans,\u201d Mr. Pence is to say. \u201cBut when our ambassador tried to place his own op-ed in Chinese newspapers, describing the truth about our policies, no Chinese outlet would publish it.\u201dSuch public relations campaigns are not unusual for countries engaged in trade disputes. The White House has not claimed that China is using the techniques that Russia used in the 2016 election, like the manipulation of social media or the hacking of email accounts.Asked to compare the Chinese and Russian interference, Mr. Trump said last week, \u201cWell, I think it\u2019s different.\u201dStill, citing intelligence agencies, Mr. Pence is to say: \u201cChina is targeting U.S. state and local governments and officials to exploit any divisions between federal and local levels on policy. It\u2019s using wedge issues, like trade tariffs, to advance Beijing\u2019s political influence.\u201dThe vice president will cite a Chinese government document, called \u201cPropaganda and Censorship Notice,\u201d which he will say lays out the goals of Beijing\u2019s influence campaign. \u201cIt states that China must \u2018strike accurately and carefully, splitting apart different domestic groups\u2019 in the United States,\u201d Mr. Pence is to say, quoting from the document.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "More Museums Are Popping Up, Annoying Their Neighbors", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetMuseums offer information, cultural awareness, a high-toned meeting place and personal enlightenment. But for the people who live or work near them, they can also bring noise and traffic congestion and can become a sinkhole for public money.But neighbors of proposed sites are pushing back out of concern over added headaches and diminished views. And city officials are becoming more resistant, fearing financial responsibility if a museum fails to reach its fund-raising goals or visitors and memberships lag, especially if the municipality issued bonds to help pay for the building.People generally view museums as an improvement to a neighborhood, said Laura B. Roberts, a museum consultant in Cambridge, Mass. \u201cThey are clean, well-maintained operations that promise economic development and add status to the neighborhood,\u201d she said.But, she added, \u201cthe traffic and parking, sometimes the noise, tend to be the flash points, especially when a museum might be sited in a residential neighborhood.\u201dThe museum is planned for Patriots Point, a 350-acre park on Charleston Harbor, where the World War II-era aircraft carrier Yorktown is docked. But the original design, submitted by the National Medal of Honor Museum Foundation, was rejected in January for exceeding the 50-foot height limit by 75 feet.A redesign of the museum, with a height of 80 feet but somewhat wider, has been proposed by the foundation\u2019s chief executive, Joseph Daniels, but initial antagonisms have not dissipated.Residents have also complained about the design, said Will Haynie, Mount Pleasant\u2019s mayor.\u201cThe sentiment that I am hearing from many citizens is that the current design does not match the coastal city they live in,\u201d he said. \u201cNor does it respect the skyline of Charleston Harbor.\u201dSome of the opposition stems from lifelong residents who view Mount Pleasant as \u201ca small town,\u201d said a Council member, Guang Ming Whitley, an intellectual property lawyer in Los Angeles who moved to Mount Pleasant with her family three years ago. \u201cThe ship has sailed on being a small town long ago,\u201d she said.In fact, Mount Pleasant is the fourth-largest city in the state, with a population of 86,668 in 2017, up from 47,609 in 2000, according to Census Bureau estimates.Ms. Whitley was concerned that if the Medal of Honor Museum is granted a height variance, other developers will see it as a precedent for their own projects. \u201cWe need to narrowly craft the variance so that it only applies to the museum and not everyone else,\u201d she said.But a bigger worry is that the museum would give up on the town entirely. Mr. Daniels said the foundation\u2019s board was re-evaluating Mount Pleasant as the site of the museum after facing \u201cheadwinds.\u201d\u201cIf Mount Pleasant or Charleston wants to put forward a proposal, we would certainly welcome it, but right now our confidence in the mayor and in Mount Pleasant itself is eroding,\u201d he said.\u201cWe were engaging and talking with stakeholders and hearing their input with various groups for nine straight years,\u201d Mr. Daniels said.Despite the animosity that can crop up in the planning stages, there is no resistance to museums in general, said John Gerner, managing director of Leisure Business Advisors, a consultant in Richmond, Va., that conducts feasibility and economic impact studies of museums, parks and zoos. \u201cMuseums tend to bring good feelings.\u201dBut some residents, he added, believe that museum developers \u201ctake advantage of that good feeling\u201d to obtain tax breaks and public financing that shifts the burden to them.His first attempt, a planned Beaux-Arts style building in San Francisco\u2019s Presidio Park, met staunch resistance. After four years of pushback, he offered to build the museum instead on undeveloped parkland between Lake Shore Drive and Lake Michigan in Chicago. But he met objections from a local preservation group and scrapped those plans.The museum will feature Mr. Lucas\u2019s a vast collection of 20th-century American book and magazine illustrations, including works by Norman Rockwell and Maxfield Parrish, as well as photographs and memorabilia from Mr. Lucas\u2019s movies.Exposition Park already has a number of cultural and sports attractions, including Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, home to the University of Southern California football team; the California Science Center, which houses the space shuttle Endeavor; and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles.\u201cExposition Park is a magnet for the region and accessible from all parts of the city,\u201d the museum said on its website, citing its proximity to \u201cmore than 100 elementary and high schools, one of the country\u2019s leading universities as well as three other world-class museums.\u201dGrouping museums together helps reduce the disturbance to the surrounding community, experts say. And the concept is starting to catch on.\u201cFor people who are nervous about the impact of a new museum in terms of traffic and noise, putting a number of them all in one place tends to contain the problems and creates a zone of economic and cultural activity,\u201d said Lisa Frehill, senior statistician at the Institute of Museum and Library Services in Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Obama Just Gave a College Grad a Job Reference. The Job? State Senator.", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWESTPORT, Conn. \u2014 When Will Haskell began his campaign for the Connecticut State Senate, he had not yet graduated from college. He was 22, the same number of years that his Republican opponent has been in state office.But for Mr. Haskell to win, he would need to succeed where many young challengers fail: It\u2019s not enough to draw curiosity and attention; donors, party leaders and, ultimately, voters, must follow.Mr. Haskell, a recent graduate from Georgetown University, is two-thirds the way toward accomplishing his goal.Donors immediately got behind Mr. Haskell: He qualified for public financing in less than a week, raising more than $29,000 from more than 450 donors; the state then gave the campaign $96,000 in election grants.Democratic leaders followed suit. Endorsements have come from Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, and Representative Jim Himes; all three have campaigned on Mr. Haskell\u2019s behalf.The momentum behind Mr. Haskell is all the more surprising given the stature of his opponent, Senator Toni Boucher, 68, a Republican who flirted with running for governor this year.Even his age has become an asset and a selling point, as the so-called blue wave has catapulted young Democrats over more seasoned incumbents across the country.Mr. Haskell\u2019s campaign manager is his college roommate at Georgetown; many of his volunteers \u2014 inspired by the advocacy by students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. \u2014 are still in high school.\u201cThose students were so eloquent, I think they paved the way for a lot of young people to get involved,\u201d Mr. Haskell said of the Parkland students.Despite his age, Mr. Haskell is no political neophyte. He interned for Mr. Murphy and Mr. Himes, studied government at Georgetown, and worked for the Democratic National Committee\u2019s voter protection team.Ms. Boucher, who serves in the Republican leadership in the Senate, would seem like an unlikely target for Democrats seeking to break the chamber\u2019s tie between Democrats and Republicans. She has captured at least 58 percent of the votes in her past three elections in the 26th Senate District, which covers much of wealthy Fairfield County.But Hillary Clinton won the district by more than 20 percentage points in 2016, and the number of registered Democrats and Republicans is almost a tie.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Gary L. Rose, a professor of government at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Conn., said Mr. Haskell has done well to overcome three substantial hurdles for young, untested candidates: name recognition, fund-raising and endorsements.\u201cIt is shocking that the race is in play,\u201d he said, citing Ms. Boucher\u2019s one unassailable advantage: her record of constituent service.\u201cThat is something he cannot claim,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what often sustains an incumbent is that they have built up a reservoir of good will among the residents of the district.\u201dBut, he added, \u201cI think there\u2019s very little question that she feels challenged in a very big way.\u201dAt a recent opening of a Republican field office in Ridgefield, Ms. Boucher certainly seemed like a candidate feeling the competition. She characterized Mr. Haskell as a \u201cprivileged, wealthy kid from a wealthy family in Westport\u201d who only had opportunities to work in the offices of Mr. Murphy and Mr. Himes because of his family\u2019s political donations to Democrats, according to a recording of her remarks obtained by The New York Times. But F.E.C. filings show Mr. Haskell\u2019s parents have never made political donations.Ms. Boucher has also accused Mr. Haskell\u2019s campaign of stealing lawn signs and conducting a push poll. Mr. Haskell has denied both accusations, pointing to his limited campaign resources and campaign finance records that show his campaign has not spent any money on polling.Ms. Boucher and her campaign dodged numerous requests for comment over the course of several days, asserting that the senator did not have the time to speak.Last week, when The Times approached Ms. Boucher after her first candidate forum with Mr. Haskell, she said she had no time to talk because of another event she had to attend that evening. Ms. Boucher then lingered at the forum for at least another 15 minutes, chatting amiably with constituents and the other Republican elected officials who appeared at the forum.Over the last week, phone calls from The Times to Ms. Boucher\u2019s aide routinely went to voice mail. When calls were placed from non-Times phone numbers, Ms. Boucher\u2019s aide answered and said the candidate was not available.Mr. Haskell said he had planned to attend law school at Georgetown, where he was accepted as a junior as part of an early admissions program for Georgetown undergraduates.Donald J. Trump\u2019s election changed that.\u201cI woke up after Trump\u2019s election, and like a lot of other people felt like I had to get involved in the fight against Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d Mr. Haskell said. \u201cThat fight starts at the local and state level.\u201dSo, he examined the positions of his local representatives, and worked his way up until reaching Ms. Boucher. Mr. Haskell said her voting record on issues of gun control, voting rights and paid family leave alarmed him.\u201cI really believe that there once was a Connecticut Republican and it was different than a Donald Trump Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cI know because my grandparents were once Connecticut Republicans, but that has faded away year by year.\u201dSo he\u2019s focused his campaign on Ms. Boucher\u2019s voting record. He sends out an email every other week highlighting Ms. Boucher\u2019s past votes, showing how he would vote differently, and at the first candidate forum last week in Ridgefield, Mr. Haskell routinely criticized her record.Mr. Haskell said he knows he needs to show his fluency on the many issues plaguing the state. A fiscal crisis with severely underfunded pensions. Major companies like General Electric leaving the state. Crumbling infrastructure.For Sue Scannell, a registered Republican who has lived in New Canaan for almost 40 years, Mr. Haskell has shown his worth. Ms. Scannell, 75, said she has consistently voted for Ms. Boucher in the past, but she will support Mr. Haskell next month. She said it was time for a generational change in Hartford.\u201cHe seems to be really attuned to what\u2019s happening around him,\u201d Ms. Scannell said. \u201cHe seems to understand what needs to be done.\u201dOther Republicans disagree, saying Mr. Haskell\u2019s policy proposals would exacerbate the state\u2019s fiscal woes.\u201cEvery policy that he wants has led us to this ditch that we\u2019re currently in,\u201d said J.R. Romano, the chairman of Connecticut\u2019s Republican Party. \u201cIf we are going to be honest about putting the state on a path to fiscal and economic prosperity, Will Haskell\u2019s more interested in pushing the interests\u201d of the Service Employees International Union, which represents a large swath of workers, such as nurses, janitors and security officers.Part of Mr. Haskell\u2019s success, observers of the race say, is his aggressive ground game. He\u2019s knocked on nearly 4,000 doors and held 115 meet-and-greets in the district. As for days off, he only recalled one since he graduated in May: helping his girlfriend move into Harvard Law School.\u201cWe spent the day building Ikea furniture,\u201d he said.Mr. Murphy, who won his first race to serve as a state representative at the age of 25 and was elected to the United States Senate when he was 39, said Mr. Haskell\u2019s age should not inhibit his candidacy. Mr. Haskell, he said, has \u201ctremendous energy and is whip-smart.\u201d\u201cI think that voters in Connecticut don\u2019t pay a lot of attention to age,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cIf they did, I wouldn\u2019t be in the United States Senate. They want to know whether you\u2019re experienced, whether you have the energy and whether you have good ideas, and Will has all of that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Surprising Truths About Trade Deficits", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewMr. Trump\u2019s confusion is understandable. Economists have spent centuries studying trade, debunking common myths and arriving at some surprising truths.Let\u2019s review, both for the president and ourselves, some conclusions about trade that most economists accept but, upon first hearing, are not at all obvious.To understand what\u2019s wrong with that inference, consider some of the many bilateral trade deficits that I run. Whenever my family goes out to dinner, the restaurateur gets some money, and we get a meal. In economics parlance, the Mankiw family runs a trade deficit with that restaurant. But that doesn\u2019t make us losers. After all, we leave with full stomachs.To be sure, I would be happy to have balanced trade. I would be delighted if every time my family went out to dinner, the restaurateur bought one of my books. But it would be harebrained for me to expect that or to boycott restaurants that had no interest in adding to their collection of economics textbooks.I can run persistent trade deficits with restaurants because I run trade surpluses elsewhere. Take The New York Times, for instance. It pays me more for my columns than I pay it for my subscription. That\u2019s a bilateral trade surplus for me and a bilateral trade deficit for The Times. But nonetheless, we both gain from the relationship.To see the folly in that conclusion, consider again the Mankiw family. Our overall trade balance is the sum of all our bilateral trade balances with everyone else \u2014 restaurants, The Times, and so on. The end result equals the difference between our income and our spending.If our overall trade balance is positive, we are spending less than we are earning, meaning we are saving. If our overall trade balance is negative, we are spending more than we are earning. In the language of economists, we are dissaving.Whether a trade deficit represents a problem depends on whether our spending is prudent or profligate. When a family takes out a loan to buy a car, it runs a trade deficit, but that need not be a reason for concern, as long as it can afford the car in the long run.On the other hand, if a family runs a trade deficit by persistently living beyond its means, that\u2019s a problem because debts eventually come due. But in this case, the trouble comes not from disreputable trading partners but from poor financial planning. If you eat at expensive restaurants too often, blame yourself, not the restaurateur.Similar reasoning applies to countries. Nations run trade deficits when their spending on consumption and investment, both private and public, exceeds the value of goods and services they produce. If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonize trading partners around the world.Mr. Trump thinks the trade deficit makes us losers in international trade, so he wants to shrink it. But many of his initiatives actually push in the opposite direction.The tax cuts, for example, tend to increase private spending, by both households on consumption goods and businesses on investment goods. Reduced business regulation should also stimulate investment spending. Because the trade deficit represents an excess of spending over production, this increased spending results in a larger trade deficit.Movements in the exchange rate help explain the link between spending and the trade deficit. As spending in the United States increases, the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates to keep inflation in check. Higher interest rates attract capital inflows from abroad, causing the dollar to appreciate. A stronger dollar makes our exports more expensive and our imports cheaper.All this isn\u2019t to say that the president\u2019s policies are necessarily misguided. The tax bill should be interpreted on its own merits \u2014 whether it makes the tax system fairer and more efficient and whether it brings in enough revenue to finance the government. And each regulatory change should be evaluated based on its costs and benefits.What these policies do to the trade deficit is, at most, a secondary concern. In many ways, the trade deficit is a fake problem. Our elected leaders should look elsewhere to gauge the success of their policies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Lost Rural America. This Former Rodeo Star Thinks He Can Win It Back.", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBROOKINGS, S.D. \u2014 First came the Republicans, all smiles and matching blue T-shirts as they marched in this college town\u2019s annual Hobo Day homecoming parade. Then the tractor team rolled past, and the dairy club, and the Corn Palace Shriners.Finally, at the end of the line: the Democrats. Behind as usual.Farmers and ranchers from this rural state once sent liberal icons like George McGovern to Congress, but these days, Democrats have all but vanished into the plains, a stark example of how far the party has tumbled in rural America. They hold no statewide elected offices in South Dakota. They make up less than 20 percent of the State Legislature. Their numbers are shrinking so fast that they rank below registered independents in a dozen counties.But on a sunny Saturday, shaking hands and nudging his wheelchair up the parade route, came Billie Sutton, a 34-year-old state senator and onetime rodeo rider who is making a surprisingly competitive run for governor against South Dakota\u2019s four-term Republican congresswoman, Kristi Noem.Mr. Sutton is running as an anti-abortion conservative Democrat with cowboy cred and a stirring life story. His supporters think he can show Democrats how to start rebuilding the party in socially conservative states where the ag-heavy economy rises and falls with rain cycles and soybean prices.At 23, Mr. Sutton was one of the world\u2019s top saddle bronco riders when the horse he\u2019d drawn in a circuit event in North Dakota reared up and smashed him into the chute in October 2007. He still remembers the horse\u2019s name: Ruby. In an instant, Mr. Sutton was paralyzed from the waist down and his rodeo career was over.\u201cHe\u2019s a South Dakota boy,\u201d said Tara Vanderwal, who slapped on a blue Sutton sticker at the parade.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t act like a politician,\u201d said her husband, Phil, a Republican who said he is leaning toward Mr. Sutton.But to have any shot in this conservative-dominated state, Mr. Sutton will need to persuade thousands more Phil Vanderwals.Democrats in South Dakota have not won a governor\u2019s race in 44 years. They have 95,000 fewer registered voters than Republicans \u2014 a huge and widening gap in a state of just 870,000 people. And Ms. Noem has a powerful supporter campaigning for her: President Trump, who won South Dakota by 30 points in 2016, and raised more than $518,000 for her at an event last month.One afternoon, on the Sutton family\u2019s ranch overlooking the Missouri River, the candidate\u2019s father, Bill, summed up his son\u2019s problem: \u201cHe\u2019s going to need a lot of Trump supporters to win.\u201dIn campaign ads shot on the family ranch, Mr. Sutton tells and tells the story of how his rodeo injury propelled him toward public service. He gives speeches denouncing corruption scandals and secrecy in the Republican-led state government, and pledges to give a voice to struggling farmers and ranchers.To South Dakota\u2019s handful of liberals, it sometimes feels like he is running as an anti-Democrat. He is pro-gun, anti-abortion and says he opposes a state income tax. He has a Republican running mate. He deflects when asked about social issues that divide Democrats from most South Dakotans, like whether he would have voted to confirm Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\u201cThe national party hasn\u2019t been engaged with a good message,\u201d Mr. Sutton said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been relating to people in the Midwest. It used to be fighting for the little guy.\u201dIn a normal year, this would all be fodder for a Nice Try campaign that ended with a 20-point loss. But Democrats here are starved for a win, and a bitter Republican primary has left some conservatives angry with Ms. Noem\u2019s campaign. A handful of Republicans who supported the South Dakota attorney general, Marty Jackley, in the Republican primary have now publicly signed on with Mr. Sutton.The Cook Political Report recently declared the race a \u201ctoss-up\u201d \u2014 rather than a Republican layup. Assessing the true state of the race in a thinly populated rural state like South Dakota is difficult. Partisan surveys from Democrats have showed a tight race, but there have not been any independent public polls of the race so far.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.\u201cAfter four decades there\u2019s this perception that a Democrat just can\u2019t win,\u201d said Tom Daschle, the former Senate majority leader from South Dakota who lost his seat in 2004. \u201cThis year that\u2019s changing.\u201dNot yet. Ms. Noem, 46, a rancher and farmer herself, is a tough opponent also running a history-setting campaign. She would become South Dakota\u2019s first female governor, and her supporters say her own life story is proof of her grit and goodness.Twenty years ago, she interrupted her college education to take over the family ranch after her father was killed in a farming accident. She finished up her bachelor\u2019s years later, in 2012, as a freshman member of Congress.With Congress now in recess, Ms. Noem is crisscrossing the state. She is steeped in South Dakota policy, and spent one campaign day with voters diving into the weeds of nursing-home payments, hunting regulations, water-use policy and even property-tax rates in Brown County. At every stop, she dinged Mr. Sutton as a lightweight and a liberal in cowboy clothes.At a supermarket cafe in Aberdeen where she discussed education with about 80 supporters, Ms. Noem pointed out that she had 14 detailed governing plans on her website.\u201cI think he\u2019s got like five,\u201d she said of Mr. Sutton.Many of the people she met over caramel rolls had deep-red gripes about the country: Democrats had disgraced the country during the Kavanaugh nomination. People on government assistance should be drug-tested. Environmental regulations and taxes were strangling farmers and businesses.As Ms. Noem nodded and answered their questions, she pitched herself as an experienced chief executive who was just as South Dakotan as Mr. Sutton. When a voter asked her why they should elect yet another Republican governor, Ms. Noem said she saw her character was forged by working a ranch, running small businesses and teaching Sunday school, not simply being a Republican.\u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cyou should also remember that Billie Sutton is a Democrat.\u201dRobert and Travis Swisher, father-and-son farmers, agreed with that as they listened to Ms. Noem at a Dairy Queen in Groton. Yes, Mr. Sutton seemed like a decent guy, they said. But they could not imagine voting for any Democrat, no matter his background or policies.\u201cThere are no more Democrats like when Dad was growing up,\u201d Travis, the son, said. Ms. Noem\u2019s campaign is aiming to capitalize on that sentiment by linking Mr. Sutton to Hillary Clinton.But some conservatives said they were giving Mr. Sutton a close look. They said that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies were hurting their farms, and that Republican policies had done little to bring down their health care costs.Hope Block, a finance officer in Groton, S.D., said she would support expanding Medicaid \u2014 a position favored by Mr. Sutton and opposed by Ms. Noem. Wayne Wasilk said his 100-cow dairy farm was struggling, and he liked what he had heard from Mr. Sutton.\u201cNobody has the farmers\u2019 and ranchers\u2019 back right now,\u201d Mr. Sutton said.As much as farmers are worried, the rest of the state\u2019s economy is humming. Overall unemployment is 3 percent, and there might not be enough discontent for voters to break with the Republican Party.Four years ago, Rick Weiland, a Sioux Falls businessman, ran a populist campaign to unseat South Dakota\u2019s junior Republican senator, Mike Rounds. He thinks Mr. Sutton\u2019s anti-corruption message will resonate.But when he was campaigning in 2014, he said he would pull into some tiny town cafe, bent on winning over voters who may have been overlooked by candidates before. Mr. Weiland said they would thank him for visiting, and ask his party. When he told them he was a Democrat, they would tell him they just couldn\u2019t vote for someone in his party.\u201cThey\u2019d roll their eyes like, \u2018Oh that\u2019s too bad,\u201d he said, \u201cand walk away.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "11 Takeaways From The Times\u2019s Investigation Into Trump\u2019s Wealth", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDonald J. Trump built a business empire and won the presidency proclaiming himself a self-made billionaire, and he has long insisted that his father, the legendary New York City builder Fred C. Trump, provided almost no financial help. \u201cI built what I built myself,\u201d the president has repeatedly said.In all, the president\u2019s parents transferred well over $1 billion in wealth to their children, which could have produced a tax bill of at least $550 million under the 55 percent tax rate on gifts and inheritances that was in place at the time. Helped by a variety of tax dodges, the Trumps paid $52.2 million, or about 5 percent, tax returns show.The president declined requests over several weeks to comment for this article.A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Charles J. Harder, provided a written statement. \u201cThere was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone. The facts upon which The Times bases its false allegations are extremely inaccurate,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever with these matters,\u201d he continued, saying the president had delegated those tasks to relatives and tax professionals. \u201cThe affairs were handled by other Trump family members who were not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law.\u201dIn a statement on behalf of the Trump family, the president\u2019s brother, Robert Trump, said, \u201cAll appropriate gift and estate tax returns were filed, and the required taxes were paid.\u201dHere are some key takeaways.The line between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion is often murky, and there is no shortage of clever tax-avoidance tricks that have been blessed by either the courts or the Internal Revenue Service itself; the wealthiest Americans rarely pay anything close to full freight. The Trumps\u2019 tax maneuvers met with little resistance from the I.R.S., The Times found.But tax experts briefed on The Times\u2019s findings said the Trumps appeared to have done more than exploit legal loopholes. They said the conduct described here represented a pattern of deception and obfuscation that repeatedly prevented the I.R.S. from taxing large transfers of wealth to Fred Trump\u2019s children.In Donald Trump\u2019s version of how he got rich, he was the master dealmaker who broke free from his father\u2019s \u201ctiny\u201d Brooklyn and Queens real estate operation and built a $10 billion empire that would slap the Trump name on hotels, high-rises, casinos and golf courses the world over.But The Times\u2019s investigation makes clear that in every era of Mr. Trump\u2019s life, his finances were deeply entwined with, and dependent on, his father\u2019s wealth. By age 3, he was earning $200,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars from his father\u2019s empire. He was a millionaire by age 8. In his 40s and 50s, he was receiving more than $5 million a year.There was a clear pattern to this largess: When his son began expensive new projects, Fred Trump increased his help. In the late 1970s, when Donald Trump crossed the river into the glittering precincts of Manhattan \u2014 converting the old Commodore Hotel near Grand Central Terminal into a Grand Hyatt \u2014 his father opened a spigot of loans. When he made his first forays into Atlantic City casinos a few years later, his father devised a plan to sharply increase the flow of aid.In Mr. Trump\u2019s books and TV shows and on the campaign trail, a central trope of his self-mythology has been that, as he began building his own empire, the only financial help he got from his father was a $1 million loan. Not only that: \u201cI had to pay him back with interest.\u201dIn fact, The Times found, Fred Trump lent his son at least $60.7 million, or $140 million in today\u2019s dollars. Much of it was never repaid, records show.As the 1980s ended, Donald Trump\u2019s big bets began to go bust \u2014 Trump Shuttle, the Plaza Hotel, the Atlantic City casinos. But as he careened from one financial disaster to another, family partnerships and companies dramatically increased their payouts.Between 1989 and 1992, four of the entities that Fred Trump created paid his son today\u2019s equivalent of $8.3 million. And when Donald Trump pleaded with bankers for an emergency line of credit, he used as collateral the stake his father had given him in a group of apartment buildings.Tax records also reveal that at the peak of Mr. Trump\u2019s financial distress, in 1990, his father extracted an extraordinary sum \u2014 nearly $50 million \u2014 from his empire. While The Times could find no evidence that Fred Trump made any significant debt payments, charitable donations or personal expenditures, there are indications that he wanted plenty of cash on hand to bail out his son if need be.That was what happened at Trump\u2019s Castle casino, where an $18.4 million bond payment was due in December 1990. Fred Trump dispatched a trusted bookkeeper to Atlantic City with checks to buy $3.5 million in casino chips without placing a bet. With this ruse \u2014 an illegal loan under New Jersey gaming laws, resulting in a $65,000 civil penalty \u2014 Donald Trump narrowly avoided defaulting on his bonds.By 1987, Donald Trump\u2019s loan debt to his father had grown to at least $11 million. Had Fred Trump simply forgiven the debt, his son would have owed millions in income taxes. They found another solution \u2014 one that appears to constitute both an unreported multimillion-dollar gift and an illegal tax write-off.That December, records show, Fred Trump spent $15.5 million to buy a 7.5 percent stake in Trump Palace, his son\u2019s condo tower rising on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Four years later, tax returns and financial statements show, Fred Trump sold that stake for just $10,000. The buyer, other documents indicate, was his son.According to tax experts, with Trump Palace condos selling briskly, selling shares worth $15.5 million to your son for a mere sliver of that would constitute a multimillion-dollar gift under I.R.S. rules. But Fred Trump\u2019s tax returns show no such gift to Donald Trump. What they do reveal is that he used the transaction to declare an enormous tax write-off. That appears to violate federal tax law that prohibits deducting any loss from the sale or exchange of property between family members.In all, Fred Trump dodged roughly $8 million in gift taxes and $5 million in income taxes on the transaction.All told, The Times documented 295 distinct streams of revenue Fred Trump created over five decades to channel wealth to his son.But the partnership between Donald Trump and his father was about more than the pursuit, and the preservation, of riches. They were also confederates in a more ambitious project: creating the myth of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire. If Fred Trump was the silent partner, helping finance the accouterments of wealth, it was Donald Trump who spun them into a seductive narrative.Emblematic of this dynamic is Trump Tower, the talisman of privilege that established Donald Trump as a player in New York. Fred Trump\u2019s money helped build it. His son recognized and exploited its iconic power as the primary stage for both \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and his presidential campaign.In December 1990, Donald Trump sent his father a document that left him both angered and alarmed. It was a codicil seeking to make a variety of changes to Fred Trump\u2019s will. Among them: strengthening provisions that made Donald Trump sole executor of his estate. But amid Mr. Trump\u2019s financial shambles \u2014 it was the month of the $3.5 million Trump\u2019s Castle rescue \u2014 Fred Trump feared that the document potentially put his life\u2019s work at risk, that his son might use the empire as collateral to save his own failing businesses, according to depositions given years later during a family dispute.Fred Trump rebuffed the maneuver, refusing to sign the codicil. But the episode prompted a family reckoning: Fred Trump was aging and ailing. Without speedy intervention, he could die leaving a vast estate \u2014 not just his real estate empire, but also tens of millions of dollars in cash \u2014 vulnerable to the 55 percent inheritance tax.So with Donald Trump playing a central role, the family formulated a plan that included unorthodox tax strategies that experts told The Times were legally dubious and, in some cases, appeared to be fraudulent.The first major component was creating a company called All County Building Supply & Maintenance. On paper, All County was Fred Trump\u2019s purchasing agent, buying everything from boilers to cleaning supplies. But All County was, in fact, a company only on paper, records and interviews show \u2014 a vehicle to siphon cash from Fred Trump\u2019s empire by simply marking up purchases already made by his employees. Those millions in markups, effectively untaxed gifts, then flowed to All County\u2019s owners \u2014 Donald Trump, his siblings and a cousin.Lee-Ford Tritt, a leading expert in gift and estate tax law at the University of Florida, said the Trumps\u2019 use of All County was \u201chighly suspicious\u201d and could constitute criminal tax fraud. \u201cIt certainly looks like a disguised gift,\u201d he said.All County also had an insidious downside for Fred Trump\u2019s tenants. He used the padded invoices to justify higher rent increases in rent-regulated buildings, records show.Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, disputed The Times\u2019s reporting: \u201cShould The Times state or imply that President Trump participated in fraud, tax evasion or any other crime, it will be exposing itself to substantial liability and damages for defamation.\u201dWith the cash flowing out of Fred Trump\u2019s empire, the Trumps began transferring ownership of the lion\u2019s share of the empire itself to Donald Trump and his siblings. The vehicle they created to do that was a special kind of trust called a grantor-retained annuity trust, or GRAT.The purpose of a GRAT is to pass wealth across generations without paying the 55 percent estate tax. The Trump parents did have to pay gift taxes based on one crucial number: the market value of Fred Trump\u2019s empire. But The Times found evidence that they dodged hundreds of millions of dollars in gift taxes by submitting tax returns that grossly undervalued the assets placed in two GRATs, one for each parent.Fred Trump\u2019s 1995 gift tax return claimed that the 25 apartment complexes and other properties in the trusts were worth just $41.4 million. The implausibility of this claim would be made plain in 2004, when banks valued that same real estate at nearly $900 million.\u201cThey play around with valuations in extreme ways,\u201d said Mr. Tritt, the tax law expert, who was briefed on The Times\u2019s findings. \u201cThere are dramatic fluctuations depending on their purpose.\u201dMr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, said: \u201cAll estate matters were handled by licensed attorneys, licensed C.P.A.\u2019s and licensed real estate appraisers who followed all laws and rules strictly.\u201dWhen Fred Trump died in June 1999 at the age of 93, the vast bulk of his empire was nowhere to be found in his estate \u2014 testament to the success of the tax strategies devised by the Trumps in the early 1990s. The single largest item included in his estate tax return was a $10.3 million I.O.U. from Donald Trump, money his son appears to have borrowed the year before he died. As for the remnants of empire left in Fred Trump\u2019s estate, the tax return cited appraisals that once again grossly understated their market values.As their father\u2019s executors, Donald, Maryanne and Robert Trump were legally responsible for the accuracy of his estate tax return. They were obligated not only to give the I.R.S. a complete accounting of the value of his estate\u2019s assets, but also to disclose all the taxable gifts he had made during his lifetime. If they knew anything was wrong and failed to reveal it, tax experts said, they could be in violation of tax law.Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, defended the tax returns filed by the Trumps. \u201cThe returns and tax positions that The Times now attacks were examined in real time by the relevant taxing authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cThese matters have now been closed for more than a decade.\u201dIn 2003, once again in financial trouble, Donald Trump began engineering the sale of the empire Fred Trump had hoped would never leave the family. The sale, completed in 2004, brought him his biggest payday ever from his father: His cut was $177.3 million, or $236.2 million in today\u2019s dollars. But as it turned out, banks at the time valued the empire at hundreds of millions more than the sale price. Donald Trump, master dealmaker, had sold low.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe asked people who recently made their first donations to election campaigns what motivated them to reach into their pockets. We wanted to know what motivated them to do it. So we asked first-time donors to tell us their stories. We heard from people aged 18 to 80 who had donated anywhere from $3 to $2,500 to candidates running for state and national offices. Their comments have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. I just turned 80 years old and have decided for the first time to donate time and money to prevent a catastrophe. As I enter the final chapter of my life, I just cannot stand idly by and watch this unchecked fearmonger and the enabling Republicans essentially destroy our democracy. The thought of Nancy Pelosi back in control is an unacceptable situation! The Affordable Care Act has meant members of my family losing their doctors! Their excellent coverage went to H.M.O.s that their doctors did not take, with higher-cost plans that covered nothing like what they had! So that\u2019s why I gave as much as I could afford.\u2014 Ron Cassoni, 65, Austin, Tex., donated $2,500 to Republican candidates for Congress. I have never experienced actual relief financially from any other president. This is a new and invigorating feeling. You may not like the president, but he is affecting our wallets in a positive way.My whole life I never felt great affinity toward any party (there were good and bad positions with each one), but I now find that Trump is doing everything he promised to do. This is unusual and unprecedented in my 58 years. My taxes are lower. There are more jobs for everyone, including minorities. The threat of, and continuous involvement in, wars is diminishing, and the bloated government bureaucracy with its multitude of regulations has been dramatically reduced. I believe that if Democrats gain a majority in the House, all the energy in Washington will be spent trying to undo all the good accomplishments of the past two years.\u2014 Robin Tucker, 58, Portland, Me., donates $3 to $5 monthly to President Trump.I was deeply moved by Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s explanation of why he supports N.F.L. players kneeling in pursuit of their free-speech rights. Although I live in California, I sent his campaign money for the first time in my life. I believe this is the type of person to restore America to its time-honored values of life, liberty and the pursuit of freedom.I donated a small amount to the Beto O\u2019Rourke campaign. It was the first time I had ever donated, seeing as I am only 19 years old. I am not registered to vote in Texas; I'm registered in Alabama. But I wanted to show my support for Beto even though I cannot do so on Election Day. \u2014 Samuel Gass, 19, Auburn, Ala., donated $10 to Mr. O\u2019Rourke. This will be my first time voting in a midterm election. I live in Texas and, whether or not it will actually happen, getting Beto into office feels like it\u2019s something we\u2019re so close to accomplishing. The campaign sent me an email asking for a minimal donation, and with all of the hyperbolic, fear-inciting rhetoric that Trump and the G.O.P. are spouting, I felt it was the least I could do to move the needle back toward reason.\u2014 Riane Cretney, 25, Dallas, donated $3 to Mr. O\u2019Rourke. I decided to donate this year because Beto O\u2019Rourke is running such a positive, clean, stellar campaign. His town halls are friendly and inclusive, and that right there resonates with me. While his town halls have grown in size of late, my favorite one was held out in West Texas with about a dozen people at a doughnut shop, pulling tables and chairs together, a woman rocking a toddler to sleep, everyone lowering their voices just a touch, and continuing to discuss things like immigration and farming. Pure Texas.\u2014 Gabe Arnold, 64, Texas, donated $50 to Mr. O\u2019Rourke.I decided to donate because I turned 18 this year and I felt that, with my new responsibility to be a part of our democratic process, I needed to support my political views more than just sharing them with others. \u2014 Wade Atkinson, 18, Amherst, Mass., donated $10 each to Senator Elizabeth Warren in Massachusetts, the state representative candidate Mindy Domb in Massachusetts, the Senate candidate Kyrsten Sinema in Arizona, Senator Bill Nelson in Florida and Senator Dianne Feinstein in California. I\u2019m 22 now and working full time, so I can actually afford it. I was in college the past two elections and was dirt poor. I can still only give between $10 and $20 to a few candidates whose races I know are very tight. But I know small donations like that do make a difference and it speaks volumes when campaigns are receiving a large chunk of their money from small donors instead of PACs.\u2014 Ana Moylan, 22, Suwanee, Ga., donated $10 to $20 to Stacey Abrams for her governor\u2019s race in Georgia, Beto O\u2019Rourke for his Senate race in Texas, Phil Bredesen for his Senate race in Tennessee, Senator Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota, Andrew Gillum for his governor\u2019s race in Florida and Carolyn Bourdeaux for her congressional race in Georgia. First, as a permanent resident [a green card holder], I don\u2019t have the ability to vote in U.S. elections. The one opportunity I have to participate is by donating. Second, more than ever, the 2016 election showed me that immigrants to the United States will always be viewed with suspicion. As a result, donating made sense as a way to both reaffirm my American identity and to invest in a system that would treat all Americans equally.\u2014 James Qian, 24, Tempe, Ariz., donated $100 to Kyrsten Sinema for her Senate race in Arizona. As a gay man, far right governments are inherently dangerous to my very safety and existence, so I donated money to Democrats to help them win.\u2014 Joseph Russel, 21, Los Angeles, donated $20 to Andrew Gillum for his governor\u2019s race in Florida and $20 to Lauren Underwood for her congressional race in Illinois. I am a Democrat, and have never voted Republican, but today for the first time I donated money to a campaign. I donated to President Trump so he can continue campaigning across the country ahead of the midterms.\u2014 Tom Mattson, 42, Los Angeles, donated $50 to President Trump. As a lifelong Republican, I am ashamed to see what my party has become. Living in Virginia, I donated to a Democrat\u2019s campaign \u2014 this was the first time I had ever donated to any nominee\u2019s campaign for any party. It\u2019s not that I agree with Democrats, but I so fear what another two years of unchecked Republican-dictated policymaking will do to our country, specifically in regard to the environment. I\u2019m disgusted by what Republicans have become, and I\u2019m no longer going to sit by and vote for party over principles.\u2014 Greg Jensen, 28, Colonial Beach, Va., donated $10 to Senator Tim Kaine in Virginia.I was a solid Republican my whole life, but my party marched to the ridiculous right without me. In 2016, I sat on the sidelines, shaking my head as my conservative Christian friends touted Trump, but solidly convinced that he couldn\u2019t win. I won\u2019t make that mistake again. I donated to House and Senate campaigns this year, put campaign signs in my yard and sent many, many messages to Washington with Resistbot, all for the first time. Being active is my new normal.\u2014 John Kaufeld, 56, Fort Wayne, Ind., donated $25 each to Senator Joe Donnelly and the congressional candidate Courtney Tritch in Indiana. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Female Candidates Break Barriers, Except When It Comes to Money", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRashida Tlaib, running in a tough six-way Democratic primary for a House seat in Michigan and positioning herself to be the first Muslim woman in Congress, was thrilled when a man who champions Muslim candidates across the country donated just under $1,000 to her campaign.Then she found out he had given three times as much \u2014 $2,700, the maximum allowed under federal law \u2014 to Representative Keith Ellison, the first Muslim man in Congress.\u201cIt\u2019s not like you can call and ask why,\u201d Ms. Tlaib said in an interview. So she did what she always does and wrote the donor a handwritten thank you note. When she won the primary and was all but assured of winning the seat \u2014 she has no Republican opponent in November \u2014 he maxed out to her, too.Women have broken many barriers in this midterm election cycle: Record numbers have run for Congress and record numbers have won primaries, including a record number of women of color like Ms. Tlaib.Women are newly asserting themselves as donors, too, often helping female candidates; while donations from women to Republican men have dropped off a cliff since the election of President Trump, donations from women to Democratic women have shot up, reflecting a trend the Women\u2019s Philanthropy Institute calls \u201crage giving.\u201dBut women who run for office are still struggling to raise as much as men, particularly if they are Republican, or challenging incumbents, or running in places where the opposing party has a big advantage \u2014 as is the case with many Democratic women this year. Men are still making the large majority of political contributions, and male candidates are still raising more money.Female candidates have relied on different or new ways to raise money, getting more in small donations, from individual donors and from women. Still, even in a year when fervor for a \u201cblue wave\u201d has allowed many competitive female candidates to raise staggering amounts of money, it has taken them longer to raise it.\u201cWomen work it,\u201d said Ms. Tlaib, a former state legislator. \u201cWe work twice as hard. At some point that may change, but we have to work twice as hard.\u201dAmong Democratic primary winners on the ballot for House seats, women have raised an average of $1.4 million, $185,000 less than the average for men, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Traditionally, women haven\u2019t raised as much money because they haven\u2019t had the same network of business connections, or the fortunes to self-fund their campaigns. That\u2019s still true among the top fund-raisers.In the House, for example, Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat running for an open seat in the New Jersey suburbs, has raised $7.5 million, more than any woman running, according to a list compiled by the center earlier this month. Five male candidates have outraised her \u2014 all Democrats \u2014 but three of them are largely self-financed; the top man on the list, David Trone, running for a solidly Democratic open seat in Maryland, contributed nearly $16 million of his total $16.5 million haul.Ms. Sherrill, by contrast, has spent just $1,800 of her own money.Female candidates have also benefited from heightened interest among voters and donors in supporting women and outsider candidates this year; many of them have put out inspirational videos that can set off a flood of small-dollar contributions. Amy McGrath, who raised the second-highest amount among female House candidates, and like Ms. Sherrill is a Naval Academy graduate and former military pilot, announced her campaign for a Kentucky seat in a video that cast her as a fighter. She has raised 24 percent of her money from donors who gave $200 or less.The Republican incumbent she is challenging, Representative Andy Barr, has raised just 4 percent from small donors; 40 percent of his contributions come from political action committees; only 4 percent of Ms. McGrath\u2019s do.\u201cWomen are finding ways around the incredible war chest advantage that members of Congress who are incumbents bring to any race they run in,\u201d said Sarah Bryner, the research director at the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks money in politics.\u201cWe\u2019re approaching equity in terms of campaign fund-raising,\u201d Ms. Bryner said, \u201cbut there are still specific groups having a harder time.\u201dThat includes the many Democratic women who are running in solidly red House districts where they are unlikely to win. In Texas, for example, Jennie Lou Leeder has raised nearly $79,000 compared with the Republican incumbent\u2019s $2 million.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Among non-incumbent Republicans on the ballot for House races in November, women have done slightly better, on average, than men; they have raised about $46,000 more, with an average of $565,402.Still, they have raised far less on average than the Democratic candidates they are running against. In California, for example, Young Kim, seen as one of her party\u2019s best hopes, has raised $2.5 million. Her male Democratic opponent, Gil Cisneros, has raised nearly five times as much.Many women in competitive races are being outraised by men who are unlikely to win. Andrew Janz, a Democrat running in a solidly Republican district in California, has raised $8.2 million, more than any of the Democratic women running in several California districts where the party is favored to win.The elections in 2010 were a mirror of this year: then, a Democratic president was facing his first midterms, the Republicans set their record for the number of women running for Congress \u2014 and Republican men outraised Republican women.\u201cIf you\u2019re a woman running for office, you come in, they grill you on your policies, they grill you on everything, and then they give you $1,000,\u201d said Sarah Chamberlain, the chief executive of the Main Street Partnership, which supports moderate Republican candidates. \u201cA man goes in, they grill him a bit, but they also talk sports and other things, then they give him $2,700.\u201dMs. Nickloes entered the race in the spring and struggled to raise money against candidates she called \u201cgood ol\u2019 boys who knew all the right people.\u201d\u201cI felt like I wanted to beat myself against a brick wall sometimes, the number of times I heard \u2018retribution,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cPeople would say, \u201cWe fear retribution, this person has such strong backing.\u2019 That was extremely frustrating.\u201dMs. Nickloes raised nearly $150,000 in individual contributions, and Ms. Chamberlain\u2019s political arm came in with nearly $100,000 a few weeks before the primary \u2014 allowing Ms. Nickloes to produce and air one television ad. She came in third, behind two men who had raised more money.One opponent told her she had polled at just 1 percent name recognition two months before the primary. \u201cThat tells you what that commercial did for me,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we had just had that money earlier, we would have been unstoppable.\u201dDemocratic women have taken advantage of a continued backlash against President Trump, who won office with the largest gender gap on record. Forty-three percent of donations to Democratic women who won primaries in House races, and 47 percent for the Senate, have come from women, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics.Representative Jacky Rosen, for example, the Democrat challenging Senator Dean Heller in Nevada, has eight times as many female donors as Mr. Heller, raising a total of $5.4 million from women, according to the center\u2019s analysis.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.Overall, women have donated about $126 million to Democratic women in congressional races this year, according to the center, and $85 million to Republican men. That\u2019s a flip from 2016, when women donated $106 million to Republican men and $75 million to Democratic women.Despite the increased giving from women, men still contribute most of the money \u2014 65 percent in congressional campaigns, according to the center.But female candidates are trying to change that. In September Representative Lois Frankel of Florida led five other Democratic incumbents to start Elect Democratic Women, a political action committee to raise money for candidates who support abortion rights.Earlier this month, the Women of South Florida Victory Fund held a fund-raiser featuring Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic House leader, to benefit four women seeking House seats.One of those women, Lauren Baer, a Harvard and Oxford-educated lawyer who worked in the Obama administration, has showcased her wife and their young children in her campaign literature. That, she said, has helped her raise money not only from politically connected friends, but from many women and members of the L.G.B.T.Q. community.Earlier this month, a woman involved in her campaign invited 40 other mothers to her house for a fund-raiser at 8:30 in the morning. Many women brought their young daughters.\u201cNone of them have previously been engaged in political giving, but they are energized to see someone like them running for office, and they want to show that example to their daughters,\u201d Ms. Baer said. \u201cWhat that is showing is the power of female candidates to build new political coalitions that will redefine the shape of our parties and our electoral politics for decades to come.\u201dMore recent fund-raising numbers suggest that donors give more to women once they become more serious candidates. In the second quarter, which ended in June, there were 16 men and four women on a list of the top 20 non-incumbent fund-raisers for House races compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics; in the last cycle, which ended after the primaries, nine women made the list.\u201cWe\u2019re still new to the arena,\u201d Ms. Tlaib, in Michigan, said. \u201cI think when people start seeing more women run and win, more will invest.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "War by Other Means", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome American officials appear to hope that resumed sanctions on Iran will lead to a popular uprising. Have they thought that through?Ms. Giacomo is a member of the editorial board.In resuming sanctions, Mr. Trump hopes to force Iran to capitulate to unrealistic American demands, including ending all its nuclear activity and ceasing its military role in Syria and Yemen.It\u2019s unclear whether the administration has really considered the potential consequences of its actions. They may have the opposite effect of what is intended, by strengthening Iran\u2019s hard-liners and stoking more regional instability.Crucially, Mr. Trump has failed to enlist Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China \u2014 the major powers that joined the United States in negotiating the nuclear deal \u2014 in his anti-Iran crusade. The Europeans say the deal is in their national security interest; they resent that Mr. Trump has unilaterally upended it.Some analysts say it could eventually benefit competitors eager to replace the dollar as the world\u2019s dominant currency and do long-term damage to the United States.Mr. Trump faces other trouble as well. No matter how painful the reimposed sanctions are, they won\u2019t be as effective as when the major powers were united in their enforcement. China, India and Japan have signaled a willingness to continue at least some purchases from Iran.As history shows, sanctions are most effective when they are applied judiciously and with broad international support. Conversely, the United States and its partners must be willing to remove sanctions when the target country changes its behavior. President Barack Obama saw the nuclear deal as a way to prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon, to ease the hostility that has dominated relations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and to appeal to a new generation of pro-Western Iranians.That not only didn\u2019t happen, but in many ways Iran\u2019s malign regional behavior has grown worse, a bad call by the country\u2019s leaders.Iran is already struggling with a fragile economy and internal unrest, and some American officials hope a tightening vise will lead to a popular uprising. This tough approach, backed by Israel and Saudi Arabia, reached a crescendo last month when Mr. Trump and top advisers used a series of speeches to mount a coordinated verbal attack on Iran\u2019s government and to warn of dark consequences if it doesn\u2019t change its behavior.So could Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line approach indeed spark regime change? And then what?Despite recent unrest and economic weakening, experts say Iran\u2019s government isn\u2019t expected to fall any time soon.If Mr. Trump had stuck with the nuclear agreement, he would have had the standing to lead an effort with the five other major powers to address concerns over Iran\u2019s military presence in Syria, its missile program, its support for militant groups like Hezbollah, its hostility toward Israel and its backing for Houthi rebels in Yemen. Instead, he has alienated America\u2019s closest allies and set the stage for a conflict that could easily spiral out of control.An earlier version of this editorial misstated the nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It is not a weapons program.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Big Pharma Fears Most: A Trump Alliance With Democrats to Cut Drug Prices", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The pharmaceutical industry, pilloried by President Trump for the last two years, is war-gaming for the possibility that its worst fear is realized: that Democrats, if they flip control of the House, find common ground with the president to rein in drug prices.Democrats say they are determined to squeeze the industry\u2019s prices and profits, and they have a stack of legislative proposals that could do so. Drug makers are quietly making contingency plans.\u201cAs the midterm elections approach, a feeling of foreboding has settled over the pharmaceutical industry,\u201d said John E. McManus, a Republican health care lobbyist whose clients include major drug companies, as well as their trade association, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.\u201cCombine the rising blue wave \u2014 the Democrat fixation on pharmaceutical pricing \u2014 with President Trump\u2019s populist focus on getting credit for cutting patients\u2019 drug costs, and the industry could be confronting a perfect storm in 2019,\u201d Mr. McManus said.Democrats\u2019 ideas include allowing Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices; putting a cap on Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 out-of-pocket drug costs; requiring manufacturers to disclose and justify any significant price increases; and outlawing tactics used by brand-name drug makers to delay the development and marketing of lower-cost versions of their products.If Democrats retake the House, the gavel of the Health Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee could go to Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas, an unyielding critic of what he calls price gouging by pharmaceutical companies.Pharmaceutical companies will be losing one of their most powerful allies, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and the chairman of the Finance Committee, who is retiring after more than 40 years in Congress.He is likely to be succeeded as chairman by Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who is more of a populist on health policy. In 2015, he and Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, issued a blistering report on their 18-month investigation of the high prices charged by Gilead Sciences for two hepatitis C drugs.Mr. Grassley has long supported allowing importation of prescription drugs from Canada \u2014 anathema to the industry. He wrote the provisions of federal law that require drug companies to disclose the payments they make to doctors for research, consulting, speaking, travel and entertainment. Mr. Grassley is also the foremost champion of whistle-blower laws, under which drug companies have paid billions of dollars to resolve allegations that they defrauded the government or engaged in illegal marketing practices.The challenges facing the industry were laid out in stark terms this month by Covington & Burling, a Washington law firm that has been advising pharmaceutical companies for more than 75 years.Rujul Desai, a lawyer, said in a webinar that the firm had done \u201cwar-gaming exercises\u201d with senior drug company executives to prepare them for possible congressional investigations and hearings on drug prices. The goal, he said, is to help clients \u201ccommunicate the value of their innovative medicines.\u201dOne of his colleagues at Covington, Jennifer L. Plitsch, explained how the government could try to use existing laws to force a reduction in the prices of drugs developed with the help of taxpayer funds.The government has rarely used this authority, Ms. Plitsch said, but that could change. \u201cIt is,\u201d she said, \u201ca very easy sound bite for price control advocates: Why should American taxpayers both contribute to drug development and then pay the highest prices in the world as patients?\u201dShe suggested how drug companies could answer that argument: \u201cThe sound bite is misleading and simplistic. The proposal would chill innovation and hurt patients. A vast majority of the investment in drug development comes from private industry, not the government.\u201dThe politics of drug prices cross party lines. Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, was among the first to praise Mr. Trump\u2019s plan to mandate the inclusion of drug prices in TV ads.Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, a liberal Democrat, said she was \u201csurprised and happy\u201d to receive a phone call from the Trump administration notifying her of its price-disclosure proposal, which resembles a bill she introduced in July.\u201cDespite their army of lobbyists,\u201d Ms. Schakowsky said, \u201cdrug companies should be very, very worried. Drug costs will be one of the first things on our agenda.\u201dAnother Democrat poised to pounce is Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who is in line to become chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform if Democrats take control of the House. In the last four years, he has aggressively investigated the industry, peppering drug makers and the Trump administration with numerous requests for information.Doctors, patients and insurers support many of the efforts to hold down drug costs. Researchers are making significant progress against cancer and other diseases, but \u201caccess is meaningless without affordability,\u201d said Dr. Victor J. Dzau, the president of the National Academy of Medicine.Mr. Trump\u2019s latest budget would provide Medicare beneficiaries with better protection against high drug costs by limiting their out-of-pocket expenses. Under another Trump proposal that could appeal to Democrats, Medicare beneficiaries would receive more of the savings that insurers extract from drug manufacturers.The Democrats\u2019 proposal for the government to negotiate drug prices for millions of Medicare patients is their preferred solution. But it would also face the most opposition, from drug makers and Republicans who see it as a step toward price controls.As he campaigned for the presidency, Mr. Trump said he would \u201cnegotiate like crazy\u201d to secure lower drug prices for Medicare. The idea \u2014 opposed by administration officials who have worked in the pharmaceutical industry \u2014 has dropped off his agenda.\u201cPresident Trump has seemingly abandoned his campaign promise to have Medicare negotiate like crazy,\u201d said Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader. But, she added, \u201cwe hope he would work with a Democratic majority to deliver on negotiation authority and lower drug prices.\u201dDrug companies seek to maintain their influence and access in the Capitol with campaign contributions and platoons of lobbyists recruited from both parties.The drug industry has contributed nearly $12 million to candidates in this year\u2019s congressional races, about 60 percent of it to Republicans, according to data compiled by Kaiser Health News. That sum is dwarfed by the $267 million that drug makers report having spent on lobbying in 2017-18, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks money in politics.\u201cDrug companies have been in such a strong position, and they have contributed so generously to people in both parties, they\u2019ve been pretty well able to block anything,\u201d Mr. Doggett said. \u201cBut I do believe that there is now a public outcry, a real pent-up demand, that we take action.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Project Baseline Aims to Ward Off Illness Before We Get Sick", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byResearchers are recruiting 10,000 volunteers to discover the earliest warning signs of cancer, heart disease and other killers.\u201cIn the cancer field we often find problems long after people have symptoms,\u201d he said. \u201cWe rarely find things early.\u201dMany of the people joining the study are healthy adults, which differs from traditional medical trials that focus largely on people who are already ill. Another key difference is that the researchers are collecting a staggering amount of medical data on their subjects: analyzing their microbiomes, sequencing their genomes, subjecting them to a variety of scans and assessing their cognitive health. They are also equipping volunteers with new wearable technology from Verily that records their nightly sleep patterns and tracks their heart rhythms and physical activity.In another unusual move, the Project Baseline investigators are sharing the research results with their subjects, everything from how much plaque or calcium they find in their arteries to which bacterial strains inhabit their guts. Some experts worry, however, that providing such detailed medical data to healthy adults could lead to new problems. Dr. Eric Topol, a professor of genomics at the Scripps Research Institute in California, cautioned that the sheer amount of testing, scans and other \u201cdeep interrogations\u201d could produce incidental findings that cause unnecessary anxiety. \u201cSometimes it leads to unwarranted further testing that could even be harmful,\u201d he said.\u201cThis is the new challenge in a democratized world of medical research,\u201d Dr. Topol said. \u201cI\u2019m really in favor of it, but it sets up this new issue of dealing with unexpected results that are difficult to interpret.\u201dThe Project Baseline researchers are learning this firsthand. They say they have discovered and promptly alerted participants to potentially lethal conditions that might otherwise have gone unnoticed, like cancer and aortic aneurysms, so they can seek appropriate medical care. But some of the participants have also been frightened by fairly innocuous findings, like chest X-rays that reveal small, usually benign nodules in their lungs that they may look up on the internet and think are cancerous, said Dr. Charlene Wong, a Project Baseline investigator. \u201cFor most of our participants, it will not be cancer. But we\u2019re still in the process of working with participants to find out if we can return that data in the right way so that we minimize the anxiety it can cause,\u201d she said.Dr. Ken Mahaffey, a Project Baseline investigator and cardiologist at Stanford, said that he and his colleagues have \u201ca responsibility, socially, morally and ethically, to get systems in place so we can share the results with participants in ways that they can understand them and then help them engage with their own physicians and clinical providers.\u201dDespite the anxiety it can cause, many people welcome such data. Studies like Project Baseline are especially appealing to the so-called Quantified Self movement, the growing community of people who track their every biometric with smartphone apps, high-tech gadgets and direct-to-consumer health tests. Some 2,000 people have enrolled in Project Baseline so far, and thousands more have signed up in a registry of potential volunteers who may be called on as the project expands to additional medical centers. While there have been plenty of longitudinal studies in the past, many of the largest and most important were not very diverse. The landmark Framingham heart study that began in 1948, for example, focused mostly on white adults. Dr. Svati Shah, an associate professor of medicine at Duke, said Project Baseline is recruiting many people who are black, Hispanic, Asian and other ethnicities so the study can shed light on differences in disease risk factors among people of different backgrounds.That includes people like Rosa Gonzalez, 57, a nurse who lives in Concord, N.C. Ms. Gonzalez, who is Mexican-American, joined the study earlier this year and has encouraged at least a dozen Latino friends and acquaintances to join it as well. \u201cOther studies present data and talk about Latinos, but they don\u2019t have Latinos in the study,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to set an example so other Latinos see that it\u2019s good to take part so that we can have data that shows how we\u2019re the same or different.\u201dDr. Gambhir said the idea for Project Baseline was hatched in 2013, when Google executives approached him and said they wanted to do a landmark study on human health. Dr. Gambhir proposed a study to find early markers of cancer in people who are otherwise healthy. \u201cWe have always thought that if we learn more about what your body is doing before you become ill, then we would have a much better chance of ideally preventing or at least detecting things early,\u201d he said. Google liked the idea but suggested broadening the scope to include other diseases.Verily declined to say how much it is spending on Project Baseline. But the company is investing in several areas of health care, including the development of contact lenses and miniature sensors that monitor blood sugar levels so patients with diabetes can better manage their disease. In addition to sharing results with study volunteers, Project Baseline is hosting events and webinars in which study participants can ask the researchers questions and give them suggestions. \u201cThis isn\u2019t research that\u2019s happening in a black box,\u201d said Dr. Jessica Mega, Verily\u2019s chief medical officer. \u201cPeople on the ground are part of this movement.\u201dWondering what you should be wondering about in terms of your health?

Cheer You Up", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "FeatureThe dynamic star is trying to keep comedy alive at a moment when Hollywood \u2014 and its audience \u2014 can\u2019t seem to crack a smile.Supported byOriginally, we were scheduled to go to a rage room, which, I think, is a place where you can beat things to death in a disturbing, passive-aggressive cry for help. Neither of us had ever been to one, but honestly, by the time it was suggested to me, it sounded like the cure of and for the century. I\u2019ll probably never know. The local rage room was open for only 15 minutes on a Thursday, which we all found strange because, considering the state of the world, a rage room should maybe be open around the clock as a public service. (\u201cYou need to have them like Starbucks,\u201d McCarthy told me later.)Her publicist tried, but ultimately the rage room wouldn\u2019t open early, not even for Melissa McCarthy, and she called to tell me that we would be changing to indoor sky diving at the iFly at Universal Studios. \u201cI hope you see the metaphor here,\u201d her publicist said to me. \u201cShe\u2019s flying, she\u2019s up high, she\u2019s soaring.\u201d I nodded and dutifully wrote this down.McCarthy arrived. She\u2019s tiny, just 5-foot-2, and her face is a shiny, magnetic sparkle \u2014 its resting expression is cheerfulness, its cheeks are dimpled, its inquisitiveness is somehow loving. It draws people energetically near it so that when people passed her on Universal City Walk, something forces them to turn toward her, having no idea why, only to then find out that she actually was the actress Melissa McCarthy. She is prone to wide-eyed expressions of surprise; she is prone to making her mouth as round as her eyes as she listens in awe or surprise or delight. It\u2019s a staple of some of her Midwestern-seeming characters, a delighted incredulity when faced with the modern world.A tall, athletic man who worked for iFly led us to change into purple jumpsuits that were made out of some environment-defiant mixture of nylon and other proprietary materials and forced us to watch an instructional video about all the safety and fun we were going to have. McCarthy was excited. I tried to be, too, but truthfully, I was still kind of bummed. A rage room! I could really find my way through a rage metaphor right now. I asked her why she wanted to do it in the first place. Was she as angry as the rest of us? She said it sounded fun. I asked her how she chose indoor sky diving as a runner-up. Was she ready to jet off and leave this earth and colonize another planet and start over like the rest of us? No, she said. The rage room was closed and this also sounded fun. I blinked.I sat on deck, watching her take her turn. It had been a long time since I\u2019d participated in an overt magazine stunt whose purpose was to set a scene for the opening paragraph of a story, to crystallize and illuminate a person for the reader and create a metaphor through which to weave a story \u2014 it\u2019s just not done anymore. And I didn\u2019t want to waste time flying just because it\u2019s fun when we had a lot to talk about: The way the world has changed comedy, the grave wounds that make somebody go into this weird profession.I looked from my notebook to the tube to my notebook to the tube, and yeah, I guess she was flying, she was up high, she was soaring. Then I noticed her face beneath her helmet: Her mouth and eyes open as round as her dimples, her face an expression of unmitigated wonder and joy, and there beyond the glass, I noticed for the first time just what a good time she seemed to be having.It was the \u201980s or maybe it was Lee Israel herself. Israel wrote biographies about celebrities but couldn\u2019t support herself, so she began forging letters in the voices of celebrities, a kind of fan fiction that allowed her work to finally be something it never was, which was valued. McCarthy was drawn to a character so different from herself: \u201cTalk about conflicted and challenging,\u201d she said. \u201cTalk about someone who is not trying to be likable at all.\u201d The more McCarthy dug into her, the more she began to really understand how isolated Israel was. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a bit obsessed with someone who is in the middle of such a huge city with so many people and yet is alone. And chooses to be alone! And puts herself in positions to not make new acquaintances, to not meet people.\u201d Israel would go to gay bars, during a time when gay bars were just for gay men, and drink in a corner with her headphones on so that no one would talk to her.[Review: Melissa McCarthy is criminally good in \u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d]Consider the outtake from \u201cThis Is Forty\u201d in which McCarthy berates every person in the room. \u201cI\u2019m going to light you all on fire.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m glad your husband died.\u201d When asked if she has been drinking: \u201cI\u2019m gonna slit somebody open like a fish and drink their blood. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to drink.\u201d As she went, Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann laugh too visibly and too loudly for any of the film to be usable, but McCarthy keeps going. Judd Apatow, the movie\u2019s director, couldn\u2019t use it because of the laughter, but he also couldn\u2019t allow it to be lost to legend and so he ran it during the movie\u2019s credits. Everyone, including McCarthy, knew in the moment that it wasn\u2019t going to make it into the movie. She didn\u2019t care. She was making people laugh.It\u2019s strange to watch that now, just a scene of a person riffing for pure enjoyment. Comedy has changed so much since then; it has become unrecognizable since I first began interviewing her in 2016. It has gone from being a variety of ways to tickle a person \u2014 real life, funny because it\u2019s true, ironic funny, deadpan funny, parody funny, no-duh funny, slapstick, farce, absurdity, pratfalls, a real variety \u2014 to merely, glumly reflecting what a terrible world this has become. It is purely reactive. It is completely tethered to world events. For example, a few years ago, \u201cColbert\u201d was flailing, trying to find its footing. But the recent saturation of bad news (or the news producer they hired from \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d or both) made it a hit.\u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d is her third movie this year. The others, \u201cLife of the Party\u201d and \u201cThe Happytime Murders,\u201d were comedies and were not quite so adored. She read those reviews, too. She reads all kinds of movie reviews. She sees that when a drama doesn\u2019t work, it was \u201ca good effort\u201d and gets a thoughtful review, but when a comedy doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s a crime against humanity and gets taken outside behind the shed. And shot. And then burned. And then the ashes are put up on a scaffold so that future generations of filmmakers can choose never to dare. She worries that that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen \u2014 that if this keeps up, if no one can find the value in just plain comedy, there will be no discernible demand and then they won\u2019t get made and fast forward millions of years and all that will be left are Marvel movies, Mad Max video games and those jumpsuits we wore at the iFly.Critics never loved comedies, not even in her most beloved era, the \u201980s, but those movies could still get audiences; those movies could still be financed. Now audiences have access to Rotten Tomatoes ratings and every single review from every single paper; it is hard to come back from overwhelmingly negative critical consensus. Put it this way: Twenty years ago, there were three pure comedies in the Top 10 highest-grossing movies of the year. This year, so far, there are zero.She worries about comedy. She worries about the gloom and fatigue that flows beneath the streets, waiting to suck away her will to laugh and to make laughter. In 2013, she and Falcone, created their production company, On the Day Productions, which allows them to make their movies on their terms, with their own comic tastes. They keep their costs down, making movies like \u201cLife of the Party\u201d and \u201cThe Boss\u201d and next year\u2019s \u201cSuperintelligence\u201d in Atlanta for an audience they know still exists. They keep their sets closed and tight and full of only people they know and trust. Some people call their movies failures because they\u2019re not critically beloved, but they mostly break even during their opening weekends. They still make millions and millions of dollars \u2014 and keep her among Hollywood\u2019s highest-paid actresses \u2014 and offer a 90-minute refuge for a whole lot of people, so exactly which part of it is a failure?\u201cWe\u2019re in a lot of trouble if it all becomes cops and capes and horror and grim,\u201d she said. At night, she and Falcone, who directed \u201cLife of the Party,\u201d \u201cTammy\u201d and \u201cThe Boss,\u201d sit in what they call their old-people chairs with glasses of Scotch and talk about whether comedy can be saved. Falcone worries that the world and the movies the world wants to see are getting darker and darker and darker because the spectrum of human awareness has widened and the mood has dampened and we\u2019ve taken the movies down with us. But darkness should make you seek out comedy even more, shouldn\u2019t it? It used to. \u201cIt\u2019s why they make comedies after the war,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cYou need to see the human experience, and you need to be able to laugh at yourself instead of just making fun of other people. I\u2019m not saying what we do is so important, but it\u2019s a little stupid thing that maybe can take some of the tension off.\u201d Here she thinks about Lee Israel again. She thinks about how people protect themselves from the world.She makes coffee, and she does not turn on the news; she does not check her email; she does not do Transcendental Meditation. She watches TV \u2014 \u201cI treat myself right,\u201d she says \u2014 an old episode of \u201cKnight Rider,\u201d which she thinks everyone should be rewatching, or the original episodes of \u201cThe Incredible Hulk.\u201d\u201cI watch Lou Ferrigno freak out, throw a clearly rubber tree. Bill Bixby\u2019s high-waisted super chambray-colored pants. They\u2019re always so pristine. Even though he\u2019s backpacking in the woods, he\u2019s so freshly laundered. I had no memory of the softer side of the Hulk. Lou Ferrigno, as the Hulk, picked up a baby bird\u2019s nest \u2014 or did he pick up actual baby birds? I can\u2019t remember which. I was like: \u2018You\u2019re not supposed to touch a baby bird and put them back in a tree. They\u2019d die and then their mother would leave them.\u2019 Is that true? If you touch a bird does the mother really take off? That\u2019s what we were always told, right?\u201d Back to the Hulk. \u201cIt\u2019s great. The music. There\u2019s. So. Much. Score.\u201dAfter her episode, she invites the world into her home, but reluctantly, but carefully, but slowly. She walks outside to get The Los Angeles Times, whose print edition is delivered to her doorstep. She reads The New York Times on her iPad. But then she turns to her National Geographic, which she also has delivered. You have to look at the photos in print to really get it \u2014 a toucan, a polar bear. She looks at Nat Geo and she looks at The Times and she can\u2019t reconcile it. Everyone\u2019s talking about borders lately. They should be talking about this stuff. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about polar bears and the toucan because it\u2019s so random and someone is taking these beautiful pictures. That\u2019s what the world is. It\u2019s not borders. Of course, it\u2019s all that, too, but, like, let\u2019s also remember how amazing the whole planet is.\u201dOn weekends, she and Falcone put their phones away for the duration. On Sundays, they gather their friends they have been working with since the Groundlings improv school \u2014 since forever \u2014 to their home for dinner. Falcone makes meatballs and sauce or McCarthy makes meatloaf. Sometimes Falcone and Steve Mallory, their old Groundlings friend and frequent co-writer and co-star, grill steaks. McCarthy and Falcone talk to each other lovingly, doing different characters and little voices that they\u2019ve developed over time, each with its own pace and energy and voice, moving in and out of them with no transition as if they\u2019re additional guests in their home just inhabiting their bodies. Mallory says she will one minute be a tough-talking Midwestern person, and then in a second she\u2019ll be a too-literal scientist, and then she\u2019ll turn into cross-eyed, pageboyed Marbles, this character she has had forever that talks real loopy.She hates how the entire world is set up to make people more efficient. She hates the trend that every home needs an open-concept design of one room leading to another. She sees what it\u2019s really about, which is not you spending time with your kids while you cook and they watch TV but you being able to be everywhere at once. \u201cWe are literally knocking down walls to help ourselves multitask,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll start a business called \u2018Walls,\u2019 and my specialty will be putting walls in, because in 10 years we\u2019re all going to want them again because we\u2019ve made our houses into studio apartments.\u201d She puts her hands to her mouth as if she\u2019s hollering: \u201c\u2009\u2018The bed\u2019s in the kitchen!\u2019\u2009\u201dAt night, while she takes a bath, her iPad comes out. She could spend hours there on Pinterest or on Etsy. She buys bullheads and wallpaper and Moroccan rugs and duck heads and a moose head. She buys a bunch of 1980s-style dresses from an Etsy shop owned by woman in New Mexico for the \u201980s-themed party scene in \u201cLife of the Party.\u201d She orders these things under a different name but she also wants to call the woman and say: \u201cYour dresses are in my movie! Thank you for the dresses! Go see the movie!\u201dThe sets, particularly the ones on which Falcone is directing, look the same again and again because they\u2019re populated by people who have known one another, some of them as far back as the Groundlings. On this one: Matt Walsh, who was also in \u201cGhostbusters\u201d with McCarthy, now playing her husband. Mallory, who wrote \u201cThe Boss\u201d and appeared in \u201cTammy\u201d and \u201cIdentity Thief\u201d and whom McCarthy and Falcone had invited as a guest writer to sharpen the day\u2019s dialogue. Damon Jones, who also appeared in both of those movies. Maya Rudolph, who has been in just about everything with her.The crew is mostly the same, too. There\u2019s Pamela the makeup artist, who has been with her forever. There\u2019s Sheila, the script supervisor going all the way back to \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d who tells stories about the nervous breakdown she almost had trying to keep track of all the ad-libbing in the Brazilian-restaurant scene. McCarthy and Falcone think they\u2019re going to use this new assistant director again. Once they find someone, they tend to keep her around. They do what they call \u201ccrazy checks\u201d on the people they hire. McCarthy, or a proxy, calls around and wants to know: Do they at some point freak out and lose their temper and yell at people? Are they nice? Are they nice even when certain people aren\u2019t around? People talking to extras disrespectfully makes her \u201cblood cold.\u201dWhen she was training at the Groundlings, she was taught the improv rules, to say \u201cYes and\u201d and \u201cWhy not?\u201d ad infinitum until you land at the most extreme and funniest state of play. When she\u2019s in front of these people, she finds it easier to do that, to take it 10 levels further than a regular comedian would. The freedom and comfort allows her to strip away the natural human vanity that undermines comedy as she tries out new lines and bombs incessantly. \u201cVanity,\u201d she told me, \u201cis a huge waste of time and you never get good work that way.\u201d Magic happens when you bomb so much. She learned that in the Groundlings, too. \u201cYou try 20 to get one.\u201d It allows her to be ornery and vulnerable in \u201cThe Heat.\u201d It allows her to be cantankerous and lost in \u201cTammy.\u201d It allows her to be bombastic and desperate in \u201cThe Boss.\u201dThe few rules on set are strict ones. The main one is: be present, which translates into people only using their phones for direct, necessary communication. Phones drive McCarthy crazy, so the rule is that you can use your phone if you need to, but no scrolling. If you\u2019re scrolling, you\u2019re not actually checking anything. You\u2019re checking on your 15th cousin. \u201cYou\u2019re absent-mindedly removing yourself from the space you are in,\u201d she says.She sees why phones are necessary, she accepts their existence, but she thinks the world got much worse and more apathetic and less willing to say \u201cYes and\u201d and \u201cWhy not?\u201d the minute everyone had a smartphone. She\u2019ll post on Instagram but she won\u2019t read Instagram. She won\u2019t even do email. People can text her or they can call her. Email will drown her. The return lobs will necessitate checking for yet another answer, and who knows when that will come \u2014 when she\u2019s sitting down for dinner with her daughters? When she\u2019s writing with Falcone? When she\u2019s about to think of something really funny or new or interesting?She wants her set to be safe from this. She wants it to be a place where conversations can get weird: \u201cDo you know so-and-so has a sixth toe?\u201d is her example of a weird turn in a conversation. She wants to know fun facts. She wants to know where people grew up. Or:\u201cNot that I want to wear pantyhose,\u201d she was saying. She was in full camera makeup and wore fake eyelashes that made her eyes even greener. \u201cBut, God, if I did I would want to just crack open a L\u2019eggs. Who thought of that? Who was like: \u2018We should put pantyhose in a chicken egg. They love wearing pantyhose, and they love large chicken eggs.\u2019 At some point, somebody was sitting around holding a bourbon and said: \u2018Women love eggs. You know why.\u2019\u2009\u201d She held a pretend bourbon in her hand and put the emphasis on the why but never stopped smiling.\u201cGuys,\u201d she said. When she speaks, she is soft and kind. She does not suck the life force out of everything she comes in contact with, unlike other funny people I\u2019ve interviewed. \u201cI think we\u2019ve cracked the code on why L\u2019eggs pantyhose used to come in an egg. We have to look up when that was started, but the theory is, which I\u2019m horrified is right, is because somebody said, \u2018Women have eggs, they love pantyhose, let\u2019s put them together!\u2019\u2009\u201dA crowd had gathered, and everyone was laughing \u2014 Ben, Maya, Steve, Matt, Pamela, Sheila, the producer Chris Henchy. They were running ahead of schedule. The days have been long on this one, but nothing crazy. Everyone agrees nothing crazy.See? You can\u2019t have a conversation like that when everyone\u2019s scrolling on their phones.McCarthy wanted to be wild, too. She was always trying characters on. She was a cheerleader one year, the next a Goth with black lipstick and bangs who wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone. She went to Catholic school for 12 years and wore a uniform but would say, \u201cKnee down and neck up is mine.\u201d She had friends. She was on the student council. She played tennis. But then she would dye her hair blue-black and wear Kabuki makeup and full-length capes. That wasn\u2019t teenage moodiness. There was no real darkness behind it. What can she say? She lived in a small town. She was bored. \u201cEveryone was wearing the same sweater from the Limited, and I could go to the thrift store and find an entire, full-blown costume for the same price.\u201d Her boyfriend wore a magician\u2019s hat and cape and spats to prom, along with what she called a \u201cPuttin\u2019 on the Ritz\u201d cane.She cultivated characters that were the opposite of her real self, all of them designed to make people laugh. Most of them were old because what\u2019s more opposite a 20-year-old than an 80-year-old? She grew up with her great-grandmother. One of her first jobs in fourth grade was as a caretaker for her 93-year-old Aunt Hilda. McCarthy would go to her house after school and make her a snack and hang out while McCarthy\u2019s mom cleaned downstairs. Her first real job was at a nursing home. She began to collect wigs (not from the nursing home), one to bring each of her elderly or societally fringe characters to life.She said she was never trying to escape herself. It wasn\u2019t like that at all. She had no emotional need beyond wondering what it was like to be these particular characters. The first time she did standup, she wore a giant wig. \u201cI like me,\u201d she said. This was over the summer, when we met at a hotel off Fifth Avenue and she was wearing a beanie, a pink cat T-shirt and a cross-body cellphone carrier. \u201cBut I am me.\u201d She doesn\u2019t even really understand my questions about what kind of loneliness makes a person go into her line of work. How can she tell you if she felt rejected for not being someone wearing the same Limited sweater everyone else was wearing when she doesn\u2019t even understand why you would want to wear the same clothes as everyone else in the first place?People don\u2019t really get her. They want to know her philosophy, her feelings on irony, how she does it. Falcone told me that everyone always wants to know what big secret she\u2019s keeping. \u201cI think people, in the effort to keep things poppy, don\u2019t look and see that while she\u2019s incredibly kind and Midwestern and gentle, she\u2019s also really complicated as a human, as we all are,\u201d Falcone told me. \u201cI think what people are missing is the fact that she\u2019s pretty, she\u2019s funny, she\u2019s smart. She also doesn\u2019t take [expletive]. She\u2019s told all the time, \u2018You can\u2019t do this or that in the acting world.\u2019 But she says, \u2018Why not\u2019 and \u2018Yes and\u2019 all the time, which I think is a hallmark of crazy people but also people that are successful.\u201dIn her bath, McCarthy thinks about originality. She thinks about the movies she grew up watching and how she waited for the day when she would finally be able to do that.By the time we sat down at that hotel, \u201cLife of the Party\u201d had come and gone. Critics called it \u201cthe latest Melissa McCarthy star vehicle that fails to do justice to the sheer awesomeness of its leading lady\u201d (RogerEbert.com) and said she \u201cfalls into the same trap she did in \u2018Tammy\u2019 and \u2018The Boss,\u2019 the two other movies she wrote with her husband/director Ben Falcone. By that we mean she allows her laugh instincts to get buried in a blanket of bland\u201d (Rolling Stone). \u201cLooking for something fun to take Mom to for Mother\u2019s Day? Do your mom (and yourself) a favor and steer clear of \u2018Life of the Party\u2019\u2009\u201d (ibid.).Critics say her comedies are just sanitized versions of a time she\u2019s nostalgic for. But the thing that keeps her making the kind of movies she and Falcone make isn\u2019t nostalgia. It\u2019s just that that\u2019s just the last time comedy was allowed to be a random assortment of things to make you laugh. It\u2019s her refusal to let the state of the world come and take comedy along with it. After \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d the media called her an overnight success, even though she was past 40 and had, by that time, \u201cworked like an animal\u201d for decades. All these years and all this hard work and she finally got to Wally World. But what happens when you get to Wally World and you find out it\u2019s closed?In their chairs, Falcone says maybe we\u2019re already too lost. McCarthy says, \u201cYeah, but what if?\u201dThe movie, which was directed by Brian Henson, Jim Henson\u2019s son, is a comedy that\u2019s maybe also a race allegory between puppets and humans? I couldn\u2019t quite tell. The resolution of the mystery at the heart of it involves \u2014 I hope I\u2019m beyond the statute of limitations with this crucial spoiler \u2014 a puppet\u2019s pubic hair not being the same color as the hair on her puppet head. This is perhaps the least obscene detail in the entire film.\u201cThe Happytime Murders\u201d came out under the cover of late August with a small scandal attached to it. (\u201cSesame Street\u201d was upset.) A few critics called it the worst movie of the year. It was called \u201ctired, bloodless stuff\u201d (The Times). Elsewhere it was said that \u201cthis R-rated look at a serial killer running wild in a puppet-populated L.A., has what it takes to be a contender for worst of the decade\u201d (Rolling Stone). They said it was \u201cbasically, disgusting\u201d and \u201creprehensible\u201d (The New Yorker) and \u201ca joyless, soulless slog\u201d (Slate).Honestly, it wasn\u2019t that bad. The novelty of puppets ejaculating in a movie after a lifetime of indoctrination to \u201cSesame Street\u201d characters does not go stale after 91 minutes. Best of all, it is the dirty, cursing, obscene version of McCarthy, which is my favorite. Her character gets a liver replacement using a puppet liver and she becomes prone to the ailments of the puppets (including a glucose-snorting-through-licorice-straws addiction). Whatever Freudian issues young Henson was trying to work out, there are some laughs in there \u2014 real, full-body ones that remind you that laughter is actually a bodily response to something new and sometimes a little surprising. It happened during a scene when one of the characters watches an octopus/cow porn shoot that consists of the octopus milking the cow lasciviously. My breath spurt out like little gasps and my body spasmed in time with them. It seemed like a cough at first, as if maybe my body was expelling something? Or maybe I was sobbing unwittingly? Was I dry-heaving? I thought, What the hell is happening here? What is this thing happening to my body? But it was pleasurable. It forced my body to course \u2014 briefly, very briefly \u2014 with something that felt like well-being.She\u2019s right. You forget all this when you don\u2019t go to the movies. You forget how much your experience of a comedy depends on your being in a room full of people who are not just also laughing, but who also came just so they could laugh \u2014 even though in my screening it was just those two other people. There is something poignant about the act of entering the theater to laugh; there is something that feels revolutionary about it.Comedy changes. Comedy has changed. I finally watched the comedy special people keep recommending to me, \u201cNanette,\u201d and it\u2019s O.K.-funny, sure, but it\u2019s so relevant and so about the problems of the world that it feels more like a humorous TED Talk than a comedy special. \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d and \u201cColbert\u201d and \u201cSamantha Bee\u201d are the open-concept homes of efficiency where you can get your comedy, your information and your outrage all from one source \u2014 things that used to be sold separately. The only time I laughed this week was during the day when my favorite Twitter feed, @_FloridaMan, tweeted out video of some idiot jet skiing down a highway that\u2019s an actual news clip from real life. I can barely make it through the cold open of \u201cS.N.L.,\u201d it\u2019s so depressing.McCarthy has created her own world time and again \u2014 at home and on set and in her childhood. And yes, bubbles don\u2019t just keep things in; they keep things out, too. They keep out input and challenges, and sometimes they even keep out change. But what if it\u2019s valid to not want to change? What if it\u2019s valid to keep misery at bay?I don\u2019t have any bubbles anymore; nobody I know does, either. There was a story in the paper about a guy who doesn\u2019t read the news and people\u2019s faces melted off. Everyone I know has become political. My Facebook feed is a nightmare of radicalized everyone and fighting all the time and stupid JPGs with angry aphorisms and petitions. I\u2019ve become someone who uses the word \u201crevolutionary\u201d to describe being in a movie theater. I wrote this story six times, and each time it was returned to me as too depressing and listless. I tried to figure out how to make it work \u2014 a Melissa McCarthy article should probably not be depressing, I agreed \u2014 and my editor gave me some suggestions, but I couldn\u2019t hear him above the TVs in our newsroom, which all blared detailed accounts of sexual assault and miscarriages of justice and a climate-change story that said we would all be desiccated human Slim Jim husks of ourselves, withered by the parching sun in 20 years and outrage outrage outrage until we are limp and exhausted and miserable.What I\u2019m saying is that maybe McCarthy is onto something. Why stay out here when it is so much nicer in there, behind the gates with the resin zoo and the old \u201cHulk\u201d episodes? Why look for meaning in everything when the entire point of the comedy exercise is to transcend meaning and responsibility and poignancy? She\u2019s funny. She\u2019s polar bears and toucans. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s what she aspires to. Take it or leave it, but please don\u2019t leave it because it has taken me this long to recognize it and that\u2019s not great. What I\u2019m saying is that maybe we should consider trying this her way. So:McCarthy was flying, she was way up high, she was soaring. She was hovering six feet above Los Angeles, her body and soul and her essence and her gifts protected by a glass tube (was the glass tube the point this whole time?), wearing a purple jumpsuit made out of some environment-defiant mixture of nylon and other proprietary materials and a helmet and goggles. Her limbs were spread out like a starfish, with her legs bent at the knee as if she were a teenager reading on her stomach on her bed and her arms bent at the elbow so that had she been upright, they would have made the shape of a cactus.Six feet is not so far up, but it is far enough away from us to see us but not catch our ills of gloom and despondence. During her last turn, the wind was kicked up and she was sent way, way up, to the top of the tube, so that she was even higher and had even more distance. I looked at her face, with its wonder. There she was \u2014 her mouth and eyes were round like her dimples in an expression of unmitigated wonder and joy. There she was, up in the air, high above everyone, yelling to me that I just had to try it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Law Firm\u2019s Fee Settlement Could Shake Up Securities Class Actions", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA deal that was reached this week in a long-running fee dispute has the potential to reshape the way law firms that represent plaintiffs bill for their work and pay other lawyers for referring clients to them.The proposed settlement could prompt greater transparency about so-called finder fees that are paid to lawyers \u2014 especially those who do little actual work in a matter. It was agreed to late Tuesday by Labaton Sucharow, a well-known class action securities law firm.Under the settlement, which requires approval by a federal judge in Boston, Labaton would have to cough up $4.8 million in fees it collected, splitting the money between the plaintiffs and some of the other firms involved in the case. It must also retain a former federal judge to make sure its fee-sharing arrangements with other lawyers \u201care in compliance with applicable rules and emerging best practices.\u201dIt is not uncommon for law firms like Labaton, which has achieved significant settlements in securities cases involving Facebook, the Brazilian petroleum giant Petrobras and the mining company Barrick Gold, to pay referral fees to lawyers who bring them clients. But typically, the lawyers are expected to have done some work to justify a significant fee. It is considered good legal practice for such arrangements to be disclosed to all parties in the lawsuit \u2014 something the Labaton firm did not do in this litigation.John Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School who specializes in securities law, said the case had shed an important light on the \u201crather sordid market of buying and selling plaintiffs\u201d in securities class actions.\u201cI think the whole arrangement was under the table and dubious,\u201d Mr. Coffee said.In a statement, Labaton acknowledged that its disclosure about the finder\u2019s fee \u201cfell short of emerging best practices.\u201d The firm, in a court filing that accompanied the proposed settlement, said it \u201caccepts responsibility\u201d for that shortcoming.Judge Mark L. Wolf of Federal District Court in Boston is expected to hold a hearing on the proposed agreement on Monday. A spokesman for the firm said Larry Sucharow, its chairman, would attend the hearing and \u201cbe prepared to address any questions the court may have regarding the proposed agreement.\u201dThe dispute over lawyers\u2019 fees erupted in 2016, not long after Labaton secured a $300 million settlement from State Street, a Boston financial services company, in a securities class-action lawsuit concerning transaction fees charged on foreign currency trades.In March 2017, the judge appointed a special master \u2014 the former federal judge Gerald E. Rosen \u2014 to look into the appropriateness of the fee package, including the issues of double-counting attorney hours spent on the case and the reasonableness of the rates charged by the lawyers. But during a 14-month investigation, Mr. Rosen made a startling discovery: Labaton had paid a lawyer in Texas a finder\u2019s fee equal to 20 percent of the attorneys\u2019 fee it received in the litigation.The payment to the lawyer, Damon Chargois, had not been previously disclosed. Mr. Rosen\u2019s investigation unearthed documents showing that Mr. Chargois did no work on the litigation other than help introduce the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System to Labaton roughly a decade ago. In 2011, Labaton filed a lawsuit for the retirement fund that was later consolidated with similar lawsuits filed by a few other law firms.None of those other law firms, nor Judge Wolf, were aware of the payment to Mr. Chargois. The Arkansas retirement fund also was unaware of any fee arrangement.The discovery of the undisclosed referral fee was a focus of a blistering 377-page report that Mr. Rosen filed in federal court in June. He sharply criticized the Labaton firm for not disclosing the referral fee and said it \u201craises serious questions regarding class action attorneys\u2019 ethical and legal obligations to clients and co-counsel, as well as considerable concerns about how judges can fulfill their essential fiduciary obligations to the class.\u201dAs part of the settlement this week, Labaton agreed to return $4.8 million to resolve the finder\u2019s fee and double-billing matters. Labaton and another law firm also agreed to pay $3.8 million for the cost of the special master\u2019s investigation.Mr. Coffee, the Columbia professor, said judges should be more aggressive in asking law firms to disclose any finder-fee arrangements at the outset of a class action, rather than after the case has been resolved and the bills are to be paid.Such arrangements are necessary information for the plaintiffs and the judge to make informed decisions during the case, Mr. Coffee said. \u201cThis should not just happen at the fee award stage,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Ads From Unknown Backer Take Aim at Brexit Plan", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May has struggled to build support for her plan for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Now, it turns out, some of the opposition has come from an unknown organization posting ads to millions of people on Facebook.In the past 10 months, the organization spent more than 250,000 pounds on ads pushing for a more severe break from the European Union than Mrs. May has planned. The ads reached 10 million to 11 million people, according to a report published on Saturday by a House of Commons committee investigating the manipulation of social media in elections.The ads, which disappeared suddenly this week, linked to websites for people to send prewritten emails to their local member of Parliament outlining their opposition to Mrs. May\u2019s negotiations with the European Union.\u201cWe voted to leave the E.U., to take back control of our money and borders,\u201d one ad said.Who was behind the campaign remains a mystery. The name attached to it was Mainstream Network, a group that does not appear to exist in Britain, beyond the ads and a website. There is no information on Facebook or on Mainstream Network\u2019s site about who is behind the organization.The parliamentary panel, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said the posts highlighted Facebook\u2019s continuing problem monitoring political advertising on its social network.\u201cHere we have an example of a clearly sophisticated organization spending lots of money on a political campaign, and we have absolutely no idea who is behind it,\u201d Damian Collins, the chairman of committee, said in a statement. \u201cThe only people who know who is paying for these adverts is Facebook.\u201dThe panel has been investigating the role of social media in elections, including Facebook\u2019s influence on the country\u2019s contentious 2016 vote to leave the European Union. It is expected to release a full report in the coming weeks.Rob Leathern, director of product management at Facebook, said the company will update its disclosure policy in Britain next month. It will require political advertisers to verify their identities and then attach accurate information about their identities to the ads.\u201cWe know we can\u2019t prevent election interference alone,\u201d Mr. Leathern said, \u201cand offering more ad transparency allows journalists, researchers and other interested parties to raise important questions.\u201dTo oversee its response to a growing number of regulatory challenges around the world, the company announced on Friday that Nick Clegg, a former deputy prime minister in Britain who is politically well connected in Europe, would become its new head of global public policy.The Mainstream Network ads were taken down after Facebook announced its new political advertising rules in Britain, said Mike Harris, the chief executive of 89up, a social media marketing company that the parliamentary committee hired to help with its investigation.Mr. Harris, who specializes in political campaigns, discovered the ads recently when one popped up in his social media feed. His company, which has also done work for groups in favor of remaining in the European Union, found more than 70 ads posted over a 10-month period.The group behind the ads appears to be well funded. Based on what comparable political Facebook ad campaigns cost in the country, 89up estimated Mainstream Network spent \u00a3257,000, or about $335,000. Mainstream Network also maintains a polished website that mixes commentary favoring a hard break from the European Union, alongside straighter coverage of events such as Amazon\u2019s announcement that it will add jobs in Britain.Mainstream Network doesn\u2019t give any clue of who is publishing the content. No contact information is listed on its website or Facebook page.\u201cThere is no indication of who\u2019s behind it, or who\u2019s backing it,\u201d Mr. Harris said in an interview. \u201cThis could be a wealthy individual, this could be a group of volunteers that has come together that decided to hide its identity, or it could be a foreign state. It\u2019s totally unclear.\u201dThe ads were disclosed at a politically fragile time in Britain, where Mrs. May is trying to balance the position of those who want to retain closer ties to the Continent against those who want a harder break.Mainstream Network\u2019s ads have strongly targeted Mrs. May\u2019s central negotiating position, known as the \u201cChequers plan,\u201d which would maintain a tight trading relationship with Europe. Two members of her cabinet resigned over her approach.Pro-Brexit hard-liners want her to scrap the plan and propose a more distant relationship, like the European Union\u2019s trade agreement with Canada.The disclosures released on Saturday are a prelude to other investigations into online misinformation scheduled to be released by the end of the year. In addition to the parliamentary committee\u2019s final report, highly anticipated findings are expected from the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office after its investigation of Cambridge Analytica, the London-based political targeting firm that harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users.Stephen Castle contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is a Slowdown in Bank Lending a Bad Sign for the Economy?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySomething is afoot in the world of banking that suggests the economy is not as strong as it looks.Four of the United States\u2019 largest banks on Friday reported third-quarter results that, for the most part, exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations.But a worrisome trend again showed up in their numbers: The banks were not lending at the same rate that they had in recent years. While the economy can grow without strong lending, it may struggle to maintain its strength if loan growth remains lackluster.In the third quarter, the combined loans of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial Services increased just 2 percent from a year earlier, in line with the second-quarter rate. Last year, loans at the four banks grew 2.9 percent, and in 2016 and 2015 the rate was well above 4 percent.Though third-quarter loan growth was subpar, the tax cuts enacted at the end of last year continued to lift bank profits, and rising interest rates are helping banks earn more on their loans. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings surged 24 percent. Wells Fargo, still under regulatory scrutiny after a series of scandals, posted a 32 percent rise in net income, helped, in part, by a decline in costs. Citigroup\u2019s profits were up 12 percent.Earnings at PNC were solidly higher, but its sluggish lending helped send its stock down over 5 percent on Friday. In the third quarter, its loans grew only 0.9 percent, and the banks said growth would be modest in the fourth quarter.It\u2019s probably too early to get alarmed about the slowdown in lending.One of the reasons growth has decelerated should not be a source of concern. Companies, enjoying stronger revenues and lower taxes, have less need to borrow and roll over existing debt when it comes due. William S. Demchak, chief executive of PNC, said Friday that borrowers were paying down their loans more than expected.Another reason for the lower growth is sensible. Bank executives said they saw signs of the economy overheating and were holding back. At Wells Fargo, loans fell 1 percent in the third quarter. Loans to finance the purchase or construction of buildings used by businesses drove the decline. John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief financial officer, said Friday that the bank had stayed cautious in lending to the sector out of a desire to maintain \u201ccredit discipline.\u201dStill, the weak lending growth could be a sign that the economy is losing momentum.Take mortgages: Rising interest rates are pushing up the cost of mortgages at the same time housing prices in many parts of the country remain elevated. As a result, demand for mortgages has lessened. Wells Fargo\u2019s mortgage applications in the third quarter were lower than in the preceding four quarters.Some companies may be less willing to borrow because their executives are starting to get nervous that President Trump\u2019s trade policies and other geopolitical developments could weigh on global growth. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, sounded a warning about global uncertainties in a statement accompanying the bank\u2019s third-quarter earnings report. JPMorgan\u2019s loan growth, at 4.4 percent, was the strongest of the four banks that reported, but it was still well below the rates it posted in 2016 and 2015.Notably, there are signs outside of the banks\u2019 balance sheets of a weakening in credit growth. Companies borrow in the bond markets, and many loans also end up in special financial entities called collateralized loan obligations. But corporate bond issues were down 15.6 percent this year through September, compared with the same period last year, according to data from Sifma, a financial industry trade group. Debt issued by collateralized loan and debt obligations was down by 47 percent, according to Sifma.Then there is the message that bank stocks are sending. Even with the economy doing well, interest rates rising and the Trump administration\u2019s promises of deregulation, shares in banks have lagged the broader market for months. It\u2019s a sign that investors are not particularly excited about the growth prospects for the core businesses of banking, like lending and trading. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is up 3.5 percent this year. Bank stocks, measured using the KBW Nasdaq Bank index, is down 5.9 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Afghanistan Signs Major Mining Deals Despite Legal Concerns", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 The Afghan government on Friday signed two contracts for the exploration of copper and gold deposits in the north, in a bid to move away from the country\u2019s dependence on foreign aid by tapping its mineral wealth.The contracts, which had been stalled for years, were signed in Washington between the Afghan ministers of finance and mining, and executives from Centar Ltd., an investment company founded by Ian Hannam, a former J.P. Morgan banker who partnered with local Afghan firms to bid for the mines.Centar\u2019s local partner is Sadat Naderi, who until June was Afghanistan\u2019s minister of urban development. The Afghan minerals law prohibits senior officials from bidding on mining contracts for five years after they leave government.Civil society activists say government officials seemed pressured to move forward with the contracts despite unresolved legal issues.\u201cThey signed the contracts without giving us satisfactory answers on concerns that the contracts were very clearly against the law,\u201d said Sayed Ikram Afzali, the executive director of Integrity Watch Afghanistan who met repeatedly with senior officials, including the Afghan president and vice president, to discuss concerns. \u201cIt was very clear that they were under pressure to move on with these contracts \u2014 they said they were facing international pressure to finalize these.\u201dBradley Barnett, the chief executive of Centar, said in a statement that the company had negotiated the deal \u201cin strict adherence to Afghan law and international standards\u201d and that the bidding process had been transparent.Stephen Carter, the Afghanistan campaign leader at Global Witness, an organization focused on mining and conflict, said that was not the point.\u201cRegardless of whether or not this is a good deal for Afghanistan, approving a contract in apparent contravention of the minerals law would undermine the government\u2019s declarations that it is bringing the rule of law to the sector,\u201d said Mr. Carter, the Afghanistan campaign leader at Global Witness, an organization focused on mining and conflict.The government of President Ashraf Ghani, which took office in September 2014, immediately halted major mining contracts issued by its predecessor over concerns of corruption. Mr. Naderi was a political ally of Mr. Ghani during the election campaign, and he was appointed to his cabinet.Mr. Afzali, of Integrity Watch, said the contract that was agreed upon by the previous government has been considerably revised since that time.\u201cDuring the renegotiation of the contract, Mr. Naderi was still a cabinet minister,\u201d Mr. Afzali said.Fatima Faizi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Global Stock Markets Show Mixed Results Day After Big Drop on Wall St.", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConcerns over China\u2019s economy continue to weigh on investors.Concerns over China's economy have dragged on stocks this month. China\u2019s currency, the yuan, hit a 21-month low, amid the tariff fight between China and the United States, the world\u2019s largest economies. \u201cPerceptions in markets are evolving, and more people are nervous that this is going to be a long, drawn-out affair,\u201d said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, a trade group and research provider. China\u2019s government on Friday reported that the economy grew by 6.5 percent over the three months that ended in September compared with a year ago. But growing concerns about the health of its economy, along with rising interest rates that could slow the American economy, have made investors jumpy and worried that a near-perfect investing environment \u2014 low inflation, strong growth and relatively low interest rates \u2014 is becoming tougher to navigate. Here\u2019s a briefing on what has been happening in the stock market. Investors are concerned that rising borrowing costs could crimp domestic growth. Small stocks, which are particularly susceptible to higher borrowing costs, fell 1.8 percent. And other interest-rate sensitive areas of the stock market have been beaten up in recent weeks. The S.&P. home-building index is down 10 percent this month, as mortgage rates have pushed above 5 percent. We\u2019re in the middle of earnings season \u2014 and results from companies could help assuage the worst concerns. On the whole, results should be good. When they\u2019re tallied in a few weeks, profits for S.&P. 500 companies are expected to be up more than 20 percent, compared with last year. That\u2019s largely thanks to strong economic growth in the United States and deep corporate tax cuts. But on Thursday, investors seemed to find gloom even in good earnings news. United Rentals \u2014 a company that rents out construction and industrial equipment \u2014 tumbled 15 percent after reporting earnings that were better than expected. Investors did not like the look of softer-than-expected rental price growth, which can be a leading indicator of a slowdown in the highly cyclical rental industry. \u201cInvestors look at slowing rate growth and say, \u2018Well that\u2019s a negative signal,\u2019\u201d said Steven Fisher, who covers United Rentals as an equity analyst at UBS.

{"Headline": "Mnuchin Withdraws From Saudi Investment Conference Amid Khashoggi Inquiry", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Treasury secretary, who had been fielding calls from executives in recent days about the wisdom of attending, had been urging everyone to focus on the facts and evidence.However, the pressure to cancel \u2014 which included calls from Republican lawmakers \u2014 became too much and, on Thursday, Mr. Mnuchin decided to withdraw. It was uncertain as of Thursday morning whether he would still travel to Riyadh, where he was also planning to visit the Terrorist Financing and Targeting Center, a joint initiative between the United States, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations unveiled a year ago.The decision came after Mr. Mnuchin met with President Trump and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, at the White House on Thursday morning, according to a Treasury spokesman. The three men collectively decided that withdrawing was the appropriate move, though the spokesman would not elaborate on whether or not Mr. Mnuchin was presented with any new information that influenced the decision.Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s withdrawal was announced less than an hour after Mr. Pompeo told journalists that he had made clear to Saudi Arabia\u2019s royal leaders, during a trip to Riyadh this week, that the United States was taking the circumstances surrounding Mr. Khashoggi seriously.The Saudi leaders \u201cassured me that they will conduct a complete, thorough investigation of all of the facts surrounding Mr. Khashoggi and that they\u2019ll do so in a timely fashion,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said in remarks to reporters at the White House after he briefed the president about his meetings in Riyadh. He said the Saudi report would be \u201ctransparent for everyone to see, to ask questions about and to acquire.\u201dTypically reports involving national security matters are highly redacted, if they are released at all. Mr. Pompeo also reminded journalists of America\u2019s long \u201cstrategic\u201d relationship with the Saudis, dating back to 1932, and he said the kingdom remained an \u201cimportant counterterrorism partner.\u201dAfter so many other executives and foreign officials scrapped plans to attend the conference, Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s attendance emerged as a litmus test for America\u2019s commitment to human rights. Mr. Trump and Mr. Pompeo have emphasized that the strategic economic relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia goes back decades, and that it should not be upended by the disappearance of Mr. Khashoggi.Mr. Trump has also been focused on the fact that the Saudis are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase American-made military equipment and has said he does not want to do anything that could cost American jobs.Former Treasury officials and friends of Mr. Mnuchin have been watching closely to see if he would change his mind about the conference and several have spoken candidly about his need to withdraw.As the news media described gruesome audio recordings that purport to depict the dismembering of Mr. Khashoggi, Mr. Mnuchin faced backlash from Republican lawmakers such as Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, as well as several top Democrats.Former Treasury Secretary Paul H. O\u2019Neill, who served during the George W. Bush administration, called the idea of Mr. Mnuchin attending \u201cridiculous\u201d under the circumstances.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fathers and Sons, Reliving on Film the Pain of Addiction", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNic Sheff was sitting next to his father, David, as he recounted one of the lowest moments in his life. It was the time when Nic, college-aged and living in his father\u2019s home, observed his little brother, Jasper, and their younger sister, Daisy, fighting over a few missing dollars that Jasper accused Daisy of stealing from him. All along, Nic knew that he was the thief and that he\u2019d robbed his brother to finance his own methamphetamine habit.Having recently watched this re-enacted in a movie, Nic, now 36 and eight years sober, struggled for a moment as he sought the right words to describe the disembodied way it made him feel.\u201cI \u2014 well, the Nic character \u2014 no, I \u2014 stole the money,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a shameful thing. I knew it was in the script, but just watching it, it was like, oh, God.\u201dThat era was harrowing for the Sheffs. Nic was scrounging the darkest corners of California\u2019s Bay Area in search of his next fix while David was glued to his phone, waiting for the call from his son to come rescue him or from the emergency room to tell him that Nic hadn\u2019t made it.Whatever star-struck feelings the Sheffs may have about the project or the people playing them, they cannot help but brace for the inevitable pain of opening up old wounds \u2014 the discomfort of seeing themselves at their most desperate, on display for a mass audience.But beneath these conflicting emotions is one they did not expect: gratitude, for the chance to reflect on an agonizing past and appreciate how lucky they were to survive it.\u201cOf course it brings us right back to those years, and those years were horrific,\u201d David Sheff added. \u201cAt the same time, it\u2019s really good to remember.\u201d\u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d is a movie that has added resonance for me, too. I also grew up in a family with a drug addict: My father abused cocaine for roughly the first 20 years of my life, and I\u2019ve written previously about how this fractured our relationship and how we eventually repaired it. (In the interest of full disclosure, David Sheff blurbed a memoir I published in 2011.)Though the story told in \u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d is the inverse of mine, the film taps into some greater truths about addiction: what it is like to live with a user, or to recover and relapse back into addiction, and what it is like to carry the shame of someone else\u2019s degrading behavior, even as you care for that person. It doesn\u2019t pretend to prescribe easy solutions to such complicated problems.Most of all, the movie offers a stark illustration of why those of us who have lived through stories like these feel compelled to tell them, again and again.When I sat down with the Sheffs last month, I saw little outward evidence of the traumas they\u2019d endured. David, now 62, has a lined and stately face that disguises his own bohemian coming of age in Northern California, while Nic has retained a boyish, sad-eyed handsomeness.They are comfortable together, and though there\u2019s little that\u2019s unknown about either of them anymore, they were the first to learn each other\u2019s worst secrets and still know exactly how to push one another\u2019s buttons.As open as they are about themselves, and as often as they have told their stories, they still approached the film adaptation process with some wariness, knowing that it meant revisiting their bad choices and outdated perspectives.David recalled his difficult struggle to see his addicted son with sympathy, to make the mental shift from \u201chow could he do this to me and the family and to himself, to understanding that he was troubled and ill.\u201d\u201cOnce I did,\u201d he said, \u201cI could look at him with compassion and sadness instead of judgment and horror.\u201dNic spoke of the enduring prejudices faced by addicts, who are often seen as selfish hedonists. \u201cWe have this image of kids who are getting high, having fun, and they don\u2019t care who it hurts,\u201d he said. Looking at himself from a distance, Nic added: \u201cClearly this kid is not having fun. He\u2019s having trouble.\u201dMr. Van Groeningen, who with his fellow screenwriter Luke Davies (\u201cLion\u201d) merged the Sheffs\u2019 memoirs into a single narrative, told me he was particularly drawn to \u201cDavid\u2019s mythical journey as a father, trying to understand and save his son.\u201d\u201cAt some point it almost read like a thriller,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s this very visceral feeling of never being worry-free.\u201dDuring the film\u2019s development, Mr. Van Groeningen embedded himself with the Sheffs, surfing with Nic and taking long, philosophical walks with David, looking through his family photos and sleeping over at his house.The director said he emerged with the desire to preserve a certain emotional truth about them. \u201cThere\u2019s a sense of unconditional love in their family that is amazing and beautiful,\u201d Mr. Van Groeningen said. \u201cIt is maybe one of the reasons why Nic found his way out.\u201dMr. Chalamet, the Oscar-nominated star of \u201cCall Me by Your Name,\u201d told me that he also felt a personal obligation to spend time with Nic before playing him in \u201cBeautiful Boy.\u201dGiven \u201cthe nature of the story and how intimate it is, I try to be sensitive to that,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be really cavalier as an actor if I didn\u2019t.\u201dBut he added that his and Mr. Carell\u2019s performances were ultimately depictions of the Sheffs and not a perfect recreation of them. \u201cBy the laws of reality, we\u2019re not them and couldn\u2019t possibly be,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat they went through is the actual story,\u201d he said. What interested him and his collaborators was \u201cmaking a movie as universal is possible.\u201dI can say from my own experiences that \u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d achieves this, in the anxious mood it conjures of a father who becomes preoccupied and then obsessed with his efforts to safeguard his son from his drug habit. As David Sheff writes in his memoir, \u201cI became addicted to my child\u2019s addiction.\u201dThe film captures the precariousness of an addict\u2019s sobriety, how easily it is violated, and how humiliating and frustrating the repeated experience is for the sufferer and his loved ones.\u201cThere\u2019s the feeling that everyone is watching you, suspicious of you,\u201d Nic Sheff said. \u201cIt\u2019s something that is difficult for addicts when they\u2019re getting sober, that feeling of, how do I build back trust?\u201d\u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d is also a movie that is undaunted about arriving at an ambiguous ending (which I won\u2019t spoil here); it doesn\u2019t promise the potential redemption of its characters, nor does it strike the relentlessly bleak tone of, say, \u201cRequiem for a Dream.\u201d\u201cIt ends in such a way that you really don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next,\u201d David Sheff said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about the love and commitment within this family. But that\u2019s reality of what it means to be addicted.\u201dThe Sheffs\u2019 memoirs were published long enough ago that the books describe, in earnest, details that their readers were likely to be unfamiliar with at the time, whether the effects of methamphetamine or the pernicious ways it alters users\u2019 brain chemistry.All of which, the Sheffs say, makes the story of \u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d relevant if not urgent, regardless of which drug figures most prominently in it.\u201cMy brain chemistry really liked crystal meth more than anything else,\u201d Nic said. \u201cBut I was doing heroin, I was taking whatever pills I could get. Addicts will take whatever is there in front of them.\u201dDavid added, \u201cThe impacts on the families are no different.\u201dIt\u2019s a bittersweet result of the success of their books and the increased visibility that the movie has already brought them that the Sheffs often find themselves hearing the stories of other families affected by drug addiction. The accounts are delivered in face-to-face conversations, in emails or social media posts, and they are frequently bleak.As David Sheff explained: \u201cOver and over, it\u2019s: \u2018You told our story, but our story had a different ending. Our child died.\u2019\u201dHe continued, \u201cThe idea that I can look up and see Nic sitting next to me as we\u2019re watching this movie \u2014\u2014\u201d His voice trailed off.But other stories give them hope. Scrolling through Twitter on his phone, David landed at a message that he said was \u201cour dream for what the movie would do\u201d: a note from someone who said that \u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d had inspired the writer to reconsider the plight of a cousin with a drug addiction and apologize to him.Even as they are made to reckon yet again with their own personal tragedy, the Sheffs are finding new wrinkles and nuances in it, and discovering new value in the act of revisiting it.\u201cIt feels like we\u2019ve hammered out every last thing we could have possibly had a hidden resentment about,\u201d Nic Sheff said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to deal with every last piece of the complicated puzzle of our history. It feels like there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t talk about, nothing we have to shy away from or ignore. That feels like a huge gift, too.\u201dAdvertisement"}

This is a vote for continuity.\u201dThe new leadership appeared to be acceptable to both the United States and Iran, analysts said.\u201cThey are two people who are very astute, and I think they will do everything to try to find that balance,\u201d Ms. Sky said. \u201cThey want both America and Iran to be friends of Iraq.\u201dIraq faces myriad challenges: fixing the destruction wrought by the battle with the Islamic State; tamping down public anger over poor public services; tackling endemic corruption; and preventing a resurgence of the Islamic State. Addressing them would be a herculean task for any government, and the new Iraqi one has yet to be fully assembled.Mr. Salih was elected in a landslide by the Iraqi Parliament on Tuesday. He designated Mr. Abdul Mahdi, the consensus candidate of the major blocs in Parliament, to form a government.Mr. Abdul Madhi, 76, a trained economist who previously served as vice president, oil minister and finance minister, has 30 days to present his cabinet to Parliament for approval.That, too, was a new twist. Previously, a cabinet and prime minister selected by the big parties behind the scenes have been presented to Parliament as a single package.Some analysts said that change showed a new flexibility.\u201cWe have seen a fragmentation of the political blocs and the inability of the same elite to play the same kinds of games and to make deals in back rooms and then basically tell the Parliament, \u2018This is the new government,\u2019\u201d said Renad Mansour, a research fellow at Chatham House.Two-thirds of those elected in May\u2019s parliamentary election are new to the body, he said, and they seemed less bound by the traditional ways of doing things.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be optimistic about Iraq and there are hard challenges ahead, but there is room for small change,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is room for cautious optimism.\u201dStill, the new government could hardly be described as post-sectarian. According to an unofficial agreement in place since the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003, Iraq\u2019s top three jobs are distributed by sect: the largely ceremonial president is a Kurd; the speaker of Parliament is a Sunni; the prime minister is a Shiite. That arrangement still holds.But the selection of Mr. Abdul Mahdi and Mr. Salih suggest a more conciliatory approach.For years, Mr. Abdul Mahdi served as a member of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a large Shiite party tied to Iran, but he became independent last year. He would be the first prime minister in 13 years not from Islamist Dawa party of former Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, whose Shiite majoritarian leadership alienated Iraq\u2019s Kurds and Sunnis.Mr. Salih, too, is seen as a uniter.Mr. Salih, 58, has a doctorate in engineering from Britain and has previously served as Prime Minister of Iraq\u2019s Kurdistan region and as planning minister in the Iraqi government.Usually, Iraq\u2019s two main Kurdish parties agree on a presidential candidate to send to Parliament in Baghdad to fill the post.But this time, the vote was sharply contested, with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan pushing for Mr. Salih while its rival, the Kurdistan Democratic Party, supported a confidant of Masoud Barzani, the former president of the Kurdistan region who pushed for a referendum on Kurdish independence last year. The referendum passed in a landslide but backfired spectacularly, escalating tensions with Baghdad and ultimately leaving the Kurdish region with less territory and autonomy than it had before.The selection of president went to Parliament, where Mr. Salih won 220 out of 273 votes, largely because he is seen as more conciliatory on the issue of Kurdish independence.\u201cI promise to safeguard Iraq\u2019s unity and safety,\u201d he said as he was sworn in on Wednesday.Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and Falih Hassan from Baghdad.Follow Ben Hubbard on Twitter: @NYTBen.Advertisement"}

If there are sanctions over the alleged murder of Mr. Khashoggi, the Saudis want the world to know, they will fight back.These are empty threats. Saudi Arabia is not in a position to harm the United States. In fact, when it comes to relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia, Washington has all of the leverage. American policymakers shouldn\u2019t forget that.All of this is at risk if the dispute worsens between Saudi Arabia and the United States over Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. Not only could the Saudis not retaliate because their economy is so intertwined with that of the United States, but they will also be susceptible to pressure. Targeted sanctions \u2014 if it comes to that \u2014 could force consultants to withdraw or cut off the Saudi Public Investment Fund\u2019s access to the profits of its investments. More likely, though, is that a continuing dispute would force American businesses like AMC to seriously reconsider involvement in the country because of negative publicity.What about oil? Whereas Saudi Arabia could once shock the world economy by cutting oil exports or production to raise prices, it no longer has that power. The oil market today is significantly more diverse than it was in 1973, when Saudi Arabia and other Arab petroleum exporters unilaterally raised the price of oil and unsettled the American economy. In fact, the United States now produces more oil than Saudi Arabia, and imports make up a smaller percentage of domestically refined crude oil.The Saudis are dependent on the United States, and public opinion is increasingly against them. Already, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has backed out of a high profile finance conference in Riyadh next week. Mr. Trump could use this as a chance to pressure Riyadh to come around on some of his real priorities: the peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians that Jared Kushner is trying to broker; a resolution to the dispute with Qatar, which hosts a critical American military base; billions of dollars more in purchases from American industries.Saudi Arabia is not in a position to threaten the American economy. In fact, the kingdom may be overestimating its own economic clout. It would be a mistake for Riyadh to try to act on its threats against the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and G.O.P. Candidates Escalate Race and Fear as Election Ploys", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump on Monday sharply intensified a Republican campaign to frame the midterm elections as a battle over immigration and race, issuing a dark and factually baseless warning that \u201cunknown Middle Easterners\u201d were marching toward the American border with Mexico.The unsubstantiated charge marked an escalation of Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to stoke fears about foreigners and crime ahead of the Nov. 6 vote, as he did to great effect in the presidential race. Mr. Trump and other Republicans are insistently seeking to tie Democrats to unfettered immigration and violent crime, and in some instances this summer and fall they have attacked minority candidates in nakedly racial terms.\u201cThat is an assault on our country and in that caravan you have some very bad people and we can\u2019t let that happen to our country,\u201d the president said at a rally in Houston on Monday night. Mr. Trump suggested without any proof that the opposition was involved in instigating the caravan. \u201cI think the Democrats had something to do with it,\u201d he said.In targeting the caravan, the president appears determined to end the election season with a cultural fight over national identity rather than the issues that party leaders initially wanted to run on, like tax cuts or the economy.But Mr. Trump has not been alone in seeking to divide the electorate along racial lines this fall: As the congressional elections have approached, a number of Republican candidates and political committees have delivered messages plainly aimed at stoking cultural anxiety among white voters and even appealing to overt racism.The approach taken by Mr. Trump and like-minded Republicans contrasts starkly with the way Democrats have campaigned in 2018, and with how Republican congressional leaders had originally vowed to approach the midterms. Democratic candidates have tended to downplay immigration as a theme, focusing instead on a small number of kitchen-table issues, chiefly health care.After a campaign stop in Florida on Monday, Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president who is mulling a run for the presidency in 2020, criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s ferocity on the migrant issue.\u201cThe caravan is 2,000 miles away. He\u2019s making it sound like they\u2019re breaking through the border. This is hysteria on his part. Let it calm down,\u201d Mr. Biden said.When asked whether Republicans were trying to win the midterms with racial appeals, Mr. Biden shot back, \u201cThey are because that\u2019s who they are.\u201dNewt Gingrich, the former House speaker and occasional Trump adviser, said immigration could be a more potent issue than the economy. \u201cThe caravan is an existential moment,\u201d he said.Citing polls showing a strong majority of the country opposes illegal immigration, Mr. Gingrich argued, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot bigger margin than you\u2019re going to get in the near future on Trump\u2019s economic policy.\u201dAli Noorani, head of the National Immigration Forum, a nonpartisan advocacy group that favors comprehensive immigration reform, said there was little surprise that Mr. Trump would ultimately steer Republicans this way, rather than focusing on economic themes.\u201cWe fully expected the president to place a big bet on an anti-immigrant message as we got closer and closer to the midterms,\u201d Mr. Noorani said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a surprise, it\u2019s that he\u2019s not talking about Kavanaugh or the economy as much as I expected.\u201dBut Mr. Noorani said Republicans face a trade-off: \u201cIs that going to be a message that turns off independent voters?\u201dMuch of the harshest advertising around immigration and race has come in conservative-leaning, relatively homogeneous districts where Republican incumbents are gravely endangered. For lawmakers like Mr. Collins and Representative John Faso of New York, who faces Mr. Delgado, the most likely chance for re-election depends on the strong support of conservative whites.Mr. Delgado said in an interview on Monday that he did not believe voters would accept what he described as Republicans\u2019 \u201cgrotesque misrepresentation\u201d of his biography and beliefs. He acknowledged that the crude negativity of the attacks came as a shock.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this,\u201d Mr. Delgado said. \u201cI think this is divisive, and this is ugly, and I think it has no place in our politics.\u201dPolls suggest close races in the districts held by Mr. Faso and Mr. Collins, as well as the Dallas-area seat where Mr. Allred is running against Representative Pete Sessions.Mr. Trump and other Republicans hope that the image of thousands of migrants seeking to enter the country will further energize his political base, which is predominantly made up of lower-income white voters who are generally suspicious of immigration.Stephen K. Bannon, the immigration hard-liner who advised Mr. Trump in the White House, said Republicans were nationalizing the midterm election around themes that electrify the right. Mr. Bannon likened it to the end of the 2016 election, when Mr. Trump \u201ccame alive in the last few weeks of that campaign, and closed hard.\u201dRight now, Mr. Bannon said, \u201cTrump\u2019s grass-roots base is united and on fire.\u201dJustin Fairfax, Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor, who won a landslide victory in 2017 to become the state\u2019s second-ever black constitutional officer, said Republicans there had attempted to walk a \u201cvery dark political road,\u201d as Mr. Trump is doing now.\u201cAmericans are rejecting that dark vision,\u201d said Mr. Fairfax, a Democrat, adding, \u201cWhat we showed in Virginia is, not only would they lose, but they would lose in historic proportions.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.In Nevada on Monday, former President Barack Obama alluded at an early-voting rally to the Republican campaign, telling Democrats that the G.O.P. would be trying to \u201cappeal to tribe\u201d and \u201cpit one group against the other\u201d over the next two weeks. But there was little expectation among voters there that Mr. Trump might change course.\u201cThis is what they do,\u201d said Reese Williams, a 49-year-old veteran, of Mr. Trump\u2019s party. \u201cThese are the cards they pull all the time.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s dystopian imagery has clearly left an impression with some. Carol Shields, 75, a Republican in northern Minnesota, said she was afraid that migrant gangs could take over people\u2019s summer lake homes in the state.\u201cWhat\u2019s to stop them?\u201d said Ms. Shields, a retired accountant. \u201cWe have a lot of people who live on lakes in the summer and winter someplace else. When they come back in the spring, their house would be occupied.\u201dAlexander Burns reported from New York and Astead W. Herndon from Las Vegas. Peter Baker, Jeremy W.

{"Headline": "Terrorist Threat \u2018More Fluid and Complex Than Ever,\u2019 White House Says", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration vowed to fight \u201cradical Islamist\u201d militants, as well as Iran, as part of a multifront campaign to eliminate the terrorist threat to the United States, according a long-delayed counterterrorism strategy released on Thursday by the White House.Administration officials promoted the strategy, the first released since 2011, as a new approach to fighting terrorism in a \u201clandscape more fluid and complex than ever.\u201d It embraced, however, many of the principles adopted and refined by both the Bush and Obama administrations.The 25-page document noted that extremist groups, armed with encrypted communications and savvy social media skills, are dispersed globally more than ever before. After 17 years of armed conflict, the document said, the United States has had only \u201cmixed success\u201d in preventing attacks against American interests.\u201cWhile we have succeeded in disrupting large-scale attacks in the homeland since 2001,\u201d the report said, \u201cwe have not sufficiently mitigated the overall threat that terrorists pose.\u201dThe sobering assessment of a persistent, resilient threat seemed to contrast with other parts of the strategy that flatly assert the administration will wipe out terrorism against Americans \u2014 a goal most counterterrorism experts say is unrealistic.The plan was delayed by many months, a victim of fierce internal debates over counterterrorism policy as well as a bureaucratic tug of war between President Trump\u2019s two top former security advisers, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster and Thomas P. Bossert, according to a person familiar with the situation.The strategy went through multiple drafts early in 2017 before languishing in the National Security Council. An early draft leaked to Reuters in May 2017 did not include the phrase \u201cradical Islamic terrorism,\u201d which Mr. Trump used regularly during the 2016 presidential campaign but which General McMaster urged N.S.C. staff members to avoid.General McMaster was forced out of the White House in April, and Mr. Bossert was fired days later, after Mr. Trump appointed John R. Bolton to replace General McMaster.The final document mentions \u201cradical Islamist terrorism,\u201d a term that refers to acts of terrorism by Sunni Muslim-affiliated networks like the Islamic State, according to a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the report before its release.But by substituting \u201cIslamist\u201d for \u201cIslamic,\u201d the official said, the strategy seeks to avoid condemning Islam as a whole.The strategy set an uncompromising goal, declaring, \u201cWe will eliminate terrorists\u2019 ability to threaten America, our interests and our engagement in the world.\u201d And it embraced the martial language that former President George W. Bush used after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. \u201cWe are a nation at war,\u201d the document said, \u201cand it is a war that the United States will win.\u201dThat reverses a position taken by former President Barack Obama, who said in May 2013: \u201cOur systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations must continue. But this war, like all wars, must end.\u201dMr. Bolton argued that it was wrong to lull Americans into thinking that the war on terror, which he characterized as a long ideological struggle, was over. \u201cThe idea that somehow we can just say, \u2018Well, we\u2019re tired of this war and it will go away,\u2019 I think is a mistake,\u201d he said.In contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s confident public statements, the report took a sober view of the threat posed by the Islamic State. Despite losing all but 1 percent of the territory it previously seized in Iraq and Syria, it remains a potent threat to the United States, the document said.The extremist group is still supported by eight official offshoots and more than two dozen related networks that regularly conduct attacks across Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East.Similarly, the strategy said Al Qaeda\u2019s global network \u201cremains resilient and poses an enduring threat to the homeland and United States interests around the world.\u201dThe assessment calls for a panoply of familiar tactics.Military, diplomatic and law enforcement officials will apply constant pressure on terrorist networks. Government experts will sleuth ways to cut off terrorist financing and disrupt terrorist travel. Border security will be tightened. Increased attention will be paid to thwart terrorists\u2019 use of the internet to plot attacks, raise money and attract new recruits.\u201cThe debate is really about how to calibrate and where to deploy those tools, and increasingly how to do so in a world in which America\u2019s high-end capabilities are also needed for other pressing threats,\u201d said Joshua A. Geltzer, who was senior director for counterterrorism in the Obama administration and is now the executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection.Mr. Trump came into office without a clearly articulated philosophy for using the military to fight terrorist groups. He had promised to be more aggressive in taking on the Islamic State \u2014 even suggesting during the 2016 campaign that he had a secret plan \u2014 but also signaled a desire to rein in the United States as the world\u2019s peacekeeper.Surrounded by generals who have been at the center of a decade-long shift toward relying on Special Operations rather than ground troops, Mr. Trump has chosen to maintain the same approach as Mr. Obama but has given the Pentagon more latitude in conflict zones like Somalia and Yemen.The strategy also emphasizes the need for allied partners to help conduct counterterrorism missions \u2014 something France is now doing in West Africa and the United Arab Emirates in Yemen.There are demonstrable shifts in at least some of the tools the United States can bring to bear.The strategy, for example, calls for employing cyberoperations against terrorist foes. Last week, White House officials said Mr. Trump had authorized new, classified orders for the Pentagon\u2019s cyberwarriors to conduct offensive attacks against state and nonstate adversaries more freely and frequently.The administration acknowledged that another information-age goal \u2014 fighting extremist ideology, including terrorist organizations\u2019 ability to continue attracting new recruits \u2014 remains one of counterterrorism officials\u2019 most intractable problems.\u201cUnless we counter terrorist radicalization and recruitment,\u201d the document concluded, \u201cwe will be fighting a never-ending battle against terrorism in the homeland, overseas and online.\u201dAdvertisement"}

I feel that being able to stand up and talk about that \u2014\u00a0that there\u2019s a way that we can be constructive in this divisive environment \u2014\u00a0is also important.But so many people think the country is becoming more polarized than ever, and that people are just retreating into their respective political corners. Do you think there\u2019s an appetite for what you\u2019re selling?I think that there is an appetite for it, but I have to talk about it. You have to remind people: Are we really going to be able to solve our problems if we just label everybody and then don\u2019t talk to everybody because they don\u2019t get a 100 percent on our litmus test?Look at what\u2019s happening in our state. We\u2019re not solving problems. Victory in our political climate is when you have a snarky 30-second sound bite. Victory should be accountability for a failing transit system, for a million people leaving New York, for one out of every two children in the major upstate cities being born into poverty. Saying, \u2018These are my ideas to stop this.\u2019Both parties have been complicit in this culture of corruption and politics as usual in Albany. It\u2019s both parties that have refused to do anything to change it. When you say snarky sound bites, are you talking about the governor\u2019s attacks on Marc Molinaro, his Republican opponent?Correct. I think if you\u2019re running for office, you should be talking about your ideas, not just attacking your opponent in vacuous smears and overstatements. Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.How much of your run has to do with your own contentious history with the governor?Those solutions, they were not serious, they were not solving problems, but they were good optics. I have a seriousness of purpose about public policy and accountability and transparency that I think puts me apart from the current administration. You have long been a registered Democrat. For voters who are trying to find the candidate that best aligns with their ideology, where would you put yourself in relation to Governor Cuomo?There is no ideology that works 100 percent of the time. What works is when you convene people and ask them to use their best brainpower. I am a pragmatist that believes in solving problems to help people.Several of your biggest supporters, including the leadership of SAM, the group under whose banner you are running, come from Wall Street. Do you think that\u2019s what voters want, or has that affiliation become toxic?I don\u2019t think voters care where your money comes from. I really don\u2019t.I do not accept contributions from LLCs, and I think voters think that there is a broken campaign finance system. But they are much more interested in talking about the substance of your ideas than they are in talking about where the money comes from.And, that\u2019s where the money is. That\u2019s where people have income to donate to campaigns, so that\u2019s where you go to fund-raise.It was definitely a large part of my consideration. This platform of a ballot line can be used to advocate for real change, whether that be in having higher ethical standards for governance, fiscal responsibility and a seriousness of purpose. Your platform highlights a lot of economic issues. Where do you stand on the social issues that have become so important \u2014 and divisive \u2014\u00a0in recent years? The beauty of having a 16-year track record is that I\u2019ve already taken positions, separate and apart from being a gubernatorial candidate. I\u2019ve stood with Planned Parenthood numerous times. Syracuse was a sanctuary city. I have a strong platform on public education. I have stood up actively and said we have to end cash bail now.Have you had support from other elected officials?Privately, yes.But no one is willing to come out and stick their finger in the governor\u2019s eye? Correct.What will you count as success in this campaign?I think it already has been a success, because I\u2019ve had a number of people who have become engaged in the process who were not before, and who were feeling very cynical about it. We\u2019ve been talking about real issues of substance. On the professional level, being able to advocate for these serious issues is rewarding.And on a personal level, I have met lots of very thoughtful and interesting people who want to be involved in making the system better.There are multiple ways to measure victory in this kind of race. One of them is to say, were we able to galvanize people who will continue to say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to sit by and normalize corruption as a part of our democracy?\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Italy Could Be the Epicenter of the Next Financial Crisis", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHistory suggests that the world is about due for another financial crisis. One of the places it might start, according to a growing number of indicators, is Italy.Many of the ingredients are there. A pile of questionable debt. Weak banks. An erratic government. And a sizable economy able to inflict collateral damage outside Italian borders.Bond investors, always good for a coldblooded appraisal of a country\u2019s solvency, have been sounding the alarm. The Rome government\u2019s populist spending plans, widely regarded in financial circles as reckless, have caused market interest rates on Italian debt to spike, threatening to create a so-called doom loop that would ripple through the struggling economy.The proposed budget has exposed the seams in Italy\u2019s governing coalition, where one party favors small-business-friendly tax cuts and the other enormously expensive welfare programs. More broadly, it has divided the populist government, which has vowed to press ahead with a budget it views as a political imperative, and the Italian financial establishment, which fears what the spending will do to the country\u2019s economy and its credibility and relationship with Europe.You don\u2019t have to be Italian to be worried about the repercussions.Financial crises tend to arrive every decade or so, and Italy is near the top of a list of flash points that could touch off the next one, alongside Turkey\u2019s economic and political turmoil, President Trump\u2019s trade war, Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union and a broad slowdown in global growth.But in contrast to the financial crisis that began in 2008, central banks may not be able to come to the rescue this time, said Richard Portes, a professor of economics at London Business School. They used up much of their crisis fighting tools coping with the last meltdown.\u201cIt would be very difficult for Mario Draghi to think of another way to get out of the mess,\u201d Mr. Portes said, referring to the president of the European Central Bank.That is why investors are so worried about Italy. The eurozone is still recovering from a debt crisis that began in Greece in 2010. Italy, the currency bloc\u2019s third-largest economy, accounts for 11 percent of the European Union\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 10 times as much as Greece \u2014 and has the potential to create far more damage.Many of the country\u2019s problems are longstanding, such as the unusually high number of problem loans on its banks\u2019 balance sheets and chronically slow growth. Italy\u2019s economy has still not made up the ground it lost after the 2008 financial crisis. The new element is Italy\u2019s populist government, which to the horror of European Union officials and bond markets is pledging money it doesn\u2019t have to fulfill campaign promises.Unlike previous Italian governments that bristled at, but ultimately complied with, demands from the European Union, Italy\u2019s populists have made their careers running against Brussels.They are pursuing a brazenly confrontational course with the European Commission, never mind the market reaction or the consequences for Italian savers, who are among the biggest holders of government bonds.\u201cThe enemies of Europe are those barricaded in the bunker of Brussels,\u201d Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant League and the country\u2019s most powerful politician, said this week in a news conference. He has repeatedly called Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission\u2019s president, and Pierre Moscovici, its economics commissioner, the villains who \u201chave ruined Europe and our country\u201d through austerity measures.Under eurozone rules, Italy must submit its budget for European Commission scrutiny by Monday. The proposed spending plan calls for a deficit equal to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, a figure considered way too high for a country whose total government debt equals 131 percent of G.D.P., more than double the eurozone limit.The previous, center-left government had proposed a budget with a 0.8 percent deficit, which would have allowed Italy to continue chipping away at its total debt.A significant portion of the new budget would go toward a broad welfare program, a key campaign promise of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement to its young, unemployed and frustrated base, many in Italy\u2019s depressed south.\u201cIn a decisive manner, with this measure, with this budget, we will have abolished poverty,\u201d said Luigi Di Maio, the political leader of the Five Star Movement and Italy\u2019s economic development minister, in a television interview last month.In addition, the hostile tone that the Italians have taken with the European Union, the very thing that helped put them in power, \u201cindicates that the government sees political opportunities in attacking the E.U.\u2019s fiscal rules, especially in the run-up to European parliamentary elections next May,\u201d the report said.Fitch has signaled it could downgrade its rating of Italy\u2019s debt, a step that if matched by other ratings agencies would further raise the government\u2019s cost to borrow.The government has cut some expenditures, but in categories that further provoke Brussels. For example, Rome has suspended plans to acquire a new missile defense system at a time when Europe is trying to appease Mr. Trump by spending more on NATO.Officials in Brussels face a dilemma, though. They will lose credibility if they fail to discipline an errant member. But if they take too hard a line they will simply make Brussels a convenient scapegoat for Italian politicians.The Italian government, at least for now, appears popular and immune to electoral pain. When the Italian Parliament passed the budget proposal at the end of September, Mr. Di Maio and his allies in the Five Star Movement took to the balcony of the Palazzo Chigi, the seat of Italian government, and flashed victory signs as a crowd of lawmakers and supporters below them chanted, \u201cLuigi! Luigi!\u201dBut public support could begin to waver if investors continue to lose confidence in Italian debt, which would have severe consequences for the economy.Italy is still a long way from the darkest days of the eurozone debt crisis in 2011, when investors bid the market rate, or yield, on government bonds to over 7 percent. But the yield has climbed significantly since the populist government won elections this year, topping 3.7 percent this week, compared with 1.7 percent in May.Italian banks like UniCredit have large holdings of their home country\u2019s debt. When yields rise, the value of their bond holdings goes down, eroding their capital and raising questions about their health. UniCredit shares have slumped to about 12 euros recently from \u20ac18 in April.In an effort to preserve capital, banks then become more cautious about lending. Consumers and businesses have to pay higher interest rates to borrow, or might not be able to get credit at all, strangling the economy.If economic growth slows and unemployment rises, fewer people pay taxes and the government\u2019s financial situation deteriorates further. Investors then insist on a higher risk premium on Italian bonds \u2014 a higher return \u2014 and the cycle repeats. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a doom loop.\u201cDebt is the great multiplier of turbulence for Italy,\u201d Luigi Federico Signorini, the deputy director general of the Bank of Italy, told a parliamentary hearing on Tuesday. \u201cOscillations in its value also have effects on the Italian individuals, families, companies and financial institutions that hold it.\u201dPolls show that Italians do not want to give up the euro, a fact that may restrain the government. It has shown in the past it would react to pressure, appointing a moderate, Giovanni Tria, as finance minister after objections were raised to the initial choice, Paolo Savona, an economist who had written about exiting the euro.But Mr. Tria has been worn down by the lengthy budget negotiations and subjected to humiliating attacks by the leaders of the League and Five Star Movement. In an audio recording leaked to the Italian media, a high-ranking official in the government who is also a prominent member of the Five Star Movement threatened to fire bureaucrats under Mr. Tria if they couldn\u2019t find money to get the welfare measure in the budget.On Tuesday, Claudio Borghi, the president of the budget commission in the Lower House of Parliament who is a member of the euroskeptic League, cut off Mr. Tria\u2019s microphone during committee hearings.Mr. Tria has insisted he is not considering resigning.Provoking Brussels has been a winning political strategy for the current crop of Italian leaders, and they show no signs of giving it up.\u201cWe care about markets,\u201d Mr. Di Maio said in a television interview last week. But faced with a choice between bond yields and the Italian people, he added, \u201cI choose the Italian people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marriott Workers Struggle to Pay Bills, and Credit Union Fees", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorking as a dishwasher at the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown, Amos Troyah made about $30,000 in a recent 12-month period. Roughly $2,000 of it was spent on an especially frequent expense: fees on his checking and savings accounts at the Marriott Employees\u2019 Federal Credit Union.The fees came in increments like $6 and $10 \u2014 minimum-balance fees, excess-transaction fees, automatic money-transfer fees. On occasion, they were joined by that pooh-bah of personal finance charges, the overdraft fee, at a hefty $35.Thousands of Marriott workers around the country are on strike, complaining that stagnant wages and unsteady hours have made it difficult to stay afloat. At a time when they are under particular pressure, the credit union may be adding to their struggles. Other employees said Mr. Troyah\u2019s experience with fees was common.For more affluent Marriott employees, on the other hand, credit union membership can be a very good deal. Typical interest rates on car loans and mortgages obtained through the credit union are below the national average, according to financial filings. And better-paid employees less frequently need services that incur high fees, like overdraft protection.What\u2019s more, while the credit union is officially independent from Marriott, the board that oversees it consists primarily of Marriott managers who may not always be sensitive to the inequities these policies impose.The Marriott workers\u2019 experience is a stark example of trends that are increasingly bearing down on the nearly 100 million people nationwide who have credit union accounts.Credit unions \u2014 not-for-profit institutions that are owned by their depositors and receive a federal tax subsidy \u2014 were long considered a way to democratize banking. They were meant to serve workers who lacked access to the same financial services as middle managers or executives. Many early credit unions were managed by workers from small offices off factory floors. With the money made on loans, often to better-paid workers, they could offer checking and savings accounts at little or no cost.This philosophy largely persisted into the 1990s, even as credit unions grew larger and hired professional managers. \u201cYou had this relationship with people you were serving that you never lost track of,\u201d said Randy Chambers, the president of Self-Help Credit Union in North Carolina, which has merged with a handful of smaller credit unions across the state.Some credit unions still see their mission in such terms. But in recent decades, many have subtly shifted their approach. As falling interest rates made loans less lucrative, credit unions largely turned to fees to help replace the lost income. Over the past quarter-century, the average value of the fees collected for every dollar of interest income has risen to nearly 17 cents, from just under 7 cents.For credit unions harder pressed to fund their operations, that figure can get much higher. The GE Credit Union of Connecticut makes 34 cents in fees for every dollar of interest on loans, according to last year\u2019s regulatory filings. The Montgomery County Employees Federal Credit Union in Maryland makes 44 cents.But even against this backdrop, Marriott is an outlier. It takes in 52 cents in fees for every dollar of interest income.As a result, some Marriott workers find themselves in a kind of financial double jeopardy: Low pay from Marriott keeps their account balances minimal, and those modest balances lead to more fees, crimping their assets further.\u201cThe money gets into my account, and they take it out when I overdraft,\u201d Mr. Troyah said. \u201cThey are robbing me.\u201dOn its own, raising more income through fees is defensible. For example, in a given month, only a minority of accounts typically go into the red. Not charging overdraft fees or minimum-balance fees is, in effect, a decision to ask other members to subsidize that minority.\u201cPeople came around to the idea of it not being all that fair to do it that way,\u201d said Mike Schenk, chief economist at the Credit Union National Association, an industry trade group. \u201cThat you ought to pay for the services you use.\u201dBut the effect in many cases is that the people least able to bear the costs of operating a credit union are gradually paying more of them.Overdraft fees in particular have provoked controversy within the credit union world. \u201cWe have a hard time taking seriously any depository institution claim to trying to serve the underserved, making credit available to financially distressed people and charging those same people $30 to $35 for overdraft,\u201d said Rebecca Born\u00e9, senior policy counsel for the Center for Responsible Lending, which is affiliated with the Self-Help Credit Union.The Marriott credit union, whose membership of about 32,000 includes housekeepers, dishwashers and cooks, would seem to fill that bill. While fees can be an issue for any credit union with financially strapped members, Marriott\u2019s are unusually high: more than 1.7 percent of the credit union\u2019s assets. That is three times the percentage generated by fees at credit unions serving workers at Safeway, Publix and Nordstrom \u2014 broadly similar service-sector employers.Glenn Newton, the credit union\u2019s chief executive, said that looking at such measures can be misleading because the modest wealth of his members leads to low average deposits. That leaves the credit union with less money for generating income. In effect, he said, the credit union must pay the same costs per member as other credit unions, but has fewer ways to offset those costs.He urged adjusting the analysis to account for the small deposits \u2014 say, by considering how much greater its assets would be if its average deposit was more typical of the industry. That would bring the fee ratio in line with other service-sector credit unions.As a practical matter, however, the fees that an average Marriott credit union member pays across all services \u2014 $94 last year \u2014 are far higher than at these other institutions, and higher than at credit unions of a similar size.Jose Ramirez Paredes makes just over $13 an hour cleaning banquet rooms and other public areas at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront. Mr. Ramirez Paredes said through an interpreter that he helped support his stepson, as well as a daughter and two grandchildren living nearby. He sells Amway products on the side to cover his expenses, which include a mortgage and a car payment that together cost him about $1,000 per month.But even so, he often falls short. The August statement for Mr. Ramirez Paredes\u2019s credit union account shows more than $800 in overdraft fees so far this year. Mr. Newton said that overdraft fees had declined by nearly 10 percent between 2013 and last year, and that he believed such cases were unusual.Workers like Mr. Ramirez Paredes and Mr. Troyah say their financial problems are heightened by Marriott\u2019s decision to rely more on temps and less on full-time employees, who have seen their hours cut back and their annual earnings fall. According to Rachel Gumpert, a spokeswoman for Unite Here, the union that represents the company\u2019s striking workers, a central issue in the dispute is that workers are having to hold down multiple jobs to support themselves because they aren\u2019t receiving enough hours at the hotel chain.Mr. Ramirez Paredes says that even though he is considered a full-time employee, he is frequently assigned to work only three or four days per week, sometimes as little as one day. (If his hours in a six-month period fall too much, he will lose his full-time status.) Mr. Troyah\u2019s W-2 forms show that his income declined from about $34,000 in 2016 to about $28,000 in 2017 because, he says, Marriott cut his hours.Both men said that they had asked their managers why they didn\u2019t receive more hours, and that the managers had told them business was slow. But that claim was at odds with the presence of workers dispatched from staffing firms. Marriott declined to comment.Lekesha Wheelings, who has worked as a line cook at the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown for the past 12 years, says that she makes just over $19 an hour, but that she, too, is sometimes sent home early and ends up with fewer than 40 hours per week.Ms. Wheelings, who lives with her eldest daughter and supports twin 17-year-old children, said she made nearly $45,000 in 2016, but only about $39,500 last year because she worked less.To cope with the strain in her personal finances, Ms. Wheelings has at times resorted to what is known as a mini-loan from the credit union, a six-month loan of up to $500 with an 18 percent interest rate \u2014 generally the legal limit for federal credit unions \u2014 and a $35 application fee. Including the fee, the effective annual interest rate on such a loan is about 40 to 50 percent.But even more reasonably priced short-term loans can hurt those with the most precarious finances, making them more likely to run up fees on the checking side. \u201cIf someone can\u2019t afford more debt, the expectation is that it would increase their overall financial burden and lead to more overdraft fees,\u201d Ms. Born\u00e9 said of the mini-loans.During the months in which she was repaying a mini-loan beginning in late 2014, the Marriott credit union deducted at least $450 in overdraft fees from Ms. Wheelings\u2019s checking account, according to her statements. The loan repayment left less money for such expenses as an $8.47 Netflix subscription and a $17 membership in a legal assistance service, but the overdraft protection allowed them to glide through each month, at a steep markup.Ms. Wheelings says she plans to keep using the credit union but would like to pay fewer fees. Mr. Ramirez Paredes, alarmed by the fees, says he plans to close his account.By contrast, more affluent workers, including some executives at Marriott, appear to benefit at little cost from the credit union, securing favorable interest rates on car loans and mortgages while largely avoiding heavy fees.Public records show that several current and former executives have obtained large mortgages from the credit union. They include Don Cleary, the Canada president for Marriott International, who received a $1 million mortgage in December 2016; William McGowan, a longtime design and project manager ($875,000 in December 2014); Michael Rhoads, senior director of international accounting ($825,000 in November 2016); and Norman Jenkins, a former senior vice president ($765,000 in February 2017).\u201cThe proper comparison isn\u2019t whether or not an hourly associate has access to the same loans or interest rates as a company executive,\u201d said Mr. Newton, the chief executive. \u201cRather, it\u2019s whether the credit union offers value to the members, based on their individual credit profile, versus what they could have received at other financial institutions.\u201dMr. Newton said the loans the credit union does offer to low-paid workers, like the mini-loan, are a more affordable option than products they could obtain elsewhere, such as payday loans.Credit unions are legally separate from the companies whose employees they serve. But there is often significant overlap between managers of the two organizations.At the Marriott credit union, five board members are Marriott employees with \u201cvice president\u201d in their title; three are employees with \u201cdirector\u201d in their title. The only \u201con property\u201d employee on the board is the general manager of the Bethesda Suites Marriott in Maryland.While any member can run for a seat on a credit union\u2019s board, many boards are stacked with company executives and those with financial expertise to oversee their increasingly sophisticated operations.Some credit unions take steps to make sure they remain sensitive to the needs of members. The State Employees\u2019 Credit Union in North Carolina maintains a local advisory council composed of workers at each of its more than 250 branches, in addition to its board. The local bodies meet with managers four times a year and are apt to give them an earful if they encounter fees or lending policies that workers regard as unfair. That approach is relatively uncommon in the industry, though Mr. Newton said the Marriott credit union had periodically sought feedback from members in surveys.\u201cMembers should elect the board to look after their own interests, and one of those should be balancing who pays for what,\u201d said Jim Blaine, who ran the State Employees\u2019 Credit Union for decades before retiring in 2016. But in practice, he added, \u201cyou can have a board of senior managers who truly don\u2019t understand that 75 percent of people live paycheck to paycheck.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When I was getting out of grad school at the University of Chicago in 1969, I applied for six different jobs in six different finance fields. I was not dedicated to any one, but I had had a summer job at Citibank. I liked the people. I liked what I did. And so I went to Citibank in the equity research department.That was nearly 50 years ago. Do you still like your work?Every day is different, and every investment is different. The variability of investing makes it an interesting intellectual challenge. That\u2019s incredibly enjoyable.You say that investors need to be counterintuitive, and that everything that\u2019s obvious is wrong. What do you mean?Here\u2019s an example.Superior investing is taking advantage of the errors of others. In order to get an above-average return in the long run, you have to buy things for less than they\u2019re worth, which is to say that the other people out there have to be selling that thing for less than its worth.They\u2019re making a mistake and you need to act in a contrarian way to take advantage of that.Do most people understand when to buy or sell? Most people think the goal is to buy good things and sell bad things. How many people understand that there is no asset that is so good that it can\u2019t become overpriced and lethal? And there are few assets that are so bad that they can\u2019t become cheap enough to become compellingly attractive?Your firm, Oaktree, specializes in global alternative investments. Why? If you look at assets that everybody knows about, understands and is objective toward, then it\u2019s less likely you\u2019re going to find mispricings. If you\u2019re going to find bargains or overpricings to short, then it has to be in things that are not understood, known and appreciated.Why write about market cycles? One of the best ways to have a handle on macrorisk, marketwide risk, is by understanding where we stand in a cycle. When the market is high in its cycle, it\u2019s probably pretty risky. When it\u2019s low, most of the time, it turns out that they were giving away money, if only you could figure that out at the time.You say you are not an emotional person, which helps you in a market where others are very emotional. Can others learn how to do that?If you understand the role of emotion, you probably can teach yourself to be less emotional.But can the emotional person become an unemotional person through intention? I would be somewhat skeptical.I think it\u2019s easier if you\u2019re born unemotional.Well, that lets me out. It also explains why I\u2019m in the index funds. And there\u2019s another reason: I can\u2019t outthink people like you. But that\u2019s the point. You remember what Dirty Harry said? \u201cA man\u2019s got to know his limitations.\u201dI don\u2019t write to make investing easy. I write to show how hard it is so that people won\u2019t try tricks that they can\u2019t do. You know what they say, don\u2019t try this at home, right?Why do you believe in market timing?I believe it is highly possible to improve your long-term results by adjusting your investment position at the extremes of the cycle. Not that often. But at the extremes.And by the way, I think that it works fairly dependably at the extremes, but it does not work at all dependably otherwise.So that means you shouldn\u2019t trade a lot?Unless the situation is compelling, trading doesn\u2019t make sense. Waiting patiently is an essential part of being an investor. And when you do take action, do it dynamically, forcefully.If you do a little trading all the time it is going to be a disaster. I always wondered what would happen if we set up a trading room so that it only accepted orders on Thursdays. And in between, all people could do is think. Maybe you would do better.A good percentage of the money we manage here is 10-year money. You put your money in and you can\u2019t get it out for 10 years.I believe denying clients the ability to be hyper- traders is doing them a favor. Most people are not adept enough to take advantage of short-term mis-valuations, and I put myself in that category.Have investors become smarter in the 50 years you\u2019ve been doing this? They\u2019ve gotten more information. They know more about more asset classes. There are fewer secrets in the world today.On the other hand, I think they are more shortsighted, more short term oriented than they used to be.And while people now understand more about contrarianism and counterintuitiveness, I don\u2019t think the human race has become less emotional.So it\u2019s kind of a holding action.Advertisement"}

But in reality, according to the complaint, Exxon\u2019s internal estimates discounted the potential future costs of climate policies, even though the threat of government action \u201cexposed the company to greater risk from climate change regulation than investors were led to believe.\u201d\u201cExxon provided false and misleading assurances that it is effectively managing the economic risks posed to its business by the increasingly stringent policies and regulations that it expects governments to adopt to address climate change.\u201dScott J. Silvestri, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, said Wednesday that the New York attorney general\u2019s office had \u201cdoubled down on its tainted, meritless investigation by filing a complaint against Exxon Mobil.\u201dThe \u201cbaseless allegations,\u201d Mr. Silvestri said, \u201care a product of closed-door lobbying by special interests, political opportunism and the attorney general\u2019s inability to admit that a three-year investigation has uncovered no wrongdoing. The company looks forward to refuting these claims as soon as possible and getting this meritless civil lawsuit dismissed.\u201dBarbara D. Underwood, the New York attorney general, brought the lawsuit under the Martin Act, a state law that gives her sweeping powers to investigate and prosecute securities fraud. The suit demands that Exxon turn over all the money it made through the alleged fraud and make restitution to investors. \u201cInvestors put their money and their trust in Exxon, which assured them of the long-term value of their shares, as the company claimed to be factoring the risk of increasing climate change regulation into its business decisions,\u201d Ms. Underwood said. \u201cYet as our investigation found, Exxon often did no such thing.\u201dThe lawsuit says that Exxon told investors that when it was planning for its oil and gas reserves, its investments and its estimates of demand for its products, it applied an added cost, or \u201cproxy cost,\u201d that represented the likely effects of future climate regulations. But in many cases, the suit says, the company \u201capplied much lower proxy costs than it represented or no proxy costs at all,\u201d which exposed Exxon to greater regulatory risk.Prosecutors added that \u201cExxon\u2019s fraud was sanctioned at the highest levels of the company,\u201d including by its former chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson. Mr. Tillerson, who went on to serve as President Trump\u2019s first secretary of state, \u201cknew for years that the company\u2019s representations concerning proxy costs were misleading,\u201d according to the complaint.Lee Wasserman, director of the Rockefeller Family fund, which supports holding fossil fuel companies accountable for climate damages, said of Ms. Underwood\u2019s lawsuit: \u201cApparently, Exxon has deceived the investing public about the economic consequences of climate change, just as they deceived the general public about the \u2018catastrophic\u2019 harm they knew their products would cause. It\u2019s past time for Exxon to make their investors whole and to pay its fair share of the massive damages communities across the nation now face.\u201dThe New York lawsuit poses \u201ca real risk to Exxon\u2019s reputation,\u201d said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. He said it was especially concerning for investors, who rely on the company\u2019s statements.\u201cIf Exxon has been misleading on this,\u201d Mr. Burger said, \u201cwhat else has it been misleading about?\u201dClifford Krauss contributed reporting from Houston.Advertisement"}

A private foundation raised the production and installation costs of 3 million euros (about $3.5 million), which are financed half by French donations, and half by donations by Americans.\u201cIt was urgent to find a place after too much political rambling,\u201d Christophe Girard, the deputy mayor in charge of cultural affairs, said on Friday, after he visited the new location with Mr. Koons the day earlier. \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake goes beyond arts.\u201dThe American artist still needs a definitive green light and logistical studies need to be completed, but Mr. Girard said that the location met all the criteria and that the inauguration would likely take place in 2019.Mr. Koons, whose sculpture was inspired by the Statue of Liberty, said in 2016 that he wanted the work, a hand holding a fistful of balloon flowers, to \u201ccommunicate a sense of future, of optimism, the joy of offering.\u201dHe described it as a proof of the longstanding French-American friendship in troubled times. Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, has called it \u201ca diplomatic gift as much as an artistic one.\u201dThe piece, which is made of bronze, aluminum and stainless steel, is one of the artist\u2019s largest \u2014 it is 34 feet high, 27 feet wide and 32 feet deep.But what was supposed to be a buoyant present has morphed into a heavy burden.Mr. Koons and city officials had first agreed that the \u201cBouquet\u201d would be installed in the plaza in front of the Palais de Tokyo, an area popular with tourists located across the Seine, with a view of the Eiffel Tower.Yet as the plan lingered for months, general discontent over the artist\u2019s intentions started to dovetail with technical challenges over the feasibility of the project.The letter, which included signatures from the artist Christian Boltanski and a former culture minister, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mitterrand, said Mr. Koons\u2019s work symbolized \u201ca type of industrial, spectacular and speculative art.\u201d\u201cWe appreciate gifts,\u201d the letter said, but ones that are \u201cfree, unconditional and without ulterior motives.\u201dA few months later, the Culture Minister Fran\u00e7oise Nyssen dropped the initial plans, arguing that the sculpture was too heavy for the plaza\u2019s pavement and that it should stand somewhere \u201cpopular, visible and shared by everyone.\u201dAs the project dragged on, the sculpture was sitting in a German warehouse.\u201cThe general outcry was in part caused by a form of outdated anti-Americanism, but it was also a sincere, offended one,\u201d said Guillaume Piens, the director of the Art Paris Art Fair. \u201cWhenever artists touch on memory and victims, it\u2019s hard to see an uninterested, mere artistic act only.\u201dMr. Piens added that Parisians preferred softer messages about the city\u2019s resilience, not the colorful extravaganza that the \u201cBouquet of Tulips\u201d displayed, in sharp contrast with the public mood here.Other works of arts dedicated to the victims have been better accepted.Mr. Koons\u2019s \u201cBouquet of Tulips\u201d features 11 flowers and not a dozen, his art gallerist in France, J\u00e9r\u00f4me de Noirmont, said, with the missing 12th meant to represent the victims of the attacks. And unlike most of Mr. Koons\u2019s similar work, Mr. de Noirmont added, the flowers will be matte, and not shiny, \u201cout of respect for the French people.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018There Is Still So Much Evil\u2019: Growing Anti-Semitism Stuns American Jews", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUntil recent years, many Jews in America believed that the worst of anti-Semitism was over there, in Europe, a vestige of the old country.\u201cThis kind of evil makes me think of the Holocaust and how people can be so cruel, that there is so much evil in the world, still,\u201d said Moshe Taube, 91, a retired cantor from Congregation Beth Shalom in Pittsburgh and a survivor of the Holocaust.But it did not come out of nowhere, said experts in anti-Semitism. At the same time that Jews were feeling unprecedented acceptance in the United States, the climate was growing increasingly hostile, intensifying in the two years since President Trump was elected. And it comes at a time when attacks on Jews are on the rise in Europe as well, with frequent anti-Semitic episodes in France and Germany.The hate in the United States came into full view last year as white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Va., with lines of men carrying torches and chanting, \u201cJews will not replace us.\u201dThe Anti-Defamation League logged a 57 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States in 2017, compared to the previous year \u2014 including bomb threats, assaults, vandalism, and anti-Semitic posters and literature found on college campuses.\u201cI\u2019m not a Chicken Little who\u2019s always yelling, \u2018It\u2019s worse than it\u2019s ever been!\u2019 But now I think it\u2019s worse than it\u2019s ever been,\u201d said Deborah E. Lipstadt, a professor of Holocaust history at Emory University in Atlanta and the author of a planned book on anti-Semitism.Ms. Lipstadt said she did not wish to be seen as alarmist, because in some ways \u201cthings have never been better\u201d for Jews in America.But she likened anti-Semitism to a herpes infection that lies dormant and re-emerges at times of stress. It does not go away, no matter how \u201cacculturated\u201d Jews have become in America, because \u201cit\u2019s a conspiracy theory,\u201d said Ms. Lipstadt, whose win at trial against a Holocaust denier in England was portrayed in the 2016 movie \u201cDenial.\u201dWhat has changed, said several experts in interviews, is that conspiracy theories and \u201cdog whistles\u201d that resonate with anti-Semites and white supremacists are being circulated by establishment sources, including the president and members of Congress. Bizarre claims about Jews have moved from the margins to the establishment.Prominent recent examples include unfounded conspiracy theories about George Soros, a wealthy donor to Democratic Party causes and a Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9 from Hungary who survived the Nazis.Mr. Soros has also been accused of financing the caravan of Hondurans and Guatemalans fleeing north on foot through Mexico \u2014 another claim with no factual basis.Tom Steyer is an Episcopalian and is of Jewish descent. Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is Jewish. After more explosive devices were found in the homes and offices of other Democratic leaders and supporters, Mr. McCarthy deleted the tweet.Anti-Semitism has also become a charged topic on many American college campuses, with Israel as the detonator.Activists on the left \u2014 sometimes including young Jews \u2014 call for boycotts and divestments from companies doing business in Israel, or the occupied territories. Mainstream Jewish groups are now branding such campaigns as anti-Semitism. Where to draw the line between criticism of Israel and anti-Semitism is a growing source of friction in many colleges and state capitals.In Europe, Jewish leaders have been confronting open hatred toward Jews, also sometimes linked to animosity toward Israel.In France, Jews have increasingly faced attacks and insults from members of the country\u2019s large Muslim community. In March, an 85-year-old Holocaust survivor, Mireille Knoll, was knifed to death in her apartment by a young man who shouted \u201cAllahu akbar.\u201d Prosecutors classified it as an anti-Semitic hate crime.In a 2015 study, 42 percent of French Jews surveyed said that they had suffered insults or aggressive acts at the hands of Muslims.In Germany, anti-Semitism remains a daily occurrence, sometimes taking on the form of criminal attacks on Jews or Jewish institutions, but often in more casual insults or the questioning of the country\u2019s post-World War II commitment to \u201cnever again\u201d repeat the Nazi Holocaust.One of the most prominent anti-Semitic attacks this year, in which a young Syrian struck a man wearing a skullcap on the street of a trendy Berlin neighborhood, prompted the head of Germany\u2019s main Jewish organization to warn Jews against openly wearing skullcaps, or other public displays of their religion.A demonstration in support of the country\u2019s Jews drew thousands of people to the streets, but months later, in the midst of violent demonstrations by neo-Nazis in the eastern city of Chemnitz, masked assailants threw rocks and bottles at a local Jewish restaurant and shouted anti-Semitic insults, the owner told the police.Nadine Epstein, editor in chief of Moment, an independent Jewish magazine in the United States, said that in 2014 the magazine did a special section on anti-Semitism, interviewing a wide range of scholars and leaders in the field. She said that her conclusion was that anti-Semitism, while persistent, was mostly a problem in Europe. But \u201cit wasn\u2019t really an issue in the U.S.,\u201d she said.\u201cFour plus years later,\u201d she added in an email, \u201cwe live in a very different world where nationalism, and with it anti-Semitism, is on the rise, stirred up by the rhetoric of one candidate in the 2016 presidential campaign. It\u2019s been building ever since, and now that we are in the run-up to the midterms, the first national election since, we are seeing the consequences of such dangerous rhetoric.\u201dAn earlier version of this article erroneously stated that Tom Steyer is Jewish.

{"Headline": "Making Sense of the Selling in the Stock Market", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome stock declines are more foreboding than others.The selling that has driven down the markets continued on Friday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 9 percent from its peak in September, and on pace for its worst month since the 2008 financial crisis. Swoons like this one can be unnerving, in part because they suggest all is not well with the broader economy.But some of the selling may not augur much.Take technology stocks, whose recent declines have played a big role in dragging down the overall market. Shares of big tech companies have soared this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up more than 17 percent at its peak this year and 55 percent since Donald J. Trump was elected president.That left tech stocks vulnerable to a sharp sell-off.That\u2019s why the declines in shares of companies like Netflix and Amazon this month say more about their stock market valuations than the state of the wider economy.Earlier this year, Netflix was trading at 110 times the earnings Wall Street analysts expected the company to make over the next 12 months, according to FactSet. That multiple is many times that of the wider market and suggests that investors were confident Netflix would deliver on its ambitious goals. But big questions, including its ability to finance its growth and rising competition, hang over the company. The drop in Netflix\u2019s stock is thus evidence of healthy skepticism, rather than kneejerk bearishness about its future.But other selling cannot be so easily shrugged off.Bank stocks are down a lot this year. That\u2019s despite a strong economy, which typically leads to increased lending activity; rising interest rates, which have bolstered the profitability of banks\u2019 core lending business; the tax cuts enacted last year, which had an outsize effect on bank profits; and hopes for deregulation. Yet the shares of Citigroup, the nation\u2019s third largest bank, are down nearly 20 percent from their high earlier this year. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are all down about 15 percent this year.If bank stocks are a barometer for the economy, their poor performance points to some of the questions that keep investors up at night. Will President Trump\u2019s trade war soon start to do real damage to corporate earnings and the global economy? Will the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases crimp economic activity by depriving companies and households of the loans they need to finance purchases?A rout helps investors decide what\u2019s worth really worrying about. With the United States economy growing strongly, they may soon decide they\u2019ve been freaking out too much. A sustained upturn in bank stocks may show that their optimism is returning. But if they remain in the doldrums, real trouble may lie ahead.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I.R.S. Tax Fraud Cases Plummet After Budget Cuts", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTax evasion is at the center of the criminal cases against two associates of the president, Paul Manafort and Michael D. Cohen. The sheer scale of their efforts to avoid paying the government has given rise to a head-scratching question: How were they able to cheat the Internal Revenue Service for so many years?The answer, researchers and former government auditors say, is simple. The I.R.S. pursues fewer cases of tax evasion than it did less than 10 years ago. Provided you\u2019re not a close associate of President Trump, there may never be a better time to be a tax cheat.Last year, the I.R.S.\u2019s criminal division brought 795 cases in which tax fraud was the primary crime, a decline of almost a quarter since 2010. \u201cThat is a startling number,\u201d Don Fort, the chief of criminal investigations for the I.R.S., acknowledged at a New York University tax conference in June.Bringing cases against people who evade taxes on legal income is central to the revenue service\u2019s mission. In addition to recouping lost revenue, such cases are supposed \u201cto influence taxpayer behavior for the hundreds of millions of American citizens filing tax returns,\u201d Mr. Fort said. With fewer cases, experts fear, Americans will get the message that it\u2019s all right to break the law.Starting in 2011, Republicans in Congress repeatedly cut the I.R.S.\u2019s budget, forcing the agency to reduce its enforcement staff by a third. But that drop doesn\u2019t entirely explain the reduction in tax fraud cases.Over time, crimes only tangentially related to taxes, such as drug trafficking and money laundering, have come to account for most of the agency\u2019s cases.\u201cDue to budget cuts, attrition and a shift in focus, there\u2019s been a collapse in the commitment to take on tax fraud,\u201d said Chuck Pine, who used to be the third-ranking criminal enforcement officer at the I.R.S. and is now a managing director at BDO Consulting. \u201cI believe there are thousands of individuals who have U.S. tax obligations and are not complying with U.S. tax laws.\u201dThe I.R.S. declined to comment on its enforcement efforts.Mr. Cohen\u2019s and Mr. Manafort\u2019s cases illustrate different but common types of tax cheating, and how the I.R.S. has struggled to enforce the law. Mr. Cohen failed to report income from domestic businesses. Mr. Manafort used foreign locales and shell corporations to hide his money.The I.R.S. typically catches such evasion by auditing taxpayers. Theoretically, evidence picked up in audits can be used to start criminal cases.\u201cThe focus of auditors and tax collectors is not to identify fraud, it\u2019s to collect tax,\u201d said a special agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Management has set other priorities, the agent said, \u201cso by default, the employees are not doing it.\u201dIn addition, current and former I.R.S. agents say audits are not as intensive as they used to be. Because the I.R.S. pushes agents to close audits more quickly, they make fewer requests for records and interviews.50thousand4033,20030Enforcement staff 20Includes examinations and collections personnel as well as special agents.100\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u2019171.0%0.80.60.5%Audit rate0.4Includes individual and business tax returns.0.20\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u20191750thousand1.0%400.833,200300.6Audit rateEnforcement staff 0.5%Includes examinations and collections personnel as well as special agents.Includes individual and business tax returns.200.4100.200\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201917\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201917Source: Internal Revenue Service\u201cThe quality of those referrals was also down,\u201d said Marie Allen, a recently retired auditor who worked at the I.R.S. for more than 30 years conducting complex financial investigations. \u201cThat is what people popularly think we should be doing, and I\u2019m trying to say it ain\u2019t so.\u201dBudget cuts have diminished the criminal investigation division, trimming the number of agents by a fifth since 2010. Recently, the I.R.S. closed four of its 25 field offices, according to Mr. Fort. In New York State, home of the country\u2019s financial industry, the revenue service is down to 161 agents, about a hundred fewer than it had 15 years ago.It doesn\u2019t help that many agents prefer chasing flashier crimes than tax evasion. Rob Warren, a research associate at Catholic University who previously spent a quarter-century at the I.R.S., interviewed 30 former special agents. He asked them which of their cases had been their favorite. The answers, Mr. Warren said, typically were only tangentially related to taxes.\u201cIt was usually narcotics, Ponzi schemes, some public corruption,\u201d he said. \u201cAgents loved Ponzi cases because there was a real victim, an old lady or something like that.\u201dFederal prosecutors seek out special agents for these cases because they are skilled financial investigators. And tax crimes, like failing to declare illegal income from, say, a bribe or cocaine sales, can be easier to prove than bribery or drug trafficking.In recent years, the I.R.S. has also been pulled away from classic tax-dodging cases by soaring rates of identity theft. I.R.S. management assigned scores of agents to chase perpetrators who used stolen identities to collect tax refunds.One tax fraud hotbed that has been a clear priority of both the I.R.S. and the Justice Department is going after money Americans stashed overseas without reporting it to the federal government. But there are clear reasons that Mr. Manafort, who hid his money in places like Cyprus and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, might still have escaped detection.\u201cWhat has happened over the last 10 years is real progress,\u201d Dr. Zucman said. \u201cBut what the data suggest is that it has not had a dramatic effect on the amount of offshore wealth.\u201d Money has flowed out of Switzerland and into Asian tax havens like Hong Kong and Singapore.Moreover, the I.R.S. has made little use of new weapons in the fight against wealth hidden overseas. In 2010, President Barack Obama signed a law that was supposed to provide a crucial tool for government auditors and prosecutors. That law, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, required banks with American account holders to report information to the United States. Like W-2 forms that employers file to tell about their workers, these reports would force account holders to come clean.The report found serious problems with the millions of records collected so far. About half, for example, didn\u2019t include identification numbers for the taxpayers, making it difficult to match the accounts with individuals. The I.R.S. hadn\u2019t set up a process for using the records. The agency said it was working on such a system.Here, too, the cuts to the I.R.S.\u2019s budget have had an impact. During the Obama administration, the I.R.S. asked Congress for hundreds of millions of dollars to carry out the program, but received nothing. Since Mr. Trump took office, the agency has stopped asking.Jesse Eisinger and Paul Kiel are reporters for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest.Advertisement"}

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.Whenever I travel for a story, I love to watch the local news. Right now, I\u2019m in Little Rock, Ark., doing some reporting (more on that to come), and as in a lot of places, I find myself bombarded by political ads.Honestly, Arkansas isn\u2019t that bad because there just aren\u2019t many tight races down here this year. But I was curious who was getting the worst of the political ad assault.So, we asked our friends at the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks and analyzes ad spending, to sort out which Senate and House races had seen the most ads this cycle.In the Senate:In the House:Two things to keep in mind when you look at these numbers: First, we focused on the number of times an ad aired rather than the total amount spent. That\u2019s because the costs can vary so much by location. For example, an ad in New Jersey, which hits the pricey New York and Philadelphia media markets, is far more expensive to air than a spot in, say, Montana.Second, two House races \u2014 Georgia and Montana \u2014 had special elections in this election cycle, which were counted in the total. That helps explain why they top the list.While I watch TV on the road, I\u2019m a proud cord-cutter at home. Can\u2019t say these numbers make me regret my decision! But, I\u2019m always open to being wrong. If there are any fans of political ads out there, we\u2019re all ears. Tell us why you love television\u2019s most contentious time of year.____________________Earlier this week, we asked you to tell us the local issues that you\u2019re thinking about, and voting on, in November. We\u2019ve gotten some great responses already, but we want to hear from even more of you.____________________There\u2019s been a bounty of polling in the New Jersey Senate race this month, and the whiplash variations have shown Senator Robert Menendez and Bob Hugin, his Republican challenger, in everything from a statistical tie to an 11-point lead for Mr. Menendez.It\u2019s enough to confuse even the sharpest political observer. Just ask Senator Chuck Schumer.On Tuesday, Senate Majority PAC, the principal super PAC supporting Democratic efforts in the Senate, directed by Mr. Schumer, announced it was investing $3 million in the deeply blue Garden State to support Mr. Menendez.Some political observers began to wonder if Mr. Schumer erred in investing the $3 million in a state that hasn\u2019t elected a Republican to the Senate since 1972.We\u2019re not entirely sure.Despite his apparent lead, Mr. Menendez has maintained significant unfavorable ratings. The Monmouth poll, for example, had him at 28 percent favorable and 45 percent unfavorable (what pollsters often call \u201cunderwater.\u201d)A few New Jersey Democratic political operatives I spoke to this morning said they cannot remember a single race where a candidate who was that \u201cunderwater\u201d maintained a significant lead.____________________You can find more opinion pieces on politics here.____________________You can see all our polling here._________________________________________________________________________________Isabella Grull\u00f3n Paz and Margaret Kramer contributed to this newsletter.Thanks for reading.

But those hoping to escape any tarnish from attending Saudi Arabia\u2019s global investment conference in the wake of a dissident journalist\u2019s killing were foiled when the crown prince himself, Mohammed bin Salman, appeared at the summit meeting and received a standing ovation.Many Western executives and government officials have canceled their appearances, including the chief executives of Blackstone Group, JPMorgan Chase, and foreign and finance ministers from the United States, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.Still, more than 3,000 people are attending the three-day conference this week and, on the first day, the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton buzzed as executives glided across the marble floors, sipping kiwi juice, exchanging business cards and discussing potential deals.Some were not in the mood for conversation; others likened the decision about whether to attend to a Hobson\u2019s choice.\u201cI\u2019m not doing any media,\u201d said Ken Moelis, the founder and chief executive of Moelis & Company, an investment bank. \u201cIt\u2019ll have to be \u2018no comment.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s awkward,\u201d said Tally Zingher, chief executive of Dawsat, a start-up company focused on health in the Middle East, who noted the shadow cast by Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death.Ms. Zingher, an American, considered not attending, but decided that she was not prominent enough to make a statement by skipping the conference.Henry Biner, an executive at the Boston-based P/E Investments, said that Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing was \u201chorrendous\u201d but that there were wars and atrocities occurring across the Middle East and that the situation should not necessarily deter business ties.\u201cOne year from now, somebody is going to ask where the revenue is,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to put our relationships on the line for this.\u201dThe decision of whether to attend the investment conference has presented a particular dilemma for financial companies, many of which have multibillion-dollar ties to Saudi Arabia, employ workers in the region and are eager to maintain strong relations there.Morgan Stanley has been advising Saudi officials on their planned initial public offering of stock in Saudi Aramco, the national oil company. JPMorgan Chase has a leading spot as an underwriter for the I.P.O. and employs 70 people in Riyadh. Citigroup\u2019s chief executive, Michael Corbat, unveiled the bank\u2019s newest Riyadh office at a festive ribbon-cutting ceremony this year.Blackstone Group has teamed up with the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund to start a planned $40 billion infrastructure investment fund, focusing on the United States.None of the big Wall Street firms sent their top leaders, but institutions such as Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley sent local and regional executives, some of whom are senior in stature. No one from Blackstone Group, whose chief executive withdrew from the event last week, attended, according to a company official.Some who did attend said they were there just to do business and dismissed the Khashoggi situation.\u201cIt\u2019s just noise to me,\u201d said Michael Slater, who runs the Middle East and Africa investment business for Northern Trust and is based in Riyadh. \u201cThe people I need to see are here, and that\u2019s what I care about.\u201dThe future of the investment conference remains uncertain, and some attendees mingling on the sidelines wondered aloud whether the current crisis would blow over or result in a real reversal of Saudi Arabia\u2019s recent progress. For Saudis who organized the conference, one question that was top of mind was whether corporate media sponsors that withdrew their support, including The New York Times Company, would return next year.An investment adviser who specializes in business deals between the United States and Saudi Arabia suggested that big banks with brands to protect and Silicon Valley companies that promote ethical investing would be wary of embarking on new deals with Saudi Arabia until concerns about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing were resolved.Real estate investors from the United States, however, were eagerly prowling the halls, seeking funding for projects in America and looking for opportunities to get involved in infrastructure development in the Middle East.And in a demonstration of its continued attractiveness as an investment partner, Saudi Aramco announced the signing of 15 deals worth more than $30 billion with companies in eight countries: the United States, France, China, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, South Korea and India.At least several of the deals were preliminary memorandums of understanding, which is the first formal step toward a final contract, but they were highly symbolic amid Saudi efforts to avoid financial and political isolation.Among the deals was one in which the French oil giant Total agreed to begin engineering studies for the eventual building of a petrochemical complex. Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes agreed to work on a gas power plant.With its image as a modernizing economic powerhouse tarnished in recent weeks, Saudi officials were not subtle in their efforts to remind the world of the country\u2019s resources.During one of the panel discussions on Tuesday, Amin Nasser, Aramco\u2019s chief executive, made clear that Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to produce oil remained unmatched.\u201cOur capacity can be sustained for a long time, backed by among the largest reserves in the world, with the highest quality and the lowest cost of production,\u201d he said.Saudi leaders appearing at the finance conference tried to distance themselves and their nation from the killing.As global business leaders and government delegations filed into the heavily fortified hotel in Riyadh, one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s most powerful executives and an adviser to its Public Investment Fund paid her respects to Mr. Khashoggi and said that reports of his grisly killing did not define her country.\u201cThe terrible acts reported in recent weeks are alien to our culture and our DNA,\u201d said Lubna S. Olayan, the deputy chairwoman of the Olayan Financing Company and the first speaker at the event.Ms. Olayan, a billionaire and one of the richest people in Saudi Arabia, said she was confident that \u201cthe truth will emerge\u201d about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fate, and she thanked the foreigners who attended the conference under the circumstances.\u201cI am sure we will grow and emerge stronger as a result of dealing with the crisis of the last few weeks,\u201d she said.After an uncomfortable silence, the packed ballroom applauded.\u201cFrom the leadership on down, we\u2019re very upset about what has happened,\u201d said Khalid al-Falih, the energy minister, who described Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing as \u201cabhorrent\u201d and promised that an investigation would yield justice and retribution.While many European and American officials boycotted the conference, the prime minister of Pakistan and the king of Jordan spoke.Veterans of last year\u2019s gathering said it appeared that there were more Saudis in attendance this year, leading some to suggest that the organizers scrambled to fill empty seats. They also noted there were more Russian and Asian executives, perhaps trying to capitalize on less competition for deals from Western investors.The absence of American broadcast media was also apparent, as the bright lights of CNBC and Fox Business that were centerpieces of last year\u2019s event were replaced by more modest production sets for London\u2019s Sky News and RT, the television network funded by the Russian government.Kate Kelly contributed reporting from New York, and Clifford Krauss from Houston.Advertisement"}

Here Are Some Names That Stand Out", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 Chancellor Angela Merkel has reigned as Germany\u2019s \u2014 and often Europe\u2019s \u2014 leading political power for 13 years. But within hours of her announcement on Monday that she would step down this year as leader of her conservative party, focus had shifted to who could possibly replace her.Whoever is elected to lead the Christian Democrats after Ms. Merkel would be well positioned to eventually succeed her as Germany\u2019s leader, as well, greatly raising the stakes in the December contest. As the power struggle shapes up, here are some of the potential candidates:Earlier this year, the Christian Democrats elected Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer party secretary-general \u2014 the post Ms. Merkel once used as a steppingstone to the top position \u2014 with a mandate to rejuvenate the party. She is expected to run for the party leadership in December.The former governor of the tiny state of Saarland, Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer is also believed to be the person the chancellor would most like to see succeed her, and the pair have shown that they can collaborate while maintaining separate political profiles. Ms. Kramp-Karrenbauer, whose unwieldy last name is often shortened to her initials, A.K.K., enjoys support in the party\u2019s conservative ranks, where she is admired for her Roman Catholic family values, as well as from centrists.In 2002, Mr. Spahn became the youngest member to be directly elected to Parliament, and then earned a seat on the conservative party\u2019s governing board. He has made a name for himself by attacking the chancellor on laws approving dual citizenship and English-speaking staff working in cafes in the German capital. Since becoming health minister, he has taken on more serious issues, focusing on care for the sick and the frail.Mr. Laschet, 57, is already a deputy party leader, and last year was elected leader of Germany\u2019s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, winning control from the Social Democrats.Once a rival of Ms. Merkel, Friedrich Merz rose to prominence in the party alongside her, as an older group of leaders was toppled by a campaign finance scandal.But he quit politics altogether after Ms. Merkel pushed him out as the head of the conservative group in Parliament in 2002.Mr. Merz, now 62, went on to become head of Germany for BlackRock, which is generally considered the largest private fund manager, and a senior counsel in D\u00fcsseldorf at Mayer Brown, an international law firm.The conservatives called him back into politics in 2014 to serve on an internal commission aimed at strengthening society. Last year, Mr. Laschet appointed him to a nonpaid position as Brexit commissioner for North-Rhine Westphalia.The state is seeking to position itself as a relocation magnet for businesses that may leave Britain when it exits the European Union.An earlier version of this article misstated who was the youngest member of Parliament in 2002. Jens Spahn was the youngest member to be directly elected to Parliament, but a younger member entered Parliament through a party list.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mark Hoplamazian of Hyatt Hotels on Airbnb and Why Stupid Questions Are Smart", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "Corner officeA lifer within the Pritzker organization, Mr. Hoplamazian reorganized the family business during an acrimonious feud, then took over the hotel chain.Supported byMark Hoplamazian, the chief executive of Hyatt Hotels, has worked for one family for the bulk of his professional career.He attended Harvard College and got his M.B.A. at the University of Chicago. After short stints at First Boston and the Boston Consulting Group, he joined the Pritzker family\u2019s sprawling business empire in 1989. Inside the Pritzker organization, Mr. Hoplamazian got an intense and varied introduction to business, working closely with Jay Pritzker, the family\u2019s influential patriarch, on companies including Hyatt Hotels and the industrial behemoth Marmon.But in the years after Mr. Pritzker\u2019s death in 1999, a family feud erupted, and it fell to Mr. Hoplamazian and his team to dismantle the Pritzker empire and try to appease warring factions. Eventually, Mr. Hoplamazian was made C.E.O. of Hyatt. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at the Hyatt Centric Times Square in New York City. What did your parents do? What was your first job? In the landscaping business, there are many different things you can do even as a kid \u2014 taking ivy cuttings and planting them in little peat pots to let them grow, digging trees, a lot of physical work. That\u2019s what I would do for summers and on weekends from the time I was 10, or even younger. I was driving tractors and trucks when I was 13, 14 and 15 years old.Is that legal? No. In fact, when I was 15, the first time I ever drove a truck on the road there was an amazing blizzard. It was 1978, I\u2019ll never forget it. It hit the whole East Coast. My brother had a contract to clear snow at this huge parking lot area, but he needed someone to drive one of the trucks over there to have it be available. He said, \u201cJust get in the truck. I know you can drive it, because you\u2019ve been driving around the nursery. Just follow me.\u201d We get on the road, and there was so much snow, and I\u2019m driving illegally at that time. The good news is, there was nobody else on the road.How did you wind up joining the Pritzker organization? A friend of mine was working with them, and I got a call from him. He said, \u201cSo we\u2019ve decided that we\u2019re going to probably hire someone of your experience level. Why don\u2019t you come in and meet Jay?\u201d I show up, and sitting at the table was Jay, the head of the machinist union at Eastern Airlines and his lawyer. Eastern was in bankruptcy, and so they were there pitching Jay on stepping in to take over the airline. At the end of that first meeting, Jay hands me the box of information they brought, and this was on a Tuesday. He said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back on Friday and tell me what you think we should do?\u201d I didn't know anything about airlines, and I knew even less about bankruptcy. That was my interview.So what happened? I came back on Friday, and I fumbled around, I guess, well enough for him to say, \u201cO.K., the kid\u2019s not a complete idiot.\u201d Jay elected not to move forward with it.When you joined the Pritzker organization, what did they have you do? Their portfolio was very wide and broad. But it was a tiny organization, so the stuff that I was involved with was everything from selecting members of management teams to negotiating operating contracts for businesses and then doing financing. It was like up and down the functional dimensions and across many different businesses. It was great, diverse kind of business experience.How did you develop as a leader during this time, especially given that the organization was pretty small? There was a highly complicated deal that we did in joint venture with an Israeli company to launch a new business jet. Wildly complicated transaction. It was my deal. Jay basically said, \u201cGo see if you can make something work out of this.\u201d It was very, very, very challenging. There was lots of internal opposition. It was really a lesson in perseverance. I had to say, \u201cNo, actually, I believe in this, and I think I can get this done. I\u2019m going to compel myself to get it done even in the face of a whole bunch of opposition.\u201d Ultimately it was a very successful deal. And my position in the organization changed after that. When you walk through that barrier, you have a different sort of posture with a lot of other people. You were there when the Pritzker family sort of unraveled. In the case of the Pritzkers, I describe them as sort of like communists in some ways because it was definitely a collective effort. Jay\u2019s whole philosophy was: I\u2019m here helping the entirety of the family advance. It wasn\u2019t about my personal wealth versus others\u2019. In fact, the whole structure was a complicated trust structure for the benefit of all the family members. That is really the fundamental thing that changed when the food fight hit. The assertions were about lack of transparency and understanding how all this stuff actually worked. Most family-owned companies fall apart after the third or fourth generation because you have people who are involved in the business, and then a whole bunch of people who aren\u2019t. What was your role in the whole affair? Our group was responsible for mapping out how we were going to unwind the entire portfolio. We were holding these family meetings where all the principal beneficiary groups were coming together. There were more lawyers in the room than there were family members. It was like having the first annual meeting of an enterprise that was three generations old at that time, and I was the M.C. I had to stand up in front of the entirety of the family and lead the meetings. I did that for five successive years until I left to go join Hyatt. Then you started running Hyatt. What was it like moving from a small family business to a big company? It was pretty intimidating in some ways. I came into the business, and I was pretty ignorant. I knew a lot about the financial and tax structure of Hyatt because I had helped put the company together in the whole family reorganization. But I didn\u2019t really know the business; I didn\u2019t grow up in the business. That level of ignorance was super powerful because it just let me ask a whole bunch of stupid questions, which served me extremely well. Those simple questions often led to interesting discussions about why we do certain things the way we do, and that led to changes. But it was organic as opposed to me coming in thinking that I knew better. It was actually the result of inquiry.What\u2019s the biggest challenge facing the hotel industry today?The sharing economy is one. Of course, Airbnb is like the poster child for that because they have grown so quickly. The lesson for us in Airbnb when they first started was that a lot of what that customer experience was about was the attractive human interface between a guest and a real human being on the other side, not a trained professional. But the company has evolved. No longer is it typical that you\u2019re renting Aunt Millie and Uncle Ed\u2019s apartment, but it\u2019s Industrial Apartment L.L.C. #5 with 45 units in a building. It\u2019s become very institutional.I think Airbnb spurred a lot of focus around purpose and empathy and care as the cornerstone for why we existed, and from that perspective I think it\u2019s been great, because that\u2019s been tremendously beneficial in leading the company since then.You use the word empathy a lot. What are you getting at? We\u2019ve focused a lot of time and attention on mindfulness as a key capacity. In order to practice empathy, you have to be present, and one great vehicle to being present is to be mindful. Mindfulness became the central element of our wellness investment. Miraval and Exhale, our two brands that we bought, their foundations are around mindfulness, a mindful approach to nutrition, yoga, fitness, you name it. To me, first and foremost, I want people to be present, to be able to engage and really glean what\u2019s going on with someone. Don\u2019t be so focused on executing the checklist and the services that you\u2019re supposed to provide to them that you\u2019re skipping over what\u2019s really going on with that person.It\u2019s actually one of the things that we can do that is maybe not unique to our industry, but powerfully enabled by our industry. That is, bringing people with low skill sets into a vocational path that allows them to advance and have a career. One of the key problems in the United States, and actually this is a global phenomenon, is you have a large and growing number of people who are essentially disenfranchised. They\u2019re young people who are out of school and out of work. To me, this is the area of focus that we should apply ourselves to from a philanthropic effort, but also from a fulfillment of our purpose perspective. Bringing more and more people out of that community into our industry is something that we\u2019re focused on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Great Ad. Compelling Characters. But No Mass Audience for the Democratic Candidates.", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 It is one of the more compelling ads of the midterm election cycle, a 60-second video featuring eight Democratic women running for House seats, reciting their backgrounds in either the military or intelligence services as the predicate for their first runs for political office. Bruce Springsteen\u2019s anthemic \u201cThe Rising\u201d soars in the background.And it may never be aired on television.The political action committee that created it, Serve America, led by Representative Seth Moulton, Democrat of Massachusetts and a Marine veteran, is structured in a way that caps donations to individual candidates at $5,000 per election. Since it has already given the maximum allowable contribution to the campaigns and coordinated the ad with each of the candidates featured, paying to promote additional television or digital ads would violate likely campaign finance laws.\u201cWould I like several million people to see it? Yeah, absolutely,\u201d Mr. Moulton said.Will they? Probably not.So like an author with a well-reviewed novel, Mr. Moulton may have to be content with the praise, if not the audience. None of the eight candidates featured is likely to get a major boost.\u201cIt\u2019s powerful because they are co-opting the old Republican faith, flag and military themes and it gives them a credential outside of politics, which is attractive,\u201d said Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist, who added, \u201cThere is an emotional impact of seeing so many of them.\u201dThe only hope for a truly broad audience is a bet that the video goes viral online. While it has had over one million views so far on a combination of Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter, according to Serve America, it has not come close to the audience that one of the women featured in the ad, M.J. Hegar, a Democratic House candidate in Texas, achieved with her own viral ad. That one has been viewed close to three million times on YouTube alone.Political advertising, while still wedded in many ways to traditional television, has evolved, and the internet offers a very low-cost alternative. A number of celebrities, like Mr. Springsteen, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Garner, Sara Bareilles, Judd Apatow, Jennifer Garner, Amy Schumer, Seth Meyers and Chelsea Handler, have shared the Serve America video on their social networks.Serve America and the candidates have received at least some contributions from the effort, but there is no way to gauge whether it spurred people to register or vote.\u201cIt\u2019s not targeted to any one particular district or group of people,\u201d Mr. Moulton said. \u201cWe just want Americans to know that there are amazing leaders running for office and these women are such shining examples of that.\u201dThe only way the ad can actually reach television would be through another group, like the Democratic Party, deciding to sponsor it.Mr. Moulton said the party could do more to support the candidates featured in the ads. \u201cI believe that as Democrats, if we want to start winning again, we need to start leading again,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are tough races. Yet these are extraordinary candidates in really tough districts.\u201dBut at least some of the candidates are hardly struggling for campaign funds. Amy McGrath, a former Marine combat aviator and Democratic House candidate in Kentucky, and Abigail Spanberger, a former C.I.A. operative and candidate in Virginia, each raised more than $3.6 million in the last quarter. Another, Chrissy Houlahan, running in Pennsylvania\u2019s redrawn Sixth District, is considered a strong favorite, with or without the help.Veteran political strategists said the video had a collective power, using a patriotic appeal to vote, without any overt partisan pitch. There is also a clear tonal diversion from the harshly negative ads that most voters are seeing in the closing days before the election.\u201cIf Democrats are going to take back the House, if all you do is slam Republicans, that\u2019s probably not going to get you over the line, particularly at a time like this when so viciously negative,\u201d said Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist. \u201cShowing women who are patriots, who are less partisan, and who are clearly motivated by public interest, I just think it\u2019s great and exactly what people want.\u201cIt\u2019s a balm for the soul when everyone else is throwing bombs,\u201d he added.And it is not an accident that all of the candidates featured in the ad are women, in a year with a record number of women running for office. \u201cVery powerful message that works on multiple levels,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, a Republican political consultant who has worked on dozens of Senate and presidential campaigns. \u201cAs much about voting for women as voting for those who have served.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Biggest Buyers of American Stocks Are on the Sidelines Right Now", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerican companies are the largest source of demand for American stocks, and sharp tumbles have come when their buying slows. Another element worth considering? The biggest buyers probably aren\u2019t buying. It may seem counterintuitive, but the largest single source of demand for American stocks is the American companies that issue them. Companies are on track to repurchase more than $770 billion in their own stock this year, according to research from Goldman Sachs. That\u2019s more than twice the size of the next largest source of demand, exchange-traded funds, which last year bought $347 billion in shares. But those companies are getting ready to report earnings, an event that is preceded by a regular slowdown in buyback activity. Some large market dips in the past year have coincided with these quarterly slowdowns. Keith Parker, head of United States equity research at UBS Investment Research, said the market has been weaker when buybacks have slowed. \u201cWhen that dries up or slows significantly, you\u2019re having outsized market effects,\u201d he said. When companies have more cash than they believe they can use productively, they typically return it to shareholders either with cash payments \u2014 known as dividends \u2014 or by repurchasing shares in the market. Buybacks raise demand, putting upward pressure on share prices.Such repurchases have boomed this year as the strong economy \u2014 and steep cuts in corporate tax rates \u2014 have left American companies flush with profits. Companies including Apple, Cisco Systems and Amgen have returned billions in cash to shareholders by buying back shares. Apple is responsible for the largest sum, spending nearly $64 billion on buybacks in the 12 months ending in June 2018, the last period for which full data is available, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.But corporate buybacks regularly slow around the start of the earnings reporting season, because companies want to avoid any potential legal risks from buying stock ahead of publishing their financial results. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out there buying stock if you know good news is about to come out and the market doesn\u2019t know it,\u201d said Charles Elson, a professor of finance and corporate governance at the University of Delaware. This year, periods of reduced buyback activity have, at times, been accompanied by sharp sell-offs in stock markets. Around the time when buybacks dried up in late January, according to UBS data, the S.&P. 500 suffered an ugly drop, falling more than 10 percent from a record high. The market stabilized alongside corporate buying in early February. Likewise, a buyback slowdown in April was accompanied by a tumble in stocks. The stock market\u2019s capricious behavior cannot be traced to a single factor, of course. But a slowdown in buybacks effectively removes a lot of motivated buyers from the American exchanges, which might have been a stabilizing force.\u201cNo one else buys back share proportionately anything like the U.S.,\u201d said Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a uniquely U.S. phenomenon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "These Funds Aim to Power Their Returns With Clean Energy", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you worry about climate change and have some money to spare, it\u2019s natural to wonder whether investing in green energy might plump your returns while helping to stem rising temperatures.A growing number of stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds specialize in the so-called green- or clean-energy industry. They invest not only in the expected companies, like generators of solar and wind power and their suppliers, but also in less obvious ones, like makers of LED light bulbs, electric cars and automobile batteries.Buying into one of these funds means betting on a burgeoning, if volatile, sector and pinning the green in your wallet to your hopes for a more verdant future.Demand for renewable energy is surging, according to the International Energy Agency, a nongovernmental organization based in Paris. As a result, growth in solar- and wind-powered electricity generation is far outstripping that of coal- and natural-gas-fueled generation, the group said in its \u201cRenewables 2017\u201d report. China\u2019s embrace of solar power has been the main engine for this growth, but the United States is the second-strongest market for renewables, the agency said.Even the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett has taken steps toward going green: MidAmerican Energy, one of the subsidiaries of his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, is aiming to obtain 100 percent of its electricity from wind power by 2020.\u201cDecarbonization is a huge and enduring trend, and it\u2019s being led by the private sector now, like Facebook going 100 percent renewable,\u201d said Pavel S. Molchanov, a senior vice president and energy analyst with Raymond James, the financial services company. In August, Facebook, too, announced that it was striving to power its operations with renewables by the end of 2020.But whether investors in mutual funds and E.T.F.s have any effect on the choices being made by companies like Facebook and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a subject of debate among investment experts and fund managers.Mr. Molchanov counts himself among the skeptics. \u201cIf a person sells a coal stock, someone is going to buy it,\u201d he said. \u201cWill that action lead to less coal being burned? No. For someone to contribute to decarbonization, the way they can do it is by putting solar on their rooftop.\u201dSome managers of green-energy funds disagree, saying individual investments do help the energy transition, even if they don\u2019t lead to the shuttering of a coal-fired power plant tomorrow.By signaling consumer interest, investment in these companies also can create a virtuous cycle, potentially pulling in even more money, said Jeff Waller, a principal in the global climate finance group at Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Colorado. \u201cYou\u2019re demonstrating there\u2019s demand from the average investor,\u201d he said. \u201cPension funds and 401(k) managers will want to meet that demand. That can create a larger pool of capital focused on this market, which can only help.\u201dJon F. Hale, global head of sustainability research for Morningstar, likened an individual\u2019s green energy bets to \u201cvoting with your money.\u201d Those sorts of \u201cvotes\u201d can embolden fund companies to offer more products and be more aggressive in supporting and even pushing for corporate environmental investments and initiatives.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had the philosophy that the fund exists to build a green energy future,\u201d said Murray D. Rosenblith, one of the portfolio managers of New Alternatives. Mr. Rosenblith said he joined his co-manager, David J. Schoenwald, who founded New Alternatives with his father, in the belief that the fund was contributing to the advancement of renewable energy. \u201cI was a peace activist and had run a charitable foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have come here if I didn\u2019t believe we were helping.\u201dOver the five years ending on Sept. 28, Fidelity\u2019s fund returned an annualized average of 9.75 percent and New Alternatives 6.73 percent, compared with an annualized average of 13.95 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Calvert opted to go its own way because it judged many of the existing indexes to be too concentrated, Ms. Huang said. The WilderHill index contains 39 stocks and the S.&P. index 29, compared with more than 150 for Calvert\u2019s index. \u201cSo we\u2019re offering a product that\u2019s more diversified but still addresses the energy crisis,\u201d she said.No standard recipe exists for what a renewable energy fund should contain. Some funds broaden their potential pool of holdings by including a salmagundi of stocks.Take Fidelity. Its fund can \u201clook at any company out there trying to push for environmental change in its industry,\u201d said its manager, Kevin G. Walenta. Only about half of its assets are dedicated to renewable energy and energy efficiency stocks. The fund also contains waste-management, water and agricultural holdings. That broad remit suits Mr. Walenta, who said he prefers to invest in longstanding companies and shies away from newer technologies.Energy efficiency, in particular, is a favored theme. \u201cThe payback period for efficiency investments gets better every year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the companies have brand power and long histories of positive economic profits.\u201d As an example, he pointed to Ingersoll Rand, a more-than-a-century-old manufacturer that makes efficient heating and air-conditioning systems. It has lately been one of the fund\u2019s top holdings.Mr. Hale, of Morningstar, said an investor shouldn\u2019t let concern about climate change be all that determines the amount of an investment in renewable energy. A green-energy fund or E.T.F. can supplement a diversified portfolio, with, say, a 5 percent or 10 percent allocation, but it does not take the place of a core holding, he said.A concern when considering such an investment might be the climate-change skepticism of the Trump administration. The solar- and wind-power industries are supported by federal tax credits. And the president likes to talk up coal, and he pulled the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement, the international accord through which countries worldwide committed to goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If the Trump administration were to push for further changes in federal energy policy, that might hurt renewables.But Lucas White, manager of the GMO Climate Change Fund, said doings in Washington no longer bedevil wind and solar power all that much, as the industries are now mature enough that federal support isn\u2019t crucial for their growth. (Mr. White\u2019s fund, with a minimum initial investment of $10 million, is intended for institutional investors, like pension funds.) \u201cCosts have come down much faster than anyone thought was possible,\u201d he said.Mr. White noted that James L. Robo, chief executive of NextEra Energy, one of the country\u2019s largest power generators, has predicted that solar and wind power will be cheaper than coal or nuclear generation by the beginning of the next decade. \u201cWhen that happens, that\u2019s a massive change in the global energy landscape,\u201d Mr. White said.He is also among those who say that fund and E.T.F. investments can help green energy producers and other companies involved in climate-change mitigation and adaptation.\u201cThis may sound a little squishy, but if no one was willing to invest in these companies, they wouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jennifer Lopez on Her Power Bossness, \u2018Second Act\u2019 and A-Rod", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "With a new movie and numerous other deals in the works, the star has come to realize Hollywood hasn\u2019t given her her fair share. Now she\u2019s fixing that.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 It was supposed to be Jennifer Lopez\u2019s day off. Cue visions of her lounging by her infinity pool in Bel-Air, friends hanging, tunes turned up. Instead, Lopez, the multihyphenate performer, producer and branding maven, held a half-dozen business meetings in her home here, from early morning until sundown, on ambitious ventures ranging from real estate to fitness.A studio head was there, some developer types, marketing people, her TV and film producing partner, her manager and Alex Rodriguez, her boyfriend. The couple were hoping to have dinner together, but \u201cyou see what goes on around here,\u201d she said, unapologetically, as they went over the day\u2019s agenda.A gracious Bel-Air mansion \u2014 complete with mini-waterfalls (yes, plural), fireplaces blazing in even empty rooms, and two bunnies that belong to Lopez\u2019s 10-year-old twins \u2014 might seem an unlikely spot to transform into a C-suite. But when Lopez moved in two years ago, she designed an office like a boardroom, complete with big conference table. It just happens to be next to the couture-filled space where she gets her hair and makeup done. And so she whisks in, half-dolled up, to present her opinions and outsize ideas, and she sells them: J. Lo Inc., in action.And now, at the end of this non-day off, she strode over on four-inch glossy Louboutins, with the posture of an equestrian and a C.E.O.\u2019s firm handshake, to crisply discuss how her latest movie, \u201cSecond Act,\u201d fits into her new entrepreneurial strategy. It all hinges on an acknowledgment of her power bossness.To hear her tell it, that stance has been hard-won. Over the last few years, as a divorced parent, she took painstaking stock of her trajectory, and decided she could level up.\u201cUnderstanding my own worth and value as a person made me understand it differently in my work, as well,\u201d she said. It \u201chas been a long journey for me. And so I\u2019m very proud to stand in the shoes of, yes, I think I do deserve more. All artists do deserve more. We are the scarce asset. They can\u2019t do anything without us. They have no product. So we have to understand that.\u201dThat Lopez now openly mentions private equity as breezily as other actresses discuss character development may be thanks to Rodriguez, 43. The Yankee-turned-sports commentator is a longtime investor with a sizable real estate portfolio spread across 14 states \u2014 A-Rod Inc. He had organized several of her meetings that day, and some for himself.To anyone who has crossed paths with Lopez since, her determination is unmissable. \u201cShe is the master of shattering the word \u2018no,\u2019\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d He reeled off her career transitions \u2014 dancer to actor, actor to singer, to producer, to businesswoman, opposition at each step. \u201cShe keeps breaking through,\u201d he said, sounding awed. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the most powerful brands on the planet.\u201dHe\u2019s a stats guy, so he had the math to back it up: Over the last few decades, he said, she\u2019s sold several billion dollars in consumer goods, with nearly $2 billion grossed in fragrances alone; her best-selling \u201cGlow\u201d line jump-started the contemporary market for celebrity scents. \u201cShe has over 150 million followers on social media, and over 75 percent of those are millennials,\u201d Rodriguez continued. \u201cShe\u2019s able to see around corners and connect with the masses at a level that I\u2019ve never seen anyone connect with. She innately has that DNA that understands how to land her points. That\u2019s just maybe being a great communicator.\u201dThe movie, which co-stars Lopez\u2019s real-life BFF Leah Remini as her onscreen BFF, and Milo Ventimiglia as her (ahem) itching-to-get-hitched baseball manager boyfriend, puts Lopez back in the sights of the kind of broad fare that cemented her stardom: romantic comedies about hypercompetent strivers from the wrong side of the tracks who move (or rather, marry) up. It was developed and co-written by Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, Lopez\u2019s producing partner, who conceived it before the two even began working together. She was also a producer of \u201cMaid in Manhattan,\u201d Lopez\u2019s 2002 blockbuster.And she realized that she didn\u2019t prioritize her own needs enough, compared with those of the men in her life; growing up, she\u2019d internalized some Cinderella fantasies. When Emme suggested not long ago that she might not get married, Lopez took it as a parental victory: \u201cI\u2019ve always been trying to tell her, love yourself. You don\u2019t need anybody to complete you.\u201d She added: \u201cShe don\u2019t need no fairy tale.\u201dThat could be a message of \u201cSecond Act,\u201d too. But it also glosses over the institutional and social hurdles that a character like Maya might face. To Lopez, that is another instance where mind-over-matter determination should prevail. She was a Puerto Rican from the middle-class Bronx with aspirations far beyond that, and a tenacity that made it happen. \u201cThere is racism. There is sexism. There is ageism. There is all of this and you know what, that\u2019s still not going to stop me,\u201d she said. \u201cI believe that 100 percent, to the bottom of my soul.\u201dThe hustle instilled in her, as one of three daughters of a computer technician and a kindergarten teacher, has served her well professionally. Nuyorican, the production company she founded nearly two decades ago, has lately been on an upswing, with TV series (\u201cShades of Blue,\u201d the NBC cop drama that she starred in for three seasons, until it ended in August; \u201cGood Trouble,\u201d a spinoff of her Freeform family show \u201cThe Fosters;\u201d and the popular reality series \u201cWorld of Dance,\u201d on which Lopez is a judge) and many movie projects in the works.Though Lopez is interested in giving more representation to Latinx characters and artists, she said, she also believes not every story needs that. With romantic comedies and the like, \u201cyou just want it to be a person \u2014 everyman, everywoman.\u201d The new movie doesn\u2019t explore Maya\u2019s roots. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Lopez said, dropping in an expletive. \u201cLike, she\u2019s a person with feelings. That\u2019s it. She\u2019s a human being who struggles.\u201dMeanwhile, Lopez is so radiant, she looks like she\u2019s been Instagram-filtered. As I sat across from her, surrounded by tall orchids and bright roses, those aphoristic pillows started to seem really credible, especially with a phalanx of uniformed staff to clean and fluff them. She was willfully positive (happiness is \u201cthe choice I make every day\u201d) but also bristled, in a relatable way, at how women have been forever discounted. In the Time\u2019s Up era, \u201cI really feel like we\u2019re changing that,\u201d she said.\u201cShe has her fingerprints on everything,\u201d Goldsmith-Thomas said. With a movie idea, \u201cwe talk about directors and writers and how we\u2019re going to sell it.\u201d Her 2015 thriller \u201cThe Boy Next Door,\u201d one of only a few movies she\u2019s appeared in since 2012 and the first produced by Nuyorican, received poor reviews but earned more than $52 million on a budget of a reported $4 million.For Lopez, a turning point came in 2011, when she signed on as a judge for the then-top rated \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d She considered it a career rejuvenation, and a way to reintroduce herself to a public that had cooled on her supposed diva reputation, earned in the years of Bennifer and contract riders demanding all-white dressing rooms. With \u201cIdol,\u201d \u201cpeople were saying they liked me, which made me realize how many years I\u2019d spent thinking they didn\u2019t, and that affected how I felt about myself,\u201d Lopez wrote in her book. (Bennifer, her failed engagement to Ben Affleck, seems like a tabloid eon ago but exacted a heavy emotional toll; she wed Anthony in the aftermath.) Her five-season tenure on \u201cIdol\u201d \u201cwas the first time in a long time that I felt good about just being me,\u201d she wrote.Medina, who has known Lopez for more than 20 years, said that with this romance, \u201cthe personal confidence and comfort level has risen to a high that I\u2019ve never seen before. We\u2019re experiencing a new version of Jennifer Lopez.\u201dHis guidance on her work, she said, started with discussions of his investments, mostly owned, versus her licensing deals, which always \u201cfelt imbalanced to me,\u201d she said. \u201cHow did I help these people make a billion dollars and I came home with this very small fraction of that? Should I not have participated in that since it was my name, my idea, my product?\u201d Rodriguez, who took business classes at Columbia University and counts Warren Buffett as a mentor and friend, has counseled Lopez to go \u201cnarrow and deep\u201d with her projects \u2014 to do less, but own more.Her vision now is for artists to develop and finance their ideas independently, then find a profit-sharing distributor. \u201cI should be a partner,\u201d she said. As artists, \u201cwe\u2019re not disposable.\u201dBoth are mindful of the example they\u2019re setting for their children. She\u2019s teaching his daughters, age 10 and 13, \u201chow to sing, how to dance, how to stand as a strong woman, and it\u2019s incredibly powerful and beautiful for me to see,\u201d Rodriguez said.Lopez said she hoped to leave a mark on \u201cthe world I want my daughter to live in and my son, who\u2019s going to be a man who respects women and understands women and gives them their worth.\u201dAs a professional who carved out a path where there was none, \u201cI\u2019m only with people who understand that we\u2019re in the history-making business,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re in the trailblazing business, we\u2019re in the break-down-the-walls, kick-the-glass-ceiling business. That\u2019s the business that we\u2019re in. If you\u2019re not on board for that, then we can\u2019t work together.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Passengers Are Stranded as Another European Airline Collapses", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrimera Air, a small low-cost airline that spent the last year expanding its reach from northern Europe to hubs in North America, filed for bankruptcy and ceased flying on Monday night, leaving passengers stranded at airports on both sides of the Atlantic.The airline had been jostling for a toehold in the crowded European market, where consolidation and the fierce battle for customers have led to the collapse of several airlines in recent years, including Air Berlin, Alitalia and Monarch in Britain.But Primera\u2019s finances started to erode as it continued to offer new routes while contending with higher fuel costs, delayed airplane deliveries and issues like corrosion on its aircraft.On Monday night, after 14 years of operations, the company said it had failed to get an agreement for a short-term loan from its bank.The abrupt end left many hundreds of passengers stranded at airports. At Dulles International Airport outside Washington, Pavithra Selvakumar, a 24-year-old student, was stuck trying to get back to Britain after her Primera flight was canceled.There was no staff at the airline\u2019s desk, she said Tuesday, and she was among 30 to 40 people trying to sort out their journeys. Some of them canceled their vacations.\u201cI could see a girl crying here, there were old people, people with kids,\u201d Ms. Selvakumar said. She was waiting to see if her family and friends might be able to transfer her some money for another flight.At Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, flights for about 370 Primera passengers were canceled, officials said. One of them, Eric Jetner, a 33-year-old singer and actor who had a ticket for a Monday night flight to Newark, said what was going on was unclear to even the staff at the desks.\u201cThe front desk attendants said they were trying to call the president of the company and nobody was answering the call,\u201d Mr. Jetner said. Later, a letter was handed out explaining that the company had ceased operations, but there were not enough copies for everyone.\u201cWe had to take a picture of it,\u201d he added.At London\u2019s Stansted Airport, 400 travelers were affected.Despite low prices and new trans-Atlantic routes, the company could not grow fast enough to outpace rising oil prices, said Andrew Charlton, managing director of Aviation Advocacy, a consultancy. All low-cost airlines \u201chave to live on the edge of their cash flow to get big enough to get the scale to be successful,\u201d Mr. Charlton said.As the summer holiday period came to a close and bills started to pile up, the company decided to fold.And other low-cost airlines could follow as they also struggle with the narrow margins, Mr. Charlton said. \u201cEven if you take two or three routes from them, that will tip the balance,\u201d he explained.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a stranded passenger at Dulles International Airport. She is Pavithra Selvakumar, not Selvakunar.Advertisement"}

If you have ever worked in a customer service position, you are probably familiar with managerial lectures about not veering off script.

Students were lost in the bureaucratic shuffle of loan applications, tax-verification documents and arcane equations that calculate their expected ability to pay down to the last penny. I spent my days reciting instructions for requesting tax return transcripts from the I.R.S., applying for loans and reading nauseating overdue charges off student accounts.And those were just the easy calls. I also spoke to a mother who cried as I explained that if she couldn\u2019t pay more than $8,000 by the next business day, her child would not be allowed to return to college in the fall. But it felt to me that our only real job was to decrease callers\u2019 average wait time.

Big U.S. Deals Could Suffer.", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow China is looking for new ways to retaliate in the intensifying trade drama \u2014 and experts warn that some corporate deals with American buyers could be in jeopardy.China\u2019s antitrust regulators disclose little about their deliberations. But some companies worry that this opacity could provide cover for retaliation in response to tariffs that the United States has placed on Chinese goods \u2014 and wonder if long-negotiated deals could become collateral damage in the trade war.\u201cGiven the level of trade tensions now, in some exceptional cases you cannot exclude the possibility that individual transactions may be implicated,\u201d said Fay Zhou, a partner at the law firm Linklaters in Beijing.Officials at China\u2019s antimonopoly agency, the State Administration for Market Regulation, did not respond to requests for comment.American companies have prospered by exploring new markets and taking risks to extend their global reach. But President Trump warned last week that these were early days in his trade strategy \u2014 \u201cChina wants to talk, very badly, and I said, \u2018Frankly, it\u2019s too early to talk\u2019 \u201d \u2014 and American companies may encounter some backlash from Beijing.So China has only so many avenues to inflict pain. They could include slow inspections for imports at Chinese ports and tighter regulatory scrutiny of American companies doing business in China.Deals are a ripe area, too.\u201cThis is a way for China to put pressure on American corporations to get them to work on the U.S. government,\u201d said Chen Zhiwu, a professor of finance and the director of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong.Blocking American deals comes with some cost. Aggressive regulators could spur foreign companies to retreat from China just when economic growth there is slowing.\u201cChina has valid reasons to be angry with the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist tariffs,\u201d said Fred Hu, the chairman of Primavera Capital Group and a former chairman of Goldman Sachs for China. But, he added, \u201cit is unlikely to direct its anger at American businesses.\u201d\u201cOn the contrary, China is trying to cultivate ties with them,\u201d Mr. Hu said.Regulators in China have a wide scope for denying deals by American buyers, even if Chinese companies aren\u2019t involved. Chinese officials can block a deal for any new venture that they deem would have too much market control in China. The country\u2019s broadly defined antimonopoly law allows regulators to consider more than what an individual deal might cost consumers or a specific Chinese business.\u201cAuthorities are obliged to consider not just the competition merits of a deal but also the impact of a deal on China\u2019s national economy,\u201d said Ms. Zhou, a former official at the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, which until recently was in charge of greenlighting deals.United Technologies said it was still on track with regulatory approvals needed for its Rockwell Collins deal. But when asked on a conference call in June whether the trade war could prevent the deal from going through, Akhil Johri, United Technology\u2019s chief financial officer said, \u201cThat is something you always have to think about or worry about.\u201dLast Monday, United Technologies received a green light from regulators in the United States. \u201cThe process for closing on Rockwell Collins is moving forward with the recent U.S. Department of Justice approval being the latest milestone,\u201d said Michele Quintaglie, a spokeswoman for United Technologies. China\u2019s approval is the last step.The Disney-Fox and United Technologies-Rockwell Collins deals may be less likely to attract scrutiny because they aren\u2019t as central to Chinese business as Qualcomm. The chip maker supplied essential parts for the country\u2019s big smartphone manufacturers.It is unclear whether the Chinese authorities will scrutinize the Disney-Fox deal in particular, but experts said a deep review would be consistent with traditionally tight regulatory controls over foreign content and information.\u201cThe party has been more interested in containing American influence in the cultural space and entertainment space,\u201d Mr. Chen, of the Asia Global Institute, said. \u201cBlocking such a deal would serve to keep the American influence away and also make a point to America.\u201dCao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Explosive Devices Add to Climate of Overheated Partisan Rancor", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 One suspicious package went to George Soros, the billionaire investor and liberal philanthropist who is a perpetual target of conservative conspiracy theories and smears \u2014 everything from being a former Nazi to the secret financier of the caravan of migrants making its way toward the United States.Another went to John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director often maligned by conservatives as a leading conspirator in a \u201cdeep state\u201d plot to undermine President Trump. Hillary Clinton was also sent one, as were President Barack Obama and his attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. \u2014 all of them subjects of fantastical, far-flung rumors and misinformation campaigns.Law enforcement officials have not identified any suspects or motives in the rash of explosive devices that arrived this week at the addresses of some of the most vilified public figures in Democratic politics. For a country already on edge \u2014 consumed with overheated partisan rancor and divided over matters as basic as what separates fact and fiction \u2014 the attempted attacks marked an unsettling turn less than two weeks before a crucial midterm election.But for a moment, at least, the political world paused on Wednesday to urge greater calm in a climate that had become dangerously inflammatory. Speaking at the White House, the president condemned the acts, saying that \u201cacts or threats of political violence of any kind have no place in the United States of America.\u201dMrs. Clinton, speaking at a Democratic fund-raiser in Florida, called the moment \u201ctroubling\u201d and \u201ca time of deep divisions.\u201d\u201cWe have to do everything we can to bring our country together,\u201d she added.Representative Steve Scalise, a Republican who was shot and almost killed in a mass shooting at a congressional baseball practice last year, called the acts \u201cevil\u201d and said, \u201cAs a nation, we must agree that this is a dangerous path and it cannot become the new normal.\u201dThose attempts at reconciliation and reflection, however, quickly gave way to the kind of reflexive, tribal defensiveness that is far more common today.Many prominent conservative commentators \u2014 among them some of the president\u2019s most ardent defenders \u2014 quickly pointed the finger at the left, accusing unnamed liberal agitators of sending the packages in a ploy to make Republicans look radical right before the midterms.\u201cMrs. Clinton, it\u2019s your party, forgive me, that is encouraging this kind of thing,\u201d Mr. Limbaugh said on his show on Wednesday. \u201cIt is the Democrat Party that\u2019s home to all of these mobs,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s a smell test that this stuff has to pass. And, so far, a lot of people\u2019s noses are in the air, not quite certain of what to make of this.\u201dAlex Jones, the conspiracy peddler who runs the website Infowars, said the bombs were likely plants by the left and its allies in the media like CNN, where the package to Mr. Brennan was sent.\u201cThis is introducing them as the targets so they can whine, and moan, and predict, \u2018If Trump doesn\u2019t stop, you\u2019re going to get us all killed,\u2019\u201d Mr. Jones said on his daily online program.Regardless of the culprit\u2019s identity or political sympathies, there is no dispute that the people on the receiving end of the packages have all been targets of the kind of insults, threats and wild theories that often originate on right-wing websites and message boards, and then spread after others on the right, and sometimes the president himself, elevate them to legitimacy.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.\u201cCan you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?\u201d the president wrote.Experts in political violence said the attempted bombings seemed distressingly in line with the dehumanizing us vs. them tenor that has marked the current political discourse.\u201cPeople feel encouraged to attack people who are voting for the other party,\u201d said Carolyn Lukensmeyer, the executive director of the National Institute for Civil Discourse. \u201cAnd this has now become \u2018If you\u2019re not with me, you\u2019re against me. And not only are you against me, but you are dangerous.\u2019\u201d\u201cThis is a virus on our society,\u201d she added.The story of the migrant caravan has triggered an outpouring of outrage in conservative news media. With its compelling images \u2014 video of thousands of Latin Americans making a march north toward the United States, broadcast almost hourly by Fox News \u2014 the caravan has become the visual manifestation of the fears and anxieties over illegal immigration that Mr. Trump and other conservatives, as well as many Republican candidates in the midterms, have warned about repeatedly.The caravan has also become the vehicle for some of the more outrageous conspiracy theories about immigrants, including a claim by the president that Middle Easterners were among the marchers. Mr. Trump later acknowledged that he had no proof.Mr. Trump and his allies have tried to link the caravan with what they have depicted as a menacing threat from the \u201cmob\u201d of Democratic protesters who have rallied against his administration. In the eyes of many conservatives, these portrayals are helpful politically as a way of casting Democrats as undermining law and order \u2014 both on the southern border and in the public square.Mr. Limbaugh suggested that the attempted bombings on Wednesday were a way of diverting attention from the caravan.\u201cAnd by the way, guess what\u2019s also not in the news now?\u201d Mr. Limbaugh asked his audience. \u201cThat\u2019s the other mob that\u2019s finding its way north through Mexico attempting to crash the U.S. border at or near Election Day.\u201dAngelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America, a liberal group that critiques conservative news media, said he saw the bombs as evidence of how the president\u2019s verbal threats can be amplified and potentially lead to physical harm.\u201cThere had been this pretty generic brewing narrative of left-wing violence, and those are the entities that got targeted,\u201d he said, noting that packages were sent to those who had recently made comments that conservatives said were inciting violence: Representative Maxine Waters, who called for demonstrators to confront Republicans; Mrs. Clinton, who said in a recent interview that civility with the right was not achievable; and Mr. Holder, who said in comments he later clarified that Democrats should \u201ckick\u201d Republicans when they go low.Mr. Trump singled them all out by name in a video he filmed at the White House last week. \u201cThey\u2019re losing it,\u201d he said.The caravan, Mr. Carusone added, quickly became a piece of the story of the Democratic \u201cmob\u201d when Mr. Trump and others on the right linked it to Mr. Soros and the Democrats.\u201cYou can\u2019t divorce Trump from the right-wing media at this moment,\u201d Mr. Carusone added.In his remarks at the White House, Mr. Trump said an investigation into the bombings was underway, and that \u201cthe full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible to justice.\u201dPreventing political violence, he said, was a \u201cvery bipartisan statement.\u201dIsabella Grull\u00f3n Paz contributed reportingAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s New Iran Sanctions May Hit Snag With Global Financial Service", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Trump administration abandoned the nuclear deal with Iran this year and is reimposing sanctions against the country. The sanctions leave Western companies and banks with a stark choice. If they do business with Iran, they lose access to the American market and financial system. Not surprisingly, businesses and banks have been cutting ties with Iran or shelving plans to invest there. But one important financial link to the country remains: the financial messaging service that plays a crucial role in moving money around the international banking system.The messaging service is run by a Belgian cooperative called Swift. The service, which is owned and used by banks around the world, plays a central role in the flow of money across the globe. If, say, a Bank of America customer wants to send money to a client of Barclays, Bank of America will send a message over Swift\u2019s network to Barclays, notifying it of its intention to move the money. Swift does not hold any of the money itself.Because the next wave of United States sanctions target financial messaging, Swift now finds itself under pressure from Washington to disconnect from Iran. But it has not done so yet \u2014 and time is running out. Those sanctions take effect after Nov. 4.The Trump administration now has to weigh some tough choices. It could take a hard-edge approach and impose penalties on Swift or the banks and people connected to the entity. But that could unsettle the major financial institutions that own and rely on Swift. The importance of the messaging service is hard to overstate. Swift connects more than 11,000 banks across more than 200 countries, and there is no other entity that could quickly step in and take its place.But if Swift is allowed to maintain its current connections with Iran, the country\u2019s leaders could exploit Swift to move money in and out of the country. It would also help the European Union\u2019s efforts to keep the Iran nuclear accord afloat.Here are some of the questions that loom over the Swift battle.President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John R. Bolton, has taken a hawkish approach to Iranian sanctions. Last month, he said that executives at entities like Swift needed to ask whether doing business in Iran was \u201cworth the risk.\u201dBut the Treasury Department actually oversees the imposition of sanctions, and it has significant leeway in putting them into effect. When asked how it might approach Swift, the Treasury declined to comment specifically on any potential sanctions against the messaging service. In an emailed statement, the agency added, \u201cRegardless of the mechanisms a person or entity tries to use to transact business with a sanctioned Iranian entity, Treasury intends to take action against those conducting prohibited transactions.\u201dTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was expected to discuss Iranian sanctions and Swift with European officials at the meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Bali, Indonesia, which ends on Sunday.Since large European energy companies have severed ties with Iran, saying they did not want to jeopardize their business in the United States, Swift could do the same. Or it could decide doing business in the country was too risky, perhaps citing concerns that Iran\u2019s banks don\u2019t comply sufficiently with international regulations and norms. Recall that Swift cut ties with Iran in 2012, when sanctions were imposed the country.But to Swift\u2019s leaders, the current situation may not be so straightforward. In 2012, both the United States and the European Union imposed penalties on Iran, and Swift, as a Belgian entity, had to comply with the bloc\u2019s measures.In a statement, Swift said it was consulting with authorities from both the United States and the European Union.If the Trump administration takes action against Swift, it must do so with care. Placing sanctions on Swift would most likely cause banks to stop using the service, which might be enough to prompt Swift to disconnect from Iran.Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which supports sanctions against Iran, suggested an alternative to sanctions for Swift. The United States could put members of Swift\u2019s board on its sanctions list. Such sanctions, Mr. Goldberg said, would allow the Trump administration to apply pressure on Swift while avoiding much of the uncertainty caused by targeting Swift itself.Some experts on sanctions said it\u2019s important not to focus too much on Swift.By targeting Iranian banks, the United States has already gone a long way toward isolating Iran. Any advantage gained from forcing Swift to back out of Iran might be limited and not worth the potential financial disruption and damage to relations with the European Union, says Katherine Bauer, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cIt\u2019s not a silver bullet,\u201d she said.But Mr. Goldberg says disconnecting Swift would help fulfill President Trump\u2019s goals on Iran. \u201cYou can have sanctions at a seven or you can have sanctions at a 10,\u201d he said, \u201cThe president wanted a maximum pressure campaign.\u201dAn earlier version of this article reported incorrectly the name of an organization where Richard Goldberg is a senior adviser. It is the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, not the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a particularly challenging question this year, since special elections have shown Democrats voting in large numbers.To estimate the likely electorate, we combine what people say about how likely they are to vote with information about how often they have voted in the past. In previous races, this approach has been more accurate than simply taking people at their word.

{"Headline": "5 Takeaways From the Latest Campaign Finance Reports", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNational Democratic Party committees and super PACs outraised their Republican counterparts this month, but the Republican committees had more money in the bank as of last week.Some Democratic candidates benefited from a surge in small donations after opposing the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, while the party\u2019s major donors helped their side\u2019s so-called super PACs outpace their Republican counterparts in raising money. Yet the reports show that leading national committees supporting Republicans ended up with more money in the bank last week.The reports, which were filed with the Federal Election Commission, covered the period from the beginning of the month through last Wednesday, offering the last comprehensive portrait of the campaign finance landscape before the election.Down the homestretch, the remaining cash will most likely be spent on voter-mobilization efforts and last-minute advertising barrages that will blanket the airwaves and social media feeds of voters in targeted states and districts.The Democrats\u2019 three party committees and their two main congressional super PACs outraised their Republican counterparts in the first 17 days of the month \u2014 $110 million to $79 million, including loans \u2014 but the Republican committees finished with more money in the bank.Thanks in part to lower spending rates, the Republican committees had a total of nearly $140 million on hand at the end of the day last Wednesday, versus nearly $108 million for the Democratic committees.In a significant boost for Democrats hoping to claw back control of one or both chambers of Congress, their side's super PACs out-raised their Republican counterparts on the strength of massive checks from wealthy partisans.The Republican committees included in this tally are the Republican National Committee, the party\u2019s two congressional campaign arms \u2014 the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee \u2014 as well as the super PAC focused on the party\u2019s House candidates, the Congressional Leadership Fund, and the one helping its Senate candidates, the Senate Leadership Fund.The Democratic committees included in this analysis are the Democratic National Committee, the party\u2019s two congressional campaign arms \u2014 the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u2014 as well as the super PAC focused on the party\u2019s House candidates, House Majority PAC, and the one helping its Senate candidates, Senate Majority PAC.Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign was not required to file a finance report on Thursday, because he is not up for election next month. But his fund-raising appeal trickled down to other committees that are directly involved in the midterms.By contrast, the Democratic National Committee, which has lagged significantly behind the R.N.C. in fund-raising, has transferred only $2.4 million to the party\u2019s House campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, most of which came this month.The fund-raising surge left her with more than $11 million in the bank for the final three weeks until Election Day \u2014 a sum that could be difficult to spend effectively, given North Dakota\u2019s relatively inexpensive media market. The four leading super PACs supporting each side\u2019s respective congressional candidates raised $85 million in the first two and a half weeks of the month, powered by seven- and eight-figure donations from some of the biggest donors in American politics.That still ranks him behind the cycle\u2019s most prolific donors, the Las Vegas casino tycoons Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, who are motivated largely by their hawkish views on Israel\u2019s defense. They have donated more than $112 million to super PACs supporting Republican candidates.On the Republican side, the Senate Leadership Fund has received nearly $13 million from an affiliated nonprofit group called One Nation that does not disclose its donors, according to Thursday\u2019s filings.And the Congressional Leadership Fund had accepted more than $23 million from a linked nonprofit group called American Action Network that also does not disclose its donors.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Merkel Eyes Exit, Nervous E.U. Wonders Who\u2019ll Take the Stage", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European stage Angela Merkel commanded for so long and so effectively may be cracking, if not collapsing. She has been the poster woman for Europe\u2019s democratic center, but the center is imploding. She and Germany have been a symbol of stability, but now even Germany is seen as politically unstable.Ms. Merkel may be becoming more unpopular at home, and her influence over others may be waning. But to those who believed \u2014 and worked for \u2014 the dream of an ever-closer union, Ms. Merkel was considered fundamentally reliable, decent and committed to Europe and its values. She stood as a bulwark against the strutting populists who now run countries as varied as Italy, Hungary and Poland.What Europe will do without Ms. Merkel is no small question, especially when nationalism is rising and Europe\u2019s politics seem to be reorganized not along the usual left-right spectrum, but rather around who is for Europe, and who is against it.\u201cShe provided the sense that someone was in control and could be counted on,\u201d said Jan Techau, the Berlin-based director of the Europe program for the German Marshall Fund. \u201cShe gave the assurance that Germany was the reserve power in Europe on which you could depend. While she made mistakes, you could rely on Merkel even if you didn\u2019t like her.\u201dWho can act as a counterbalance to the forces tearing at the bloc\u2019s unity in her eventual absence \u2014 Ms. Merkel has said she would finish her term that ends in 2021, though that seems doubtful \u2014 is suddenly an urgent discussion.Tomas Valasek, the director of Carnegie Europe, said that Ms. Merkel \u201ccreated European consensus out of nothing,\u201d and everyone wonders, \u201cMy God, who will do the job for her?\u201dThe problem for Mr. Macron was, and remains, that he is not strong enough on his own to push through his ambitious vision of \u2018\u2018more Europe.\u2019\u2019 He needs German support.On paper Ms. Merkel has committed to support some of Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas for eurozone reform and his call for a new start in Europe. If she was lukewarm to some of his other proposals \u2014 like the idea of empowering a European finance minister \u2014 Ms. Merkel did at least provide a reasonably like-minded partner at the core of Europe.Any Merkel successor is unlikely to be any more supportive of Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas, and will have a lot less stature in Brussels than the chancellor has earned after what have been some 102 European summit meetings since she took power in 2005.In any case, the rest of this year will see little progress, notes Josef Janning of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, because \u201cshe\u2019s a very lame duck until a new party leader is elected, without carte blanche to move in Europe.\u201dAll of that portends badly for buttressing European Union machinery that could help the bloc head off another financial crisis, or at least weather one. \u201c2018 was supposed to be the year of reform,\u201d Mr. Janning said. \u201cBut nothing much has happened except trying to solve one crisis after another.\u201dMs. Merkel\u2019s failure to do more in all these years to secure the institutional future of the euro will be a lasting mark against her, Mr. Techau believes.While a reluctant leader, Ms. Merkel has provided a dignified but firm response to both President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and to President Trump, who have both tried to provoke her.Some European leaders, of course, will be glad to see her go. Ms. Merkel\u2019s critics note that her hard line on enforcing austerity during the financial crisis and her decision to let a million migrants into Germany may have helped fuel the populist backlash that is now Europe\u2019s biggest challenge.The Polish politician Jaroslaw Kaczynski has demonized the German chancellor over the migration issue and her support for the Nordstream II pipeline from Russia, and the Greeks blamed her for all but strangling their country financially.Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, has set himself up as the anti-Merkel for European elections in May, and along with the new Italian populist leaders, has been critical of the sanctions on Russia but has so far not blocked their renewal.All the countries of Central Europe were opposed to Ms. Merkel\u2019s initial welcome of refugees and migrants and her efforts to spread them around. But as Mr. Valasek, the Carnegie Europe director, points out, the Czechs and Slovaks appreciate her financial rigor, and German investment in Central Europe has been crucial to the region\u2019s economy.Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin may be glad when she goes, as well.Mr. Trump has always had issues with Germany, especially over trade and the German devotion to multilateralism. \u201cBut with Merkel it seems to be worse, almost personal, the way she avoids open confrontation and sticks to her principles,\u201d Mr. Valasek said.\u2018Mr. Trump,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be relieved, but the fundamentals of the relationship won\u2019t change. And I think Putin will be delighted. The staying power of the sanctions against Russia were her personal triumph.\u201dThere will be continuing uncertainty as to how long Ms. Merkel will be able to continue as chancellor, despite her strong wish, as Mr. Janning said, \u201cto hand over the job to someone who has won it in an election.\u201d Ms. Merkel, who ran only reluctantly for a fourth term after the election of Mr. Trump, \u201cwill hand it over in dignity to an elected successor and not be pushed out by her party,\u201d he said.But new elections could come faster than she now expects.\u201cWith her departure,\u201d he wrote, \u201ca politician is leaving who had the ability to speak at eye level with Presidents Xi, Trump and Putin, and always represented the position of the E.U. It will take time before her successor reaches such standing.\u201dThere are worries about Ms. Merkel\u2019s position, somewhat thrust upon her, as the defender of Western values and the international order, especially in the face of the challenges from Mr. Trump, Mr. Putin and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. Those were expressed in a Twitter message by Richard N.

It may not be able to have it both ways.It\u2019s not Facebook\u2019s size that caused the issues. Size makes a platform attractive to hackers, but it also gives that platform more resources to defend itself. If there were, say, five smaller social networks in place of Facebook, that would probably make the situation far worse, because each would be more vulnerable to attack, and when serious problems arose, it would be harder to track down the bad behavior and figure out how to thwart it.Instead, he argues that there\u2019s a bigger problem: \u201cWe haven\u2019t agreed on a set of goals for how social media should impact civil society.\u201d Before we rush to tear up Facebook, he writes, we should work out if social media can be changed to improve society \u2014 as happened to newspapers, radio and TV \u2014 by demanding more from the companies.Mr. Hoffman concedes, though, that his approach would mean \u201ca long and never-ending process.\u201dMr. Nordhaus was cited for his work on the implications of environmental factors, including climate change. Mr. Romer was cited for his work on the importance of technological change.It\u2019s all about market failure. Left alone, markets will generate too much pollution (Nordhaus) and too few ideas (Romer).Avoiding global warming is expensive. Dealing with the damage that it causes could be financially ruinous.To avoid that fate, the report urges huge transformations of the world economy in the next few years. That means taxing carbon dioxide emissions (perhaps as high as $27,000 per ton by 2100), investments in clean energy (of $2.4 trillion every year through 2035), and a complete end of coal use by 2050.But such swift and unified change is politically unlikely, especially with President Trump intending to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.Traditional Republican donors like Paul Singer are still giving money to the party, but others have broken rank. Seth Klarman, the hedge fund billionaire, plans to give $20 million to Democrats. Other financiers are backing obscure Democratic candidates for Congress.Some of Wall Street\u2019s Democratic supporters say they\u2019re driven by opposition to President Trump. Others see something else at work: \u201cThey just want to follow winners,\u201d the conservative economist Stephen Moore told the NYT.Take Jack Poulson, a research scientist alarmed by Google\u2019s efforts to build a censored search engine for China. He took his concerns to Jeff Dean, the tech giant\u2019s head of A.I. What happened, according to Kate Conger and Cade Metz of the NYT:According to Dr. Poulson, Mr. Dean said that Google complied with surveillance requests from the federal government and asked rhetorically if the company should leave the United States market in protest. Mr. Dean also shared a draft of a company email that read, \u201cWe won\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t provide 100 percent transparency to every Googler, to respect our commitments to customer confidentiality and giving our product teams the freedom to innovate.\u201dThe next day, Dr. Poulson quit.It may be hard for these tech giants to find replacements, as well.

In the past couple of weeks alone, the president has spoken of riots that have not happened, claimed deals that have not been reached, cited jobs that have not been created and spun dark conspiracies that have no apparent basis in reality. He has pulled figures seemingly out of thin air, rewritten history and contradicted his own past comments.The catalog of inaccurate claims ranges from the weighty to the head-scratching. Mr. Trump\u2019s penchant for prevarication has been a well-documented hallmark of his presidency. He dismisses journalists who point out his falsehoods as nit-pickers who do not understand that he is speaking a larger truth that resonates with many Americans. Supporters at his rallies across the country tell reporters that they understand he may not be strictly accurate in his roaring stump speeches, but they see him as a champion of their values.Here are 15 of Mr. Trump\u2019s most egregious falsehoods since Oct. 22, fact-checked by category. what mr. trump said We\u2019re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States ... with all of those benefits. what mr. trump said There\u2019s a town in California where they actually tried to take over the town council. All illegal aliens running the town council.While there are a few examples of unauthorized immigrants participating in local government in California, there are no cities governed by them, nor do any hold elective office in the state. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any such place in California and am unaware of any place in California where you could even vote for city council as a noncitizen, not to speak of serving in elected office,\u201d said Taeku Lee, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cSeems like another made-up fact intended to stoke the fears of the president\u2019s base.\u201d Els de Graauw, a professor of political science at the City University of New York, agreed. \u201cI know that requirements can vary across offices and levels of government, but I cannot think of a municipality where noncitizens can run for public office,\u201d she said.what mr. trump said what mr. trump saidDo you know how the caravan started?

Here we are, less than two years, we\u2019ve put two of them on. Right?What Mr. Trump SaidAnd I was always critical of President Bush for attacking Iraq.What Mr. Trump SaidI went to Saudi Arabia on the basis that they would buy hundreds of billions \u2014 many billions of dollars\u2019 worth of things. And the ultimate number is around $450 billion, $110 for military. $450 billion. I think that\u2019s over a million jobs. A million to over a million jobs.Mr. Trump has celebrated an arms deal that was reached with Saudi Arabia last year, but his figures are wildly inflated.Last year, the Trump administration also trumpeted $270 billion in possible commercial deals, which double-counts some of the agreements in the arms package. It is unclear what Mr. Trump is referring to with the $450 billion figure.What Mr. Trump SaidBut I\u2019m one of the most popular presidents in this country, and that\u2019s good. That\u2019s just good.what mr. trump saidThe total amount of opioids being prescribed has decreased by nearly 20 percent in a very short period of time. I\u2019m very proud of that.what mr. trump saidRepublicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not!

{"Headline": "A Kitchen Visionary, Reimagining Dishes and a Woman\u2019s Role", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmy Brandwein of Centrolina, in Washington, has reinvented Italian classics and tried to get people thinking differently about women who run restaurants.\u201cI thought, lose the penne,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s make the eggplant its own dish: pasta alla Norma \u2014 minus the pasta.\u201dMs. Brandwein, 48, has had visions before. Contemplating the gleaming, tiled cafes with adjacent groceries that she had seen in Rome, she could envision her own sleek, hip place right in the center of Washington. At its heart would be an open kitchen serving rustic, seasonal Italian cuisine, and on the side, a market selling the same high-quality local produce, seafood and imported condiments she would cook with.That idea didn\u2019t seem radical to her, either, but when she went to banks for financing, they repeatedly rejected her proposal.\u201cTo them, I was doing something different \u2014 a woman opening a restaurant without any male partners,\u201d she recalled as she shook a pan full of sweet, sliced onions over the fierce blue flames of her stove at Centrolina. \u201cThey wanted to see a hundred other successful businesses in the same model, but there weren\u2019t a lot of comparable places to point to.\u201d\u201cComparable,\u201d in the banks\u2019 parlance, meant owned by a woman.The pan hissed and sputtered as Ms. Brandwein poured tomatoes into the steaming onions, setting the pot to simmer into a heady sauce. Then she took out her chef\u2019s knife and got to work on the eggplant, expertly slicing it into fat, even cubes, a bit larger than she would for a pasta topping. The girth of the pieces helps maintain their texture, she said, so they get crunchy on the outside without turning to mush within. She deep-fries the chunks in her ever-ready fryer at the restaurant; at home, a broiler gets the job done.It took her four grueling years to gather the funding for Centrolina, cobbled together from a mix of small investors, colleagues and customers whom she talked into the deal, one at a time.Financing secured, she put together her team, hiring women for all the management positions. She did this, in part, because she hoped that once the restaurant succeeded, it would stand as an example for other female chefs and entrepreneurs, as well as for the banks.When you read the menu, the reason is obvious: Ms. Brandwein has a way of seeing Italian classics from a fresh angle. She seems to ask herself, is there a way to make an already wonderful dish even more delicious?Sometimes the answer is no, and then she brings her exquisite technique to familiar dishes: grilled daily fish, or homemade ravioli with roasted squash, sage, butter and amaretto cookies.But when the answer is yes, the results can be thrilling. She serves her burrata with caviar and homemade potato chips, her gnocchi with nebbiolo-braised goat, her buckwheat chitarra pasta with anchovy and chickpeas.As for her higher ambitions? The restaurant business is finally changing, she said, and female chefs are getting at least a bit more of the respect and attention they\u2019ve earned.\u201cNow it\u2019s a great time to be a woman chef,\u201d she said. \u201cI just had to wait 20 years for that to happen.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump-Fed Conspiracy Theories About Migrant Caravan Intersect With Deadly Hatred", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisMURPHYSBORO, Ill. \u2014 Alicia Hooten thinks the country has plenty of problems. \u201cSo many; so many,\u201d she said warily, before settling on the one at the top of her mind with the midterm election just a week away. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re fighting for our freedom when it comes to our borders.\u201dShe spoke while waiting for President Trump\u2019s campaign rally on Saturday, hours after the deadly shootings in Pittsburgh. Ms. Hooten, a graphic designer from nearby Sparta, Ill., said she was especially concerned about the caravan of migrants in southern Mexico, calling it \u201ca ploy to destroy America, and to bring us to our knees.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not going to take it \u2014 not going to go down without a fight,\u201d she insisted.For the last two weeks, Mr. Trump and his conservative allies have operated largely in tandem on social media and elsewhere to push alarmist, conspiratorial warnings about the migrant caravan more than 2,000 miles from the border. They have largely succeeded in animating Republican voters like Ms. Hooten around the idea of these foreign nationals posing a dire threat to the country\u2019s security, stability and identity.The baseless claims that George Soros is financing the migrants as they trek north, which carry a strong whiff of anti-Semitism, have been one of the most consistent themes of commentary on the caravan from the right. And their persuasive power was evident over the weekend in interviews at the president\u2019s rally in Murphysboro, where several people described Mr. Soros, the liberal billionaire philanthropist, as the caravan\u2019s mastermind and made assertions like \u201cI\u2019m positive he\u2019s the one behind it,\u201d \u201cIt looks a tad staged,\u201d and \u201cAll these people are being paid off.\u201dRobert Bowers, who was arrested in the assault on the Pittsburgh synagogue, also pushed online conspiracy theories about the migrant caravan, in addition to anti-Semitic diatribes.Mr. Trump and Republican officials have shown no signs of backing off their approach to stoking fears about the caravan in the final days of the election season. Just a few hours after the synagogue killings on Saturday, Mr. Trump again referred to the midterms as \u201cthe election of the caravan,\u201d as he has done at other political rallies recently.These outcries, which have included unfounded claims about the caravan\u2019s origins and wildly fluctuating estimates of its size, are playing out in a clear pattern. They often start with right-wing commentators, conspiracy theorists and activist groups with large followings; their talk then breaks through more broadly on Fox News, Breitbart News and other outlets that are popular with conservative voters; and ultimately Mr. Trump tweets or remarks about them, acting as an amplifier and a validator.Apart from concerns of domestic terrorism, any number of threats, foreign and domestic, have been simmering in the weeks leading to the election, like the killing of a Washington Post columnist inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, though none of them have received as much attention from the president and his allies as the migrant caravan.Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and a confidante of Mr. Trump\u2019s, surmised in an interview with Fox News, \u201cIf you were a terrorist and wanted to get in the United States and you saw 10,000 people trying to get into the United States, how unlikely is it that you might decide to join them?\u201d(The size of the caravan has fluctuated over the course of the last two weeks, but it now numbers in the thousands.)Michael Savage, the conservative radio host, estimated the caravan\u2019s size at 14,000 on his program last week as he predicted that its eventual arrival would spell \u201cthe end of America as we know it.\u201dMr. Trump believes that focusing on illegal immigration is a winning strategy for him, and his advisers have come to share that view, armed with polling data that show that the issue continues to be a top priority for Republican base voters. They are using the caravan to raise broader fears as well about what they portray as a broken, permissive immigration system that is weakening the country culturally, financially and even physically.Republican officials are aware of the political downside of highlighting the issue, which tends to turn off suburban women and college-educated white voters, but they have calculated that using fear of crime and terrorism can neutralize that disadvantage. And they believe that Democrats have overplayed their hands on immigration because of calls by some of their prominent leaders for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency responsible for deportations.That is why Mr. Trump \u2014 and many Republican candidates who have followed his lead \u2014 have been touting their support for ICE and highlighting MS-13, the brutal transnational gang with roots in El Salvador, as well as the risks of so-called sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with the federal immigration authorities.Of the dozen people interviewed at Mr. Trump\u2019s rally, almost all of them spoke in considerable detail about their concerns over immigration. Ms. Hooten, the Trump supporter at the rally on Saturday, blamed Mr. Soros, Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama for the caravan.\u201cI think they\u2019re all involved in this,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel it\u2019s treason.\u201dAnother person at the rally, Jeff Hutson of Columbus, Ky., called the caravan \u201ca smoke screen\u201d \u2014 no different from a lot of other big news stories he said he thinks are intended to distract Americans. \u201cI think we\u2019ve had a lot of that going on,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of the shootings we\u2019ve had \u2014 anything big to draw attention away from something else that\u2019s going on.\u201dThe language and imagery of danger lurking within the caravan started almost immediately after its existence was reported this month. In some cases, as evident from the unproven claim that Middle Easterners were hiding among the migrants, that rhetoric traces a path from right-wing activists online to Mr. Trump.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Three days later, on Oct. 21, the group\u2019s president, Tom Fitton, appeared on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d to discuss its report and said that Guatemala had become \u201ca way station\u201d for terrorists.Not that such alarming language is out of the ordinary for the president. At a political rally in Kentucky this month, Mr. Trump declared that Democrats \u201cwant to open America\u2019s borders and turn our country into a friendly sanctuary for murderous thugs from other countries who will kill us all.\u201dJulie Hirschfeld Davis and Michael D.

{"Headline": "Sri Lanka Faces Constitutional Crisis as President Unseats Prime Minister", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Sri Lanka plunged into a constitutional crisis Friday after the president ousted the prime minister, a move that took the nation by surprise and was denounced as illegal by some government ministers.Sri Lankans were glued to their television sets Friday after President Maithripala Sirisena dismissed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and replaced him with Mahinda Rajapaksa, a popular former leader who was accused of human rights abuses, brazen nepotism and excessively close ties to China when he governed the country.The swearing-in ceremony, broadcast live, was a moment of high political drama for Sri Lanka, with Mr. Rajapaksa grinning as he shook Mr. Sirisena\u2019s hand. The men were former political allies until the president broke away from Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s party to unseat him in 2015.Fireworks and celebrations broke out across Sri Lanka after the swearing in ceremony, but the capital, Colombo, was uneasy as some cabinet ministers declared the move unconstitutional. Mr. Rajapaksa was sworn in at about 7 p.m. as representatives of the navy, air force and army watched in a stately room inside the presidential secretariat.Cabinet ministers and parliamentarians began defecting to the new government, but it remained unclear how many would ultimately cross over. The country\u2019s courts, seen as weak and politically influenced, were unlikely to rule against Mr. Sirisena.\u201cI am addressing you as the prime minister of Sri Lanka. I still hold the majority of the house,\u201d Mr. Wickremesinghe said in an address to the nation. \u201cConvene parliament and I will prove it.\u201dChaos gripped parts of the capital as supporters of Mr. Rajapaksa stormed the state-owned national television broadcaster and took it off the air. A clip later circulated showing a mob shouting at journalists inside the station. Troops were called in to protect the channel\u2019s staff.Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera tweeted that Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s appointment was \u201cunconstitutional and illegal. This is an anti-democratic coup.\u201dThe shake-up appeared to secure the re-ascendance of Mr. Rajapaksa, a man who served as Sri Lanka\u2019s president and prime minister for 10 years and ended the country\u2019s decades-long civil war.Mr. Rajapaksa is expected to win presidential elections next year, partly because Sri Lankans have grown discontent as the economy has sputtered under the current government.At the height of his power, Mr. Rajapaksa simultaneously served as president and finance minister, among other cabinet positions, while his three brothers served as the defense secretary and ministers of economy and ports. Between them they controlled 80 percent of the national budget and were accused of corruption and major human rights abuses. Their opponents and journalists critical of their governance often disappeared.Mr. Sirisena\u2019s power play is as much about the clashing personalities of the president and the prime minister as it is about geopolitics. The president and just-ousted prime minister had been political foes until they decided to unite their parties to run against Mr. Rajapaksa in 2015.India and China have been vying for influence in Sri Lanka, the island nation off India\u2019s southern coast. The country\u2019s ties with China strengthened under Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s rule, when he borrowed billions of dollars from Beijing\u2019s government to build infrastructure projects, some with little economic purpose.Western officials worry China could eventually use the strategically located port \u2014 which sits at the crossroads of one of the world\u2019s busiest maritime routes \u2014 for military purposes, which Beijing and Colombo have denied.Tension between President Sirisena and his ousted prime minister, Mr. Wickremesinghe, had been building up over the past year and spilled out into the open over the last few weeks. Mr. Sirisena began firing the heads of state institutions not in his purview and stacking them with loyalists.Last week, Mr. Wickremesinghe flew to India to meet with his counterpart, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, hoping to smooth relations. Mr. Wickremesinghe then released a summary of the meeting, claiming Mr. Modi had complained that Sri Lanka\u2019s government was stalling its infrastructure investments in the country and was not responding positively to India\u2019s diplomatic overtures.India\u2019s government was relieved when Mr. Rajapaksa lost elections in 2015, complaining that the former leader had strained ties with New Delhi while moving the country closer to Beijing.After the elections, India said it would invest in infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka and earlier this year committed to buy an airport in the country\u2019s south next to the Chinese-built seaport. But the airport deal has stalled.American officials were likely to be unhappy with the government shake up, believing Mr. Rajapaksa is too close to China to keep the country neutral.Vice President Mike Pence blasted what he called China\u2019s \u201cdebt trap diplomacy\u201d earlier this month and singled out Sri Lanka, saying the Chinese-built seaport \u201cmay soon become a forward military base for China\u2019s growing blue-water navy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s swearing-in; it was attended by representatives of the army, navy and air force, not by their chiefs. It also referred incorrectly to Sri Lanka\u2019s civil war; it ended in 2009, not 2015.Maria Abi-Habib reported from Islamabad and Dharisha Bastians from Colombo, Sri Lanka.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This is the front line of Saudi Arabia\u2019s invisible war", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "\nA piece of shrapnel had sliced his nose and lodged in his right eye. The fighter, a portly young man named Ibrahim Awad, groans. \u201cPlease, Hameed\u201d he calls to a fellow fighter, a glint of panic in his one good eye. \u201cMy head feels heavy.\u201dThe Saudi-led war in Yemen has ground on for more than three years, killing thousands of civilians and creating what the United Nations calls the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. But it took the crisis over the apparent murder of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi in a Saudi consulate two weeks ago for the world to take notice.Saudi Arabia\u2019s brash young crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, under scrutiny over the Khashoggi case, now faces a fresh reckoning for his ruthless prosecution of the war in Yemen \u2014 yet another foreign policy debacle for Saudi Arabia, and a catastrophe for the Arab world\u2019s poorest country.Outside Yemen, the catastrophic war has been largely overlooked.The Saudis barred foreign journalists from northern Yemen, scene of the biggest airstrike atrocities and the deepest hunger. The conflict is mostly unknown to Americans, whose military has backed the Saudi-led coalition\u2019s campaign with intelligence, bombs and refueling, leading to accusations of complicity in possible war crimes.SAUDIARABIAOMANRed SeaMidiERITREATarimGhaydahYEMENSanaHudaydahMukallaTaizMokhaGulf ofAdenAdenETHIOPIAArabianSeaSAUDIARABIARed SeaMidiTarimGhaydahSanaYEMENHudaydahMukallaTaizMokhaGulf ofAdenAdenETHIOPIAArabianSeaSAUDIARABIARed SeaMidiTarimSanaYEMENHudaydahMukallaTaizMokhaGulf ofAdenAdenETHIOPIASAUDIARABIARedSeaMidiSanaYEMENHudaydahMukallaTaizMokhaGulf ofAdenAdenETHIOPIASAUDIARABIARedSeaMidiSanaHudaydahYEMENTaizMokhaGulf ofAdenAdenETHIOPIASince June, the war has centered on the Red Sea port of Hudaydah. After a tense journey along a coastal highway prone to bombs and ambushes, we made a rare visit this month to the chaotic battlefield at the city gates.There we saw what Prince Mohammed\u2019s war looks like up close, from one side, among those Yemenis who are fighting and dying in it.Originally a movement of Shiite guerrillas from the mountainous northwest, the Houthis rose to power in the turmoil that followed the Arab Spring in 2011. After capturing the capital, Sana, in 2014, they soon controlled Yemen\u2019s three largest cities. Iran aided their advance with supplies of military equipment, including missiles.Since 2015, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have led a military coalition in a war aimed at ousting the Houthis and restoring an internationally recognized government. But early promises of a swift victory have given way to a bloody stalemate, while the war has inflicted a catastrophic toll on Yemenis, including widespread hunger and the worst cholera epidemic in history.In Hudaydah, the war has settled into a kind of desultory rhythm. The fighting crests at dawn and dusk, when fighters on both sides rain mortar shells across the front line.Within minutes, pickup trucks screech to a halt outside the field hospital, off-loading wounded fighters \u2014 men smeared in dirt and blood, peppered with shrapnel or felled by a sniper\u2019s bullet.Civilians soon follow: mothers hit by falling mortar shells, badly malnourished children suffering from acute diarrhea, elderly people with legs blown off by land mines.Yemeni medics established the field hospital at Durayhimy, on the southern edge of Hudaydah, in June, when they landed on the beach outside the villa as mortar shells landed around them, and waded ashore.Now financed by the Emirati Red Crescent, the hospital has an air of quirky, controlled chaos.It has no restrictions on guns or drugs: Young fighters slinging Kalashnikovs crowd the emergency room, standing anxiously over medics working to save their wounded comrades.Some nurses chew khat, the narcotic leaf beloved by Yemenis. At night, they gather in crowded dormitories to swap stories and gallows humor, and avoid enemy fire.Just before we arrived, they said, a Houthi drone had exploded over their rooms. Dr. Hazza Abdullah, 34, the doctor on duty, told of going for a swim in the sea during a lull in the fighting, only to be confronted with a spiky sea mine floating toward him. \u201cI got out very quickly,\u201d he said.Back in 2011, when the Arab Spring protests swept Yemen and other Arab countries, Dr. Abdullah embraced the promise of change.\u201cI thought it would be like the French Revolution, that it would open doors,\" he said. \"Instead we are going through hell.\u201dThere, we saw pickups loaded with fighters racing through the desert, wheels spinning and engines revving, dodging sniper fire and enemy mortars. Closer to the front line, fighters in sarongs hunkered behind sandy berms or clustered under trees. Warplanes whizzed overhead.A pair of cows, caught in the crossfire, lay rotting in the dust.We joined a group of jihadist fighters for lunch at their flophouse near the front line. Mortar tubes, surrounded by the refuse of emptied packaging tubes, were positioned outside the gate. Inside, fighters scooped up handfuls of rice and chicken, led by a cheery commander with a large bandage on his forehead where he had been grazed by a sniper\u2019s bullet.Boxes of Russian anti-tank missiles, stacked in a corner, bore markings that identified their Emirati purchasers.A fighter whipped out his phone.\u201cLook at this,\u201d he said gleefully, playing a video of a missile curling toward five Houthi fighters gathered under a tree. The video ended when they vanished into a ball of fire.Later, as darkness fell, the fighters returned to their positions.In seeking to capture Hudaydah\u2019s port, the coalition hopes to deprive the Houthis of millions of dollars in monthly tax revenues and force them to the negotiating table. But Hudaydah is also the gateway to a starving nation: Three-quarters of Yemen\u2019s 28 million people rely on some form of relief aid, and the vast majority of it passes through the port.Under intense international pressure, the coalition promised Western officials they would not fight in the city or the port, and would instead seek to encircle it. Now both sides are dug into positions on the city\u2019s fringes, exchanging fire but gaining little territory.A secondary front extends for about 80 miles to the south, parallel to the coalition-controlled coastal highway, where the fight takes place in remote villages and small towns, as both sides try to cut off each other\u2019s supply lines.SanaYEMENPORTHudaydahFRONT LINEDhamarFIELD HOSPITALRed SeaHouthicontrolledroadCoalitioncontrolledroadHaysKhokhaHOUTHICONTROLAREAERITREATaizCOALITIONCONTROLAREAMokhaAdenETHIOPIAGulf ofAdenSanaYEMENPORTHudaydahFRONT LINEDhamarFIELD HOSPITALRed SeaHouthicontrolledroadCoalitioncontrolledroadHaysKhokhaHOUTHICONTROLAREATaizCOALITIONCONTROLAREAERITREAMokhaSanaRedSeaFRONT LINEHudaydahYEMENHouthicontrolledroadCoalitioncontrolledroadHOUTHICONTROLAREAHaysKhokhaTaizMokhaCOALITIONCONTROLAREAERITREAGulf ofAdenSanaFRONT LINEHudaydahYEMENHouthicontrolledroadCoalitioncontrolledroadHOUTHICONTROLAREAHaysRedSeaKhokhaTaizMokhaCOALITIONCONTROLAREAERITREASanaYEMENFRONT LINEHudaydahHouthicontrolledroadCoalitioncontrolledroadHOUTHICONTROLAREAHaysKhokhaTaizMokhaCOALITIONCONTROLAREAGulf ofAdenThe United Nations says this secondary front is the deadliest area for civilians. At least 500,000 people have fled their homes, many forced to shelter in squalid refugee camps in towns further down the coast like Mokha, a small port once famous for its coffee exports, and nearby Khokha.Once a sleepy fishing town, Khokha buzzes with a lawless air, a melting pot of the war. Fighters mill about in the town center, chewing khat. The main drag is often jammed with military convoys headed for the front. Refugees, soldiers and Houthi spies mingle in the town bazaar.Gunfire erupts at night, though usually it\u2019s celebratory from weddings. The United Nations and most Western relief agencies have deemed the area too unsafe to serve. A notable exception is Doctors Without Borders, which recently opened a hospital in Mokha.For most refugees, the main worry is their next meal. At the city dump in Mokha, Thabet Bagash rummaged for glass bottles and tin cans.Before fighters ejected him from his home, he was a farmer. Now, he said, he was reduced to this. His face wrinkled with disdain. If he collected a bagful of cans, he might earn $1.40 \u2014 enough to feed his five children for a few days.But the expensive and much needed medical equipment is pristine and untouched. The authorities couldn\u2019t find medical staff to work there \u2014 Yemeni or Emirati.That seemed emblematic of the Emirati way of war. The United Arab Emirates pays wages for fighters,  and equips them with rockets and million-dollar armored vehicles.But Emirati generals direct the fight from the relative safety of Aden, the main city in southern Yemen, where the bulk of the estimated 5,000 Emirati soldiers in Yemen are based. Emirati warplanes and naval boats pummel targets in Hudaydah from the air and sea.Saudi naval boats also patrol the waters off Hudaydah.But on the front line, Emirati and Saudi soldiers are hard to find. Coalition bases along the coastal highway are guarded by Sudanese recruits, many from Darfur.At the field hospital, the dead and wounded we saw were Yemeni.It was probably too late for Mohammed Kulaib by the time his friends rushed him to the hospital at 7:30 on a Sunday morning. The 20-year-old had been shot in the chest during a skirmish at Hudaydah airport. After a brief attempt to resuscitate the fighter, a medic declared him dead.Mr. Kulaib's brother, Yahya, stood over the body in the emergency room. \"The Houthis hit us suddenly,\" he said. \"The mortars were so intense, it was hard to even retrieve his body.\"The brothers were part of the Tihama Resistance, whose fighters come from the coast \u2014 one of at least a dozen Yemeni militias, with widely divergent ideas, that fight under the coalition banner.In a corner of the emergency room, when the medics were gone, Yahya Kulaib leaned over his dead brother. He kissed him on the forehead, pulled a gray blanket across his face, then gently tied a knot in his shroud.Despite over 18,000 coalition airstrikes since 2015, the front lines remain largely unchanged. Around Hudaydah, the Houthis have seeded vast tracts of land with mines, on a scale second only to that of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, according to Conflict Armament Research.United Nations-led efforts to broker a peace have repeatedly failed \u2013 largely because sides feel they have more to gain from fighting, said Gregory D. Johnsen, a scholar on Yemen at the Arabia Foundation.\u201cYears of airstrikes failed to dislodge the Houthis, and their leaders now feel secure,\u201d Mr. Johnsen said. \u201cThey think they can wait out the Saudis.\u201dIn the meantime, a humanitarian catastrophe looms. A war-induced plunge in the value of Yemen\u2019s currency last month has hastened a steep economic collapse. The United Nations humanitarian coordinator, Lise Grande, warns that 14 million Yemenis risk starvation in the coming months.For Crown Prince Mohammed, the war ranks as a calamitous blunder, alongside the failed embargo he led against Qatar, the kidnapping of the Lebanese prime minister and now, as mounting evidence suggests, the officially sanctioned operation that led to the death of Mr. Khashoggi in Istanbul.But for Yemenis, this is their home. The fight for Hudaydah is shaping up to be the most destructive chapter of the war that has shattered their country.More brothers will bury brothers, it seems likely, before it is over.Source: Areas of control data from Critical Threats.Maps by Jeremy White.

{"Headline": "The Price of Fleeing Hurricane Michael: \u2018We Are Going to Be Financially Devastated\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe asked readers to tell us about the costs \u2014 financial, physical and emotional \u2014 of evacuating from the path of Hurricane Michael. So we did some research and asked readers to tell us about their experiences evacuating from Hurricane Michael. For some, cost was a paramount issue. For others it was minor. Below are some of their responses, which have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.If you have faced the decision whether to evacuate from a storm, please use the comments to tell us what you decided and how it worked out.The first mandatory evacuation orders were issued at 10 a.m. Monday, after forecasters at the National Hurricane Center warned that the storm was strengthening over the Gulf of Mexico.Cost: Almost $500, including $270 for three nights in a hotelI made the decision to leave my home in Panama City Beach around 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday evening. I have a 2-year-old daughter and I could not take a chance with our lives. I knew that when I left it would be days or even weeks before we could make it back home, and even then what would I be coming back to? I will be trying to get back to my home in the next day or two because I cannot afford to continue staying in a hotel.So far my costs associated with evacuation are nearing $500. My hotel costs are approximately $270 for three nights at a hotel and the rest is from gas, food and supplies. I am using credit cards to finance these costs. I have some cash but do not want to spend it because I know I may need it when I return home.\u2014 Sierra Cardenas, Panama City Beach, Fla. The governors of three states \u2014 Alabama, Florida and Georgia \u2014 declared states of emergency, and 375,000 residents in those areas were under mandatory evacuation orders. But sometimes people flee a storm only to find themselves in its eye.Cost: $200 on hotels, $250 car insurance deductibleI left my home in Walton County, one block from the Gulf, to go stay in a hotel in Callaway, Fla., where a friend, an E.R. doctor, had evacuated and invited me to stay. It was a scary feeling \u2014 the building shaking and hearing the wind. Around 5 p.m. Wednesday, the hotel staff informed everyone they had to evacuate the hotel because of the damage! I frantically packed the car and got my three cats and thought I would try to head home since I\u2019d heard my home was in good shape. I made it home safe with my fur babies and am so thankful for that. Money wasn\u2019t an issue in my situation. I am very lucky to have minimal expenses and people offering to assist. I paid around $100 for a hotel in Montgomery, Ala., that I didn\u2019t end up using and left a few items \u2014 including a large cat scratcher and precious bottled water \u2014 in the hotel when I evacuated, so maybe another $100. Geico will repair my car, which was trashed by falling debris, but I have a $250 deductible. I\u2019ll use savings or credit cards or friends and family for my relatively minimal expenses. \u2014 Antoinette Simonetti, Walton County, Fla. Cost: $750 to $800 on hotels, food, diesel and suppliesMy boyfriend and I had moved from Oregon (3,200 miles away) and had arrived six days before the storm. Tuesday morning we awoke to being told that we must evacuate immediately \u2014 we were in Zone C \u2014 so we packed up our enclosed trailer with what we brought with us, our two dogs, and drove to Pensacola! WELCOME TO FLORIDA!!!We have spent so far \u2014 on hotels, food, diesel and supplies \u2014 between $750 and $800 and we are not able to go back yet due to not being able to contact the Realtor, which is closed and dealing with its own damages and losses. Plus there\u2019s no power and no hotels with vacancies.\u2014 Kelley Gerig, Panama City, Fla. Cost: $500 for three days of lodging, food and gasWe are a military family and my husband is currently deployed, and I am six months pregnant. Members of our squadron were instrumental in preparing the house, and my mother-in-law helped pack up the pets and necessary things to evacuate. Traffic getting out of town and into Birmingham added three hours to our trip. All in all, we were very fortunate.This is the first storm for which we have ever evacuated. For lodging, food, and gas, from Tuesday to Thursday, we spent around $500. This will come from the amount of our income that we normally save each month.\u2014 Vanessa Feigel, Niceville, Fla. Cost: N/ACost was a factor, not in the sense of being able to get out, but being told by my job that if I chose to leave I wouldn\u2019t be paid. As a single mother that\u2019s a big threat, especially if it didn\u2019t turn out to be bad and we couldn\u2019t get back. That was lost work hours, and being behind on bills already, it wasn\u2019t an option.\u2014 Kelly Cuff, FloridaCost: About $1,000Early Wednesday morning the wind was howling terribly and we decided to grab what we could and our dogs and raced out of town to safety.We have a little cash and some room on credit cards, but if we don\u2019t get our regular paychecks we will be in big trouble. My bank is local to Panama City and the entire system is down, not allowing access to funds online to transfer to another institution.\u2014 Danielle Gracey, Panama City, Fla. Cost: Military covering someWe left on Monday after my husband was told to leave the area by the Air Force base. We are staying with his dad and stepmom with all of our animals. We are blessed that we have them and we were lucky that the military is paying for our gas and food. But we are going to be financially devastated with all other expenses since we didn\u2019t have much time and just grabbed enough stuff for a week. We are terrified of how our house is. It\u2019s our first to own and we put so much time, love, money and sweat into doing remodeling, and it\u2019s probably either gone or pretty much unlivable. And then there\u2019s the insurance deductible to get it fixed. I\u2019m not sure how we will be able to come up with that. We will probably be homeless.\u2014 Jody Walton, Lynn Haven, Fla.Cost: Not indicatedWe decided at the last minute to evacuate for Michael on Monday night. I taught classes all day at Florida State University and got home around 7 p.m. I rushed to throw things in a bag and we were on the road by 8:30 heading to my sister-in-law\u2019s house in Orlando. My husband had packed up our son\u2019s things during the day and secured our house. We arrived by midnight.Costs are always high for evacuating. Two years ago we evacuated for Hermine and spent four nights in a hotel. Last year we bought a lot of supplies to stay during Irma. These have been put on credit cards, which is not good. It is expensive to evacuate or prepare well to stay during these storms. The psychological toll is high, too; it is tough to \u201cgo back to normal\u201d after things like this.\u2014 Kristin Dowell, Tallahassee, Fla. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Pinsky: Patriotism for an Age of Unreason", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen things are headed in the wrong direction, it\u2019s good to remember who truly loves their country.Mr. Pinsky was the United States poet laureate from 1997 to 2000.Sometimes you read something when you are young that stays with you forever. In the 1960s, when I was barely out of my teens, that happened to me with Paul Goodman\u2019s \u201cGrowing up Absurd.\u201d Not blind to slavery, nor to the fact that Washington owned human beings, Goodman nevertheless wrote words about our first president\u2019s letter that have stayed with me for decades. \u201cIt is hard to read these sentences without agitation and tears,\u201d wrote Goodman, a self-described anarchist, \u201cfor they are simply true and simply patriotic.\u201dThe final word, so unexpected, implicitly reclaimed from scoundrel politicians like Senator Joseph McCarthy and the House Un-American Activities Committee, moved my callow soul. Patriotism didn\u2019t belong to such forces. It deserved to be embraced and protected.A few days ago I found a way \u2014 much needed \u2014 to refresh my patriotism. Almost by chance, I read again about a hero whose story had not come to mind for years.On a long car ride, in the passenger\u2019s seat, I had been talking with the driver about the current doings of Congress. I entertained her by reading aloud from my phone about Congressman Rodino. What I read \u2014 and remembered \u2014 moved me to some degree of \u201cagitation and tears.\u201dThe next bit, as our car passed through the New England countryside, moved me as an English major, a native of New Jersey and the grandson of immigrants. Childhood diphtheria left Rodino with a pronounced speech defect that he worked to correct by, in his quoted words, \u201creciting Shakespeare through a mouth full of marbles.\u201dMythology does build around politicians. \u201cBorn in a log cabin\u201d used to be the label for that. When I told a friend that Nixon financed his first campaign with poker winnings, accumulated on the Navy ship that brought him home from World War II, keeping the cash hidden in his footlocker, my friend wisely said: \u201cThat footlocker is Nixon\u2019s log cabin.\u201dBut even if those therapeutic Shakespeare recitations, the marbles, the \u201cmenial jobs\u201d are 37 percent fabricated, it is a fabrication I revere: far more heroic, to me, than any number of log cabins or foot lockers.And the next information is not myth, but fact: During World War II, Rodino was an appeals agent for the Newark Draft Board. That position exempted him from the draft, but in 1941 he enlisted in the Army and was stationed in North Africa, and later in Italy. At this point, my feelings for what I was reading merged with my memory of those long-ago televised Judiciary Committee hearings on impeachment. As chairman, Rodino seemed \u201cunlikely\u201d \u2014 a frequently applied adjective that may have implied something about the name ending in a vowel and the New Jersey accent.On July 24, 1974, the opening day of the committee debate on the articles of impeachment, amid the subpoena process for the Watergate tapes, Rodino said, with the eloquence of plain speech: \u201cWe have deliberated. We have been patient. We have been fair. Now the American people, the House of Representatives and the Constitution and the whole history of our republic demand that we make up our minds.\u201d Six of the committee\u2019s Republicans eventually joined the Democratic majority in passing three of the five articles of impeachment. After the vote, Rodino later said, he phoned his wife and wept, for our country.I concluded my reading aloud in the car with words attributed to John Doar, the special counsel to the Judiciary Committee. He said that as chairman, Mr. Rodino \u201cimposed discipline,\u201d and that \u201cthere was no partisanship on the staff. In fact, it was remarkably nonpartisan. And that is the result of good leadership.\u201d\u201cLeadership\u201d is a term I mistrust. Like \u201ccreativity\u201d it sometimes varnishes over the absence of what it means. But I feel glad to invoke it as helping me restore my grasp \u2014 in what can feel like an Age of Unreason \u2014 of the word \u201cpatriotism.\u201dRobert Pinsky, a professor of creative writing at Boston University, was the United States poet laureate from 1997 to 2000.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China May Need to Relax Its Lending Rules to Improve Economic Growth", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsChina is experiencing its slowest economic growth since 2009. Its credit system may need relaxing in order to help change that.China\u2019s gummed-up credit system is threatening economic growth and officials may have little choice but to let unregulated lenders step in.The nation\u2019s economy is not in desperate straits yet, but confidence appears shaken. The economy expanded 6.5 percent in the third quarter of 2018, missing expectations. Other indicators have suffered too: Fixed-asset investment growth has seen record lows, and retail sales have cooled.Officials have pushed for fiscal support \u2014 such as infrastructure spending \u2014 and have dropped unsubtle hints about easing the nation\u2019s deleveraging campaign. They have also suggested that banks lend more to small businesses.Unfortunately, China\u2019s banking system has a big transmission issue when it comes to offering credit to smaller borrowers. At the same time the country\u2019s correcting stock markets make it harder for private companies to raise funds via equity, or borrow using pledge shares. Bond issuance is difficult, too.Lending data for September showed that total social financing, a homegrown measure of total credit flow, increased to $320 billion, up almost 20 percent year-on-year. But when methodological changes are stripped out, aggregate lending grew only 10.6 percent \u2014 mostly from conventional loans.The problem is the weakness of so-called shadow banking \u2014 where money is provided by unregulated lenders \u2014 in China. The practice has been heavily constricted by new regulations: Two of the most important categories, new entrusted and trust loans, shrank by a combined 234 billion renminbi, or about $34 billion, in September, having contracted by 190 billion renminbi in August, according to calculations by the economist Ting Lu of Nomura.It is only a matter of time before policymakers are forced to loosen up. There is no question that China\u2019s shadow banking industry had become a place to hide a lot of poor quality loans, and officials will need to keep cleaning it up. But they cannot afford to turn it off. The shadow banking industry also functions as an efficient allocator of credit, and reviving instruments like short-term commercial paper \u2014 in particular banker\u2019s acceptance notes \u2014 could help with quick liquidity.If economic performance continues to wobble, shadow bankers will through necessity become part of the solution \u2014 not the problem.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fan Bingbing, China\u2019s Most Famous Actress, Faces Huge Fines in Tax Evasion", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China accused the country\u2019s most famous actress, Fan Bingbing, of evading millions of dollars in taxes and warned others in the television and film industry to come clean or face a similar fate, according to a statement released to state media on Wednesday.The authorities fined Ms. Fan, 37, the equivalent of nearly $70 million in unpaid taxes and penalties after an investigation found that she and employees of her production company had underreported her earnings from her blockbuster films \u2014 a practice that is said to be common in China, and not only in the entertainment industry.The tax authorities in Beijing and Jiangsu, the province where her production company is based, said that since this was Ms. Fan\u2019s first offense, she would not face criminal charges as long as she and her company paid her fine and an additional $60 million in back taxes owed by her company.\u201cI have been through pain and suffering I have never had before,\u201d Ms. Fan wrote in a post on Weibo, the Twitter-like website, her first since June 2. \u201cI have had deep and profound self-reflection. I feel shamed and guilty for what I have done.\u201dOthers will face charges, though. In a statement released to the state news media, the authorities cited potentially criminal actions by the company\u2019s employees, including obstruction of the tax investigation. The statement said that one person \u2014 her agent, Mou Enguang, according to news reports \u2014 was taken into custody.Ms. Fan\u2019s prominence suggests that the authorities intended to send a broader signal with the investigation.As China\u2019s economy boomed, the government has struggled to collect taxes from private companies and individuals. Problems with taxation have become more urgent as the country encounters new economic headwinds, after years of uninterrupted growth.Tax evasion is so rampant that enforcement, when it does occur, is often seen as arbitrary or politically motivated.When it comes to the entertainment industry, which is heavily censored in China, the government is particularly sensitive to the influence its stars\u2019 behavior can have \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 on public opinion.The State Tax Administration warned in the statement that others in the entertainment industry could also face investigations unless they stepped forward to declare untaxed income. It set a deadline of Dec. 31, promising that those who complied voluntarily would not have to pay penalties.For Ms. Fan, the reputational damage has already been done. She was, until this summer, one of the most recognizable women in China, having appeared in dozens of movies and television series and achieved global recognition with roles in the \u201cX-Men\u201d and \u201cIron Man\u201d franchises.The fate of that role, as well as numerous branding contracts that were abruptly canceled or suspended since then, remains to be seen. Her current whereabouts is not known, though there have been unsubstantiated reports that she has been detained during the course of the investigation.Ms. Fan\u2019s abrupt fall from public grace has been one of the biggest news sensations in China in recent months, worrying fans and colleagues while delighting others who relished the travails of a rich celebrity.In commentary that censors appeared to be trying to suppress, people reacted online on Wednesday with both gleeful disdain and also incredulity that so large an instance of tax evasion merited only a fine.\u201cOrdinary people who earn a little salary still need to pay taxes honestly,\u201d one user on Weibo wrote.The practice of having dual contracts \u2014 known as \u201cyin and yang\u201d contracts \u2014 is widespread in many industries. Mr. Cui\u2019s anger appeared to be directed as much toward the director of \u201cCell Phone,\u201d Feng Xiaogang, as toward Ms. Fan. Mr. Cui previously had accused him of slander because the plot \u2014 in which a prominent television anchor has an affair with an assistant, played by Ms. Fan \u2014 bore striking, though he said inaccurate, parallels to Mr. Cui\u2019s own career.In that case, the authorities said, Ms. Fan signed an actual contract for 20 million yuan, nearly $3 million, but declared only 10 million yuan in the contract submitted to the tax authorities.The film\u2019s release, originally scheduled for August, has also been delayed, and her role reportedly edited out.In addition to her apology, Ms. Fan offered an extraordinary statement of fealty to the state and the Communist Party which controls it for her career successes so far.\u201cWithout the party and the state\u2019s good policies, without the love from the people, there would have been no Fan Bingbing,\u201d she wrote.Austin Ramzy contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "How Trump Could Fatally Weaken the Dollar", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen the president undermines the rule of law and the independence of institutions like the Fed, he threatens a pillar of American economic strength.Mr. Prasad is the author of \u201cThe Dollar Trap: How the U.S. Dollar Tightened Its Grip on Global Finance.\u201dFor now, they are out of luck. The American economy and financial markets are the largest in the world, and there are no good alternatives.In the long run, however, the rest of the world might get its wish. The dollar\u2019s status as the dominant global reserve currency is the result of faith in America\u2019s strong institutions. This includes the checks and balances among different arms of government, the rule of law and an independent central bank. These institutions have proved durable and earned the trust of global investors, who see the dollar as a safe haven in troubled times. But President Trump and his acolytes are undermining those very institutions with their words and actions.Other countries have long chafed at the dollar\u2019s dominance in global finance. Nearly two-thirds of the foreign exchange reserves held by the world\u2019s central banks\u2019, essentially their rainy-day funds, are held in dollars. It is the currency used to denominate and settle a significant part of international financial transactions. Almost all commodity contracts, including those for oil, are priced and settled in dollars.This gives the United States a lot of power. Since dollar transactions usually involve the American banking system, the United States government can put a chokehold on countries like Iran and Russia by limiting their access to global finance.In the past, none of this would have made a dent in the dollar\u2019s dominance. No other country has the unmatchable combination of size, trust and influence enjoyed by the United States. The global ripple effects of last week\u2019s stock market fluctuations were a clear illustration.But the Trump administration, and its allies in Congress, are wreaking havoc on the institutions that have made the dollar dominant for so long.The rule of law is being eviscerated by an administration that is openly venal and sees itself as above the law. And stacking the courts with judges who are chosen for their willingness to advance a particular agenda is eroding confidence in the judicial system.The dollar\u2019s dominance may outlast the Trump era, but it is not inevitable. If the president continues to hack away at America\u2019s institutions, the dollar, too, will suffer. This might end up becoming one of the biggest scars the administration leaves on the American economy.Eswar Prasad is a professor at Cornell University, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and author of \u201cThe Dollar Trap: How the U.S. Dollar Tightened Its Grip on Global Finance.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Leading an Active Life With a Diagnosis of Dementia", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRetiringAfter a \u201cself-inflicted pity party,\u201d Mrs. Scherrer said, she sprang into action. She created plans that would enable her to pursue an active life while also protecting her as the disease progressed.\u201cOnce I accepted the changes my life was going to take, I began to appreciate the joy and beauty around me,\u201d she said.On the legal front, for example, a lawyer drew up documents that designated Mrs. Scherrer\u2019s husband, a brother and a cousin to make medical and financial decisions for her when she can no longer handle her own affairs.A key to prolonging independence, participants told her, is to recognize the triggers that aggravate her symptoms and to adjust her routine to head them off. One strategy: Because noise in a grocery store can cause confusion, Mrs. Scherrer shops in the early morning, when the store is quieter.Most important, she said, the group taught her she \u201ccan still live a meaningful, happy life, at least for now.\u201dMrs. Scherrer has bad days when she is \u201ccrying because I don\u2019t know where I am,\u201d she said, but \u201cI have a passion now, and that passion keeps me going.\u201dHer advocacy could well help other baby boomers who are reaching the age when the risk for dementia rises. The number of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease who are 65 or older is projected to climb to 7.1 million in 2025 and 13.8 million in 2050, up from 5.5 million today, according to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association. An additional 200,000 people younger than 65 are estimated to have Alzheimer\u2019s. These numbers do not include those with vascular, Lewy body and other types of dementia.A challenging question for families is whether the person with dementia can understand and sign legal documents. The critical documents are financial and health care powers of attorney. The person\u2019s lawyer could seek a clinical evaluation to determine whether the client still has the decision-making skills to execute these and other documents, Dr. Marson said.Acting quickly is essential because many types of dementia progress over time. \u201cEven mildly impaired persons usually need to be carefully evaluated before signing legal documents,\u201d Dr. Marson said.Another important document is an advance-care directive, which typically provides guidance on end-of-life treatment. A person with dementia may live for a long time after a diagnosis, however, and may choose to provide guidance for the many years of incapacitation. For example, instructions could include details on the patient\u2019s preferences for care settings or caregivers.\u201cMy kids know that if I have dementia and a clinical trial might work, I\u2019m down for that,\u201d said Ronald Fatoullah, an elder-law attorney in Great Neck, N.Y.Mrs. Scherrer said she had directed her agents to withhold treatment under certain circumstances for serious illnesses like cancer.\u201cIf I have another disease that is life threatening, I may try one treatment to see what happens,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it makes my dementia worse, no more.\u201dFor example, you may be able to cash out a life insurance policy or exchange a policy for an annuity that pays tax-free income, he said.\u201cWe go through the different levels of care, and what each level costs, and then we plan for the worst-case scenario,\u201d Mr. Kim said.For some people in the early stages, it makes sense to protect assets from long-term care costs. Medicaid, which is financed by state and federal governments, pays for care for people with limited assets, though state laws differ. To get below the limits, Mr. Fatoullah said, he may draw up a power-of-attorney document that could allow an agent to set up asset preservation trusts, which would pay for services not covered by Medicaid, and to make gifts to family members.\u201cA client may have promised his daughter he would pay for medical school,\u201d he said.The gifts must be made more than five years before a Medicaid application is made (30 months in California), or there could be penalties \u2014 another reason to visit a lawyer soon after a diagnosis.As financial acuity declines, the chance of elder financial abuse rises. Choosing a trusted friend or relative as a financial agent is essential; a second agent, perhaps a bank trust department, can act as a check and balance.When Shawn Kelley\u2019s Lewy body dementia was diagnosed in April 2017, he said, his sister and brother pitched in to manage his money.\u201cMy cognitive skills are not great with finances,\u201d said Mr. Kelley, 59, of Norfolk, Va., who is single and a former manager of a grocery store floral department. \u201cI feel very blessed. They\u2019ve taken a lot of pressure off me.\u201dMonths without a job depleted much of Mr. Kelley\u2019s savings. Proceeds from two disability policies and Social Security Disability Insurance pay for expenses. When he can no longer live alone in his two-bedroom house, Mr. Kelley said, he hopes a friend or relative will move in.\u201cFor long-term care, I would have to rely on government assistance to fill in the gaps,\u201d he said.The Scherrers expect at some point to sell their four-bedroom house. A smaller place would be easier to manage and free up cash for long-term care. Though Mrs. Scherrer has checked out assisted living facilities, she said members of her family had promised to care for her at home for as long as possible.For those who prefer to meet in person, many chapters of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association offer early-stage support groups where individuals and caregivers can socialize.\u201cWhen they meet other people going through this, they don\u2019t feel so isolated and alone,\u201d she said.Though Mrs. Scherrer sometimes forgets how to perform what used to be routine tasks like cooking, she generally keeps busy with her advocacy and gardening. Her to-do list includes scuba diving in South America and an R.V. trip with relatives to New England.And she feels confident that her financial and legal plans, along with a supportive family, will keep her safe as symptoms worsen. Until then, Mrs. Scherrer said, \u201cI still have so much to do.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the time frame for applying for Medicaid and making asset transfers. Gifts or asset transfers must be made more than five years before a person applies for Medicaid, not within five years of applying.Advertisement"}

But men are now being seen as more risky hires.\u201dBut the analysis shows that the #MeToo movement shook, and is still shaking, power structures in society\u2019s most visible sectors. The Times gathered cases of prominent people who lost their main jobs, significant leadership positions or major contracts, and whose ousters were publicly covered in news reports.Forty-three percent of their replacements were women. Of those, one-third are in news media, one-quarter in government, and one-fifth in entertainment and the arts. For example, Robin Wright replaced Kevin Spacey as lead actor on \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d Emily Nemens replaced Lorin Stein as editor of \u201cThe Paris Review,\u201d and Tina Smith replaced Al Franken as a senator from Minnesota.People Replacing Men Accused of Sexual MisconductWomen are starting to gain power in organizations that have been jolted by harassment, with potentially far-reaching effects.\u201cI find it so interesting the number of people who come up to me and say, \u2018Thank you for stepping in when someone needed to step in,\u2019\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of what women do a lot of the time, right?\u201dThat has been true in Congress, said Ms. Smith, a Democrat. In a highly polarized Senate, women tend to be unusually collegial across party lines, she said, and the 23 female senators meet for dinner monthly.U.S. senator for MinnesotaResigned after accusations of groping and improper advances from at least six women. He apologized but denied many of the allegations.Interim\u201cI believe you\u2019re successful and you get things done if you have relationships with people,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the ground for accomplishing something, certainly in the legislative world.\u201dOne example: She and Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican from Alaska, discovered that they both worked on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in high school. The bond they built from shared experience helped them when they co-sponsored mental health legislation that was included in the opioid crisis response bill passed last month.In news media and entertainment, many women who ascended to jobs vacated by men have changed the tone and substance of what they offer audiences \u2014 and in some cases, the fallout from #MeToo has shaped their decisions.Head of Amazon StudiosResigned after a Hollywood producer accused him of making unwanted sexual advances.InterimPermanentSince Tanzina Vega took over from John Hockenberry as host of \u201cThe Takeaway,\u201d the public radio program, she has done many episodes about gender, including on masculinity, women\u2019s anger and the intersection of gender and race \u2014 topics that she had been covering for years but that she said were now part of the national conversation.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily because I\u2019m a woman, but it\u2019s just that as a woman, as a Latina, I know when the conversation hasn\u2019t been about women, and I\u2019m deeply sensitive to that,\u201d said Ms. Vega, who was previously a reporter at CNN and The New York Times.Host of WNYC\u2019s \u201cThe Takeaway\u201dAfter he left \u201cThe Takeaway,\u201d nine women accused Mr. Hockenberry of sexual harassment, including unwelcome sexual advances.

More than 10 percent of the ousted men have tried to make a comeback, or voiced a desire to, and many never lost financial power.When people accused of harassment return to power without making amends \u2014 or never lose it, at least financially \u2014 it limits the post-Weinstein movement\u2019s potential to change how power is exercised in American society.\u201cWhere\u2019s the self-reflection and accountability?\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps if we saw some evidence of that, then we can have a more robust conversation about the road to redemption.\u201dIn the meantime, these women say, there are more than enough qualified women ready to take their places in power.\u201cA bunch of us who took over these jobs got promoted because we were really good at these jobs,\u201d said Ms. Vega, the radio host. \u201cWe have the skills, we have the experience, we have the work ethic and we have the smarts to do it, and it\u2019s time for us to do this job.\u201dThe 98 Men Who Were ReplacedOf the men who lost their jobs, 51 have been replaced by at least one woman in an interim or permanent capacity.

(At the end of October, live music will switch to Saturday nights.)Mr. Gold, who is from Briarwood, Queens, was working on a glass of SingleCut\u2019s Heavy Boots of Lead. \u201cIt has notes of chocolate,\u201d he said, as Mr. Weinstein, who lives up the block from the brewery, continued belting out lyrics. SingleCut has been featuring live local bands since shortly after it opened in 2012.Most acts are rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, which is fitting, since Rich Buceta, the owner, sold his collection of vintage guitars to finance the brewery, which he named after the style of instrument he favors. (A \u201csingle cut\u201d has one cutaway on the body of the guitar, like a Gibson Les Paul, where a Fender Stratocaster has a double cutaway.)The Spartan space, which has a concrete floor and barstool-height tables that can be rolled out of the way during beer production, opens to the sidewalk. Bands play in a small, cagelike stage in a corner near the ceiling.Known for its 1933 Pilsner and New England India pale ales, SingleCut sells glasses for $6 to $8. Its rotating pop-up restaurants offer a variety of fare; dumplings and bao sandwiches, on the menu for Beatles night, were $6 to $8.The brewery, whose front faces a small strip mall anchored by a Best Market, is in an industrial corridor that includes the Steinway & Sons piano factory and a Con Edison plant. A 15-minute walk from the Ditmars stop on the N/W line, it\u2019s a bear to get to even for locals.\u201cIt\u2019s not on the way to many places except La Guardia Airport and Rikers Island,\u201d said Jerzy Gwiazdowski, a bartender who also books the bands. \u201cThere\u2019s a strong neighborhood vibe, and the East Coast craft beer scene brings people from around the world.\u201dJoe Ammon, who was sipping a SingleCut kolsch, didn\u2019t mind that it took him a subway, a bus and a long walk from Greenpoint, Brooklyn. \u201cI\u2019m familiar with the brand because the bottle shops in Brooklyn sell it,\u201d he said.Rich Miller, whose dark hair was held back in a ponytail that reached the middle of his back, also makes the trek regularly. A mechanic at JFK, he comes after work, which can take an hour and a half; after that, he really does need a beer.\u201cI\u2019ve been singing really loudly, louder than the band,\u201d he said, not realizing that he was stating the obvious.Later in the evening, Mr. Miller, who is 49 and lives upstate in Newburgh, had let his hair down and was dancing vigorously while cuddling a glass of beer that was three-quarters full. Surprisingly, he didn\u2019t spill a drop.Across the room, Melonie Strimple, 2\u00bd and a lifelong Beatles fan and Astoria resident, was bopping with the beats.She didn\u2019t have a hard time persuading her parents, Ian and Macy, to come with her. SingleCut was a part of Mr. Strimple\u2019s life long before Melonie was \u2014 he had his bachelor party here.Between sets, Ms. Strimple sang \u201cAll You Need Is Love\u201d to Melonie, who was wearing noise-knockout earmuffs.Mr. Strimple took Melonie in his arms and placed her on the floor. While the band played \u201cI Want to Hold Your Hand,\u201d he grabbed hers for a daddy-daughter dance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How to Make Trump-Style Wealth Pay Its Fair Share", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongress has a variety of tools for blocking tax cheats. It should use them.Ms. Batchelder is a professor of law at the New York University School of Law.This raises two questions. First, what can and should tax authorities do about the specific allegations of tax evasion and fraud by the Trump family detailed in the article? Second, what can lawmakers do to ensure that those who inherit extraordinary sums are paying their fair share?The estate tax is also riddled with loopholes, which the 2017 law did nothing to address. For example, the Times article details how the Trumps used valuation discounts and something called a grantor-retained annuity trust to sharply reduce their gift and estate tax bill. The Obama administration proposed regulations to address abuses of valuation discounts, and legislation to address abuses of grantor-retained annuity trusts. Unsurprisingly, the Trump administration quickly withdrew both proposals.Mr. Trump inherited an empire built on tax evasion. Perhaps we cannot recoup all the taxes he and his family owed. But we can use their example as a call to restructure our tax system so it taxes people who work for their money less heavily \u2014 not more \u2014 than those born with a golden spoon in their mouth.Lily Batchelder, a professor of law at the New York University School of Law, was majority chief tax counsel for the Senate Finance Committee from 2010 to 2014.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "New York Regulators Examine the Trump Family\u2019s Tax Schemes", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNew York City officials said on Thursday that they had joined state regulators in examining whether President Trump and his family underpaid taxes on his father\u2019s real estate empire over several decades.The announcement came in response to an investigation published this week in The New York Times that showed how Mr. Trump had participated in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud, that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents.\u201cWe are now just starting to pore through the information,\u201d said Dean Fuleihan, the city\u2019s first deputy mayor.One type of tax that the city will examine is the real estate transfer tax. Officials said the extremely low valuations the Trump family placed on buildings that passed from Fred C. Trump to his children through trusts could have resulted in underpaid transfer taxes.The Times reported that through several aggressive and potentially illegal maneuvers, the Trumps claimed that 25 apartment complexes transferred to Donald Trump and his siblings from their father were worth just $41.4 million. The Trumps sold those buildings within a decade for more than 16 times that amount.Mr. Fuleihan said the city would also explore whether another tax avoidance maneuver by Mr. Trump and his siblings resulted in Fred Trump\u2019s empire underpaying property taxes.That maneuver involved a company, created by the Trump family in 1992, called All County Building Supply & Maintenance. All County existed largely on paper, The Times found. Its work, such as it was, consisted of adding 20 percent or more to the cost of goods and services bought by Fred Trump. The padded amount was split between Donald Trump and his siblings, essentially a gift from their father that avoided the 55 percent gift tax at the time.Mr. Fuleihan said the scheme as described by The Times would have artificially driven down the profitability of Fred Trump\u2019s buildings. And because city property taxes on rental buildings are based in part on profits reported by owners, All County would have had the effect of lowering the property tax burden.Mr. Fuleihan said city and state agencies are cooperating on the effort. The State Department of Taxation and Finance announced on Wednesday that it was \u201cpursuing all appropriate avenues of investigation.\u201dMr. Trump did not respond to requests for an interview for The Times\u2019s article, but a lawyer for the president, Charles J. Harder, said in a statement that \u201cthere was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone.\u201dAnother state agency is looking into whether tenants in Fred Trump\u2019s rent-regulated apartments saw their rents unduly increased because the Trumps used the padded All County invoices to apply for rent increases, as The Times found. State regulations allow owners of rent-regulated buildings to apply for increases to recover the \u201cactual and verified cost\u201d of some improvements to buildings, said Freeman Klopott, a spokesman for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal.The agency can refer cases of landlords found to be submitting false receipts to the state attorney general.A growing number of Democrats in Congress, meanwhile, cited the article in renewing their longstanding demands for Mr. Trump to release his income tax returns, something he has steadfastly declined to do, breaking with four decades of practice by previous presidents.And Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon and the ranking member of the Finance Committee, asked the I.R.S. on Wednesday to open an investigation into The Times\u2019s findings. \u201cIt is imperative that I.R.S. fully investigate these allegations and prosecute any violations to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in a statement.A spokesman for the I.R.S. said the agency would not comment on whether it was taking any action in response to The Times\u2019s investigation.Some of the Trumps\u2019 tax evasion maneuvers uncovered by The Times warranted investigation as potential crimes, former prosecutors said, but the statute of limitations on any such charges has long since expired.The inquiries will explore whether civil penalties and bills for back taxes are warranted. City officials said interest and penalties of up to 25 percent could be added to any unpaid taxes.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Walter Kwok, Hong Kong Developer Who Survived Kidnapping, Dies at 68", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 Walter Kwok, a Hong Kong property tycoon who was kidnapped and held for ransom in 1997 and later ousted, in a dramatic family conflict, from the business his father had founded, died on Saturday in Hong Kong. He was 68.Mr. Kwok was one of Hong Kong\u2019s most prominent developers when he was targeted by a mainland gangster who had an audacious plan to kidnap the city\u2019s richest businessmen and ransom them for tens of millions of dollars.The gangster, Cheung Tze-keung, known by the nickname Big Spender for his profligate ways in Macau casinos, kidnapped Mr. Kwok in September 1997, nearly three months after Hong Kong was returned to Chinese control.Mr. Kwok was held in a hut in a remote area of Hong Kong\u2019s New Territories. The kidnappers beat him and locked him in a wooden cage after he initially refused to call his family. He was released a week later for a ransom of nearly $80 million.The year before, the same gang had kidnapped Victor Li, the son of the tycoon Li Ka-shing, who was freed after a ransom of about $125 million was paid.Mr. Cheung\u2019s 1998 trial, in the mainland city of Guangzhou, was closely followed in Hong Kong. It revealed new details of the kidnappings, which had not been reported to the police. He was convicted and executed in December 1998.Walter Kwok Ping-sheung was born in 1950, the eldest son of Kwok Tak-seng, who in 1963 founded Sun Hung Kai Properties. It became one of the city\u2019s biggest development companies, building apartment complexes and developing what are now some of Hong Kong\u2019s most famous commercial buildings, including its two tallest, the International Commerce Center and the International Finance Center.Mr. Kwok said he had suffered from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder after his kidnapping, and his brothers increasingly took on the company\u2019s day-to-day operations.In 2008, the Kwok family moved to oust him as head of the company in a bitter battle that thrust them into the headlines again. His brothers asserted in court filings that Mr. Kwok had bipolar affective disorder and argued that the condition should disqualify him from running the conglomerate. They also said that Mr. Kwok\u2019s mistress had become inappropriately involved in company business.Mr. Kwok responded that his brothers were upset with his efforts to improve the company\u2019s management, including starting an examination of whether certain contractors were unduly favored.The company\u2019s board voted to remove him, and his mother took over as chairwoman. In 2014 the brothers reached a settlement to divide the family trust that controls Sun Hung Kai, which was valued at more than $33 billion.Mr. Kwok had recently tried to renegotiate that settlement, arguing that the properties he received had not appreciated as quickly as those of his brothers.Mr. Kwok remained a nonexecutive board member until 2014. He also founded his own development company, Empire Group Holdings.Thomas Kwok was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison for paying more than $1 million and providing other benefits to Mr. Hui. Raymond Kwok was acquitted.Walter Kwok, who was arrested but never charged in the case, sought to distance himself from the scandal, saying he had not been involved in employing Mr. Hui. The family conflict prompted speculation in Hong Kong that he had tipped off the authorities about the bribery, but such a link was never proved.Besides his wife, Mr. Kwok is survived by his two brothers and three children.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Far-Right Candidate Jair Bolsonaro Widens Lead in Brazil\u2019s Presidential Race", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Jair Bolsonaro, the populist, far-right candidate leading the pack, spent much of the final stretch in a hospital bed, convalescing from a near-fatal stabbing, occasionally posting selfies and shaky videos in which he looked feeble and groggy. His near-disappearance from the political stage only increased his lead: polls suggest Mr. Bolsonaro will trounce opponents in the election on Sunday.His success has defied the laws of political gravity. Until recently, Mr. Bolsonaro was a provocateur on the fringes of power who accomplished little as a seven-term lawmaker, but made headlines by calling for a military dictatorship and verbally attacking women, gays and people of color \u2014 in a country that is mostly nonwhite.Until early August, he did not even have a running mate because traditional parties and politicians found him toxic.But much like President Trump and populist leaders around the world, Mr. Bolsonaro has tapped into a deep well of resentment at the political establishment. He channeled Brazilians\u2019 anger over staggering levels of corruption and crime, presenting himself as the only candidate tough enough to solve them.\u201cBrazilians want a hero,\u201d said Daniel Machado, a professor of political marketing, referring to Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s vow to take radical measures to fix Brazil.\u201cWe need to break that system together,\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro, 63, told followers earlier this week during one of his daily live videos on Facebook.A year ago, most power brokers in Brazil regarded Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s presidential bid as fanciful, deeming him too incendiary to take the helm of the world\u2019s fourth largest democracy. Veteran political strategists and analysts thought his appeal would ebb as the campaign season officially kicked off in August.After all, Mr. Bolsonaro is also the most reviled contender in the field, with a 45 percent disapproval rate. But as Election Day approaches, centrist candidates with larger war chests and robust networks of support are seeing their political base drift toward Mr. Bolsonaro.His popularity only grew after he was stabbed while being carried by supporters during a political rally in September. The assailant told police officers at the scene that he was carrying out \u201can order from God,\u201d which led investigators to question his mental health. But the attack played into Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s message about the need to get tough on crime, analysts said.But many of his backers argue that he represents the only way to defeat the most powerful and corrupt presence on the Brazilian political scene in recent years \u2014 the leftist Workers\u2019 Party, which governed from 2003 to 2016.When the presidential race got underway, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a charismatic former metal worker and founding member of the Workers\u2019 Party, was the front-runner by a wide margin. Many Brazilians, particularly the poor and the working class in this deeply unequal country, identify with Mr. da Silva personally and long for the prosperity they experienced during his tenure. He stepped down in 2011 with record-high approval ratings.Since then, the party\u2019s standing has slipped. Mr. da Silva\u2019s successor, Dilma Rousseff, oversaw the deepest recession in Brazil\u2019s history. She was impeached in 2016 for obscuring a budget deficit.So less than a month before Election Day, the Workers\u2019 Party officially nominated Fernando Haddad, a former education minister and mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, betting that Mr. da Silva\u2019s base would transfer its allegiance to him. This was effective enough to push Mr. Haddad \u2014 a 55-year-old economist, lawyer and history professor with little national name recognition \u2014 into second place in the polls.The matchup between Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. Haddad has crystallized a bitter societal divide in Brazil that has widened in recent years amid the economic woes and public disgust at bribery schemes that tainted much of the political and business elite.While foes see a Bolsonaro presidency as potentially catastrophic for the country\u2019s young democracy, his supporters warn that returning the Workers\u2019 Party to power would put Brazil on the type of ruinous path that has engulfed neighboring Venezuela.\u201cI lived through the era of the dictatorship and not even then did I witness so much hate, so much division, so much aggression,\u201d said Clara Strauss, 79, during a recent demonstration against Mr. Bolsonaro. \u201cIt\u2019s not characteristic of Brazilians.\u201dBrazilians are distrustful of more than just politicians. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolsonaro has sowed skepticism and at times outright hostility toward the press. He has dismissed critical stories \u2014 including investigations into his real estate holdings and a messy divorce \u2014 as \u201cfake news.\u201d That approach has resonated with many Brazilians who see large news organizations as beholden to the elite.Karine Neder, 45, an interior designer from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais state, said she started leaning toward Mr. Bolsonaro as media coverage of him became increasingly negative in recent months. She became a fervent admirer as Mr. Bolsonaro vowed to take drastic measures to restore security, like tougher prison sentences.\u201cWe live in a country where you can\u2019t watch the national news at night without being afraid of going to work the next day,\u201d she said after attending a rally for the candidate in Rio de Janeiro.While rivals enjoyed considerably more free airtime on television \u2014 which is allocated according to a political party\u2019s size \u2014 and spent heavily on polished ads, Mr. Bolsonaro proved very adept at using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to reach voters.\u201cHe had the time and this new, unfettered space to occupy the collective imagination,\u201d Mr. Machado, the professor of political marketing, said.Bolsonaro fans created hundreds of group chats on the messaging app WhatsApp, which has become a prodigious channel to spread misinformation during elections in Latin America.Mr. Bolsonaro is considered a conservative for his hard-line approach to security, his staunch opposition to abortion rights and his disdain for the type of affirmative action initiatives the Workers\u2019 Party created to chip away at Brazil\u2019s steep inequality.But how he would manage the economy \u2014 the world\u2019s eighth largest \u2014 remains unclear.Mr. Bolsonaro and his surrogates have offered few detailed policy prescriptions and have backed contradictory positions on central issues, such as whether large state enterprises should be privatized.The policy blueprint on his campaign website is heavy on exclamation marks and short on details. \u201cOur strategy will be to adopt the same actions that work in countries that are booming, with jobs, low inflation, wages for workers and opportunity for all,\u201d his policy document proclaims.Mr. Bolsonaro has reacted with exasperation when interviewers have pressed him for details on how he would handle the economy, which is only now emerging from the recession.\u201cI\u2019m an artillery captain,\u201d he barked during a recent televised interview on the Globo News network. \u201cWhy would I talk about the economy?\u201dMany experts see him as ill equipped to tackle complex challenges that will ultimately need to be addressed, including pension and tax reform.\u201cThe military, when they took power in \u201864, and established a dictatorship, had a plan,\u201d said Helo\u00edsa Starling, a historian at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. \u201cWe may have disagreed with it, but they had a plan. He doesn\u2019t have a plan for the country.\u201dBut that has not fazed investors. They appear to have faith that Paulo Guedes, a University of Chicago-educated economist whom Mr. Bolsonaro has said he would appoint as finance minister, would push market-friendly reforms and rein in the social spending that mushroomed under the Workers\u2019 Party. As Mr. Bolsonaro has surged in the polls, markets have rallied, with stocks and the real currency rebounding.As a Bolsonaro victory has appeared increasingly likely, ardent opponents have rallied online and in the streets under the motto #EleN\u00e3o, or Not Him. But the demonstrations have not dented his support, which has left many of those who ardently oppose him feeling despondent.\u201cWe used to think that rights that have been conquered were rights that had been consolidated,\u201d said Ms. Schwarcz, the historian. \u201cI\u2019ve concluded that we were being foolish. We must continue fighting for them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats in an All-Hands-on-Deck Scramble to Save Menendez in New Jersey", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUNION BEACH, N.J. \u2014 It was a rare convergence of New Jersey\u2019s governor and its two senators for an official event meant to be about policy, not politics.\u201cI don\u2019t know where we would be without Senator Bob Menendez,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. He was followed by Senator Cory Booker, who offered his own lofty praise: \u201cWhen I look to the future of this state, we need Bob Menendez.\u201dDemocrats are poised to win a number of governorships across the country and perhaps control of the House on Tuesday, thanks in large part to a suburban backlash to President Trump. But in a state rich with commuters and cul-de-sacs, party leaders are being forced to mount a last-minute, all-hands-on-deck effort to rescue Mr. Menendez\u2019s candidacy and preserve their long-shot dreams of a Senate majority.Allies of Mr. Menendez said his indictment and eventual trial made fund-raising difficult because nearly all of the money he raised was for his legal defense fund. And in the face of a self-funder like Mr. Hugin, Mr. Menendez had no choice but to rely on outside help.In Washington, Democrats grew increasingly alarmed when in mid-October their own internal polling indicated that Mr. Menendez\u2019s lead had fallen to only two points. Continuing to watch their scandal-tarred incumbent be outspent by seven to one was not a risk national Democrats were willing to take, especially given the prospect that they could take back the Senate in 2020 if they do not lose significant ground this year.So, perhaps grudgingly, the party\u2019s Senate super PAC began spending in a state where there are 900,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans. And it intended to continue its ad campaign through Election Day.The concern among Democrats is being met with unbridled confidence from the Hugin campaign.\u201cIf the election were today, I would have won,\u201d said Mr. Hugin, referring to an internal poll that his campaign would not share publicly, but that he said had him leading by a small margin with 12 days left in the election.Public polls show that Mr. Menendez is maintaining a single-digit lead, and top strategists in both parties, in New Jersey and in Washington, believe that the Democratic tilt this year in states with high-income demographics like New Jersey will ultimately prove to be the incumbent\u2019s salvation. No Republican has won a Senate election in the state since 1972, and many on the right believe that, no matter the Democrat on the ballot, these kinds of races inevitably prove to be fool\u2019s gold.\u201cEvery two to four years, we see a football, and Lucy, being the New Jersey voters, kind of lifts the football,\u201d said Doug Heye, a former spokesman for the Republican National Committee.But the fact that state and national Democrats have had to rush to Mr. Menendez\u2019s aid illustrates the shift of strength here to the suburbs \u2014 and the dwindling tolerance such voters have for extended exposure to the seamier side of New Jersey\u2019s transactional politics and powerful political machines.\u201cI\u2019m disappointed that they didn\u2019t put someone better in that situation,\u201d said Joy Wodziak, 63, of Morris Township, during a rally for Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic candidate for Congress in New Jersey\u2019s northern 11th District. \u201cHe possibly could have stepped down.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Ms. Wodziak is the type of voter energizing the suburbs for Democrats like Ms. Sherrill. An \u201cindependent for 40 years,\u201d she said she registered as a Democrat this year specifically to vote for Ms. Sherrill in the primaries. She cited the roots of her newfound political motivation in the women\u2019s march the day after Mr. Trump\u2019s inauguration.But while she is energized by Ms. Sherrill, Ms. Wodziak also vowed to vote Democratic up and down the ticket, for \u201cchecks and balances\u201d on Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s hold your nose and vote,\u201d she said of Mr. Menendez.State party leaders are worried that even an outsize, albeit reluctant suburban vote may not be enough to ensure Mr. Menendez\u2019s survival, and that he is not wholly on the mind of supporters of Ms. Sherrill and Andy Kim, the Democratic challenger in the razor-thin race in the state\u2019s Third District. While Ms. Sherrill and Mr. Kim are coordinating voter turnout efforts statewide, neither has held a public event with Mr. Menendez since the primary in June.Mr. Murphy and the state Democratic Party are instead putting an emphasis on the need for an exceptionally strong turnout in northeastern New Jersey, particularly in the Democratic strongholds of Hudson, Bergen, Essex and Passaic Counties. Democrats hold such an advantage in the House districts there that low voter turnout could hamper Mr. Menendez\u2019s efforts.So on Sunday, with only nine days left before the election, the senator and governor held multiple campaign events in Jersey City, one of the dense population centers that will be key to Mr. Menendez\u2019s re-election.\u201cHudson County is incredibly important in terms of turnout to achieve the goal of getting Senator Menendez re-elected,\u201d Mr. Murphy said at a bar in Jersey City, as dozens of supporters snacked on quesadillas, listened to stump speeches and watched the New York Jets lose. \u201cAnd it\u2019s particularly challenging because there isn\u2019t necessarily a lot of down-ballot competitive stuff in a lot of the communities in Hudson County. So, it puts even more emphasis and impetus on events like this and getting the turnout, particularly among young people. That\u2019s the big plea I have among you all.\u201dThe math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.On the campaign trail and on the airwaves, Mr. Menendez has shifted his closing argument to focus nearly entirely on tying Mr. Hugin to Mr. Trump.\u201cWe have a president who has a direct hit on New Jersey,\u201d Mr. Menendez said on Sunday. \u201cWe can\u2019t have someone in the Senate who will join him.\u201dHis Republican opponent, knowing how unpopular Mr. Trump is, has been trying to resist having the president wrapped around him.More and more, Mr. Hugin has been campaigning as an \u201cindependent Republican,\u201d a phrase he uses often in front of voters.

{"Headline": "A Push for Safer Fertilizer in Europe Carries a Whiff of Russian Intrigue", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The trade group Safer Phosphates would seem to have a pitch-perfect message for an environmentally conscious European Union. It advocates cleaner soil and healthier food, with a website showing pristine fields of wheat. It is also supporting legislation that would place tighter regulations on fertilizer.But the group is not run by environmentalists. Its driving force is a Russian fertilizer giant that has ties to the Kremlin. And the environmental legislation it is backing would reset regulations in a way that could help the company, PhosAgro, push aside rivals and give it greater influence over the European food supply.Fertilizer might not seem an obvious source of geopolitical tension. But with Moscow working openly and covertly to widen its sphere of power, the prospect of a politically connected Russian company cornering a key part of the European agricultural market has raised sharp concerns. Russia already wields tremendous clout as the European Union\u2019s dominant provider of natural gas and as a growing source of nuclear fuel.After years of lobbying, European officials could move forward on new regulations as early as this week, when representatives of the three governing bodies of the European Union meet in Strasbourg, France. A debate that was supposed to be about environmental standards is now overshadowed by questions of whether the lines between Russian private business and the Kremlin\u2019s political agenda are blurred beyond distinction.\u201cIt\u2019s all part of the same effort,\u201d said Frank Montoya Jr., a former top F.B.I. counterintelligence official. \u201cThe businesses develop relationships, and through those relationships, they try to leverage policy.\u201dFor years, European officials have been hospitable toward Russian business and Kremlin-connected investors, particularly in the energy industry. But trust has frayed. First came revelations about state-sponsored Russian hacking efforts to undermine elections in the United States and Europe. More recently, Western intelligence officials have blamed Russia for poisoning a former Russian spy on British soil.And Moscow\u2019s creation and worldwide dissemination of false stories has only sowed doubt in Europe about the statements of Russian officials and companies.\u201cThis is what Russia has created. Not every Russian company is the long arm of the Kremlin, but the suspicion is there,\u201d said Stefan Meister, a Russia specialist at the German Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin. \u201cThe Russians have done everything to create distrust in their businesses.\u201dPhosAgro, a publicly traded company, dismissed any notion of Russian government involvement in its efforts. \u201cThis is utter nonsense,\u201d the company\u2019s chairman, Sven Ombudstvedt, said in a written statement. \u201cPhosAgro is acting as any business would and should \u2014 with the potential to benefit a wide range of stakeholders, from food consumers to farmers to the company\u2019s own shareholders.\u201dLike many of the largest Russian conglomerates, PhosAgro has strong Kremlin ties. It is run by Andrei A. Guryev, the scion to one of the country\u2019s wealthiest oligarch families. Vladimir Litvinenko, a former high-ranking official for President Vladimir V. Putin\u2019s political campaigns, owns 19 percent of the company. The company obtained an important mine in 2012 after Mr. Putin\u2019s government seized it from a political opponent, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, and put it up for sale.\u201cPhosAgro and the Kremlin, through Mr. Litvinenko, are very close. It\u2019s like one family,\u201d said Igor Sychev, a former company executive now living in asylum in Latvia. \u201cThey wash each other\u2019s hands.\u201dThe debate now brewing is over whether the European Union should impose strict limits on the levels of cadmium, a toxic metal in fertilizer. By a quirk of geology, PhosAgro is sitting on a stockpile of fertilizer minerals that are naturally much lower in cadmium than its competitors.The European Union has almost no domestic supply of the phosphate rock used to make fertilizer. So it relies on imports to meet its farming needs. Morocco is the bloc\u2019s leading supplier, followed by Russia, which accounts for roughly a third of imports. PhosAgro is Russia\u2019s dominant industry player.For more than a decade, the European Union has been considering imposing cadmium limits to unify standards among member nations. Cadmium occurs naturally in phosphate rock, though levels vary depending on where it is mined.Russian fertilizers have naturally low cadmium levels, while the levels in Moroccan fertilizers are naturally higher. A strict cadmium cap could all but ban Moroccan exports to Europe and turn the market over to Russia, a European government analysis concluded.\u201cThey\u2019ll be sitting on a monopoly,\u201d said Tomasz Wlostowski, a lobbyist who represents European fertilizer manufacturers. \u201cThey will have no competition at all on the European market.\u201dBut it is the prospect of Russian agricultural influence that has ignited the greatest debate in Brussels. PhosAgro and its allies say that fears of a Russian fertilizer monopoly are overstated. They say tighter regulations, which would be phased in over years, will attract new suppliers of clean fertilizer and encourage the development of technology to remove cadmium from phosphate rock.\u201cUndoubtedly, the European population will be the main beneficiary,\u201d Mr. Ombudstvedt said. And while PhosAgro is the dominant industry advocate for the regulations, he noted that European governments began debating cadmium limits long before the company got involved.\u201cThere is no reason to panic,\u201d said Pavel Poc, a Czech member of the European Parliament. He said that science and hard data should not be overshadowed by politicians playing \u201cthe Russian card.\u201d PhosAgro agrees. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be about Russia,\u201d said Pascale Michaux, a lobbyist who represents the company. \u201cIt should be an objective discussion about public health and market access.\u201dThe science around cadmium, however, is murky. It has been linked to kidney damage and cancer, so European officials worry that adding it to the soil will increase cadmium levels in the food supply. But the relationship between cadmium in fertilizer, cadmium in soil and cadmium in the human body is far less clear. Scientists cannot say how much cadmium in fertilizer is too much.One stark example: California has the strictest cadmium cap in the United States, and it is up to 40 times as high as the levels being considered in Europe. \u201cThe uncertainty around all of this is very wide,\u201d said Erik Smolders, a soil scientist at K.U. Leuven, a university in Belgium.After that study, PhosAgro commissioned a different one, led by Paul Romkens at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, who said the limit was actually much lower, about 20 milligrams per kilogram. The wildly different figures allowed both sides of the cadmium debate to claim scientific support.Then things got heated.While the PhosAgro study was waiting to be published, Mr. Smolders and Mr. Romkens began working together to understand their competing conclusions. Out of those conversations came a new model, one endorsed by both professors. It placed the cadmium limit at 44 milligrams per kilogram, far higher than PhosAgro wanted.By then, Mr. Romkens\u2019s original paper was ready for publication, and he told PhosAgro that he intended to refer to the new findings in the paper the company had funded.\u201cThey made it clear they were not very happy,\u201d Mr. Romkens recalled. He said he told the company, \u201cWe can leave those results out if you insist, but we have to put a disclaimer on it.\u201dThe group Safer Phosphates presents itself as an alliance of environmentally conscious fertilizer companies. But essentially, Safer Phosphates is PhosAgro. Its partners are comparatively small players who have not even registered to lobby on the cadmium regulation. Asked about the issue recently, one company referred a reporter to PhosAgro\u2019s spokesman, who also speaks for Safer Phosphates.Europe\u2019s governing bodies remain divided on a cadmium limit, and how quickly it would be enacted. Any new regulation would need the approval of the nationally elected leaders who make up the European Council, who have expressed resistance to levels that might cut off Moroccan imports.\u201cIt\u2019s a different perception of Russia now,\u201d said Mr. Meister, the Russia scholar. \u201cThere\u2019s always a suspicion that there\u2019s something else behind the scenes.\u201dA previous version of this article incorrectly rendered the academic affiliation of Erik Smolders, a soil scientist. He is affiliated with K.U. Leuven, not Catholic University of Leuven. The university now identifies itself as K.U. Leuven and no longer uses Catholic University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sidney Shachnow, 83, Is Dead; Holocaust Escapee and U.S. General", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMaj. Gen. Sidney Shachnow, who escaped a Nazi labor camp in Lithuania as a boy and later rose through the ranks of the United States Army, eventually leading its forces in Berlin at the end of the Cold War, died on Sept. 27 in Pinehurst, N.C. He was 83.His daughter LeeAnne Keister confirmed the death, at a hospital near his horse farm in Southern Pines, N.C. He had Parkinson\u2019s disease, atrial fibrillation and polycythemia vera, a blood cancer, she said.His path to becoming a major general began in Kaunas, also known as Kovno, a major city in south-central Lithuania, where he was born Schaja Shachnowski on Nov. 23, 1934, to Leon and Rose (Schuster) Shachnowski. His father was an engineer; his mother, a homemaker and seamstress.The ghetto was a de facto concentration camp, General Shachnow recalled many years later. Though it had no gas chambers or crematories, he said, nearly everybody there died.After three years of escalating brutality (in one instance a guard beat him with a shovel), his family devised an improbable but successful escape plan for him. Leaving behind his weeping parents one morning before dawn, 9-year-old Schaja hid under his Uncle Willie\u2019s long coat as the uncle, with Schaja moving in rhythm with him, walked through the gates, passing guards and a work detail that was often sent outside the ghetto. Shortly afterward, children at the camp were liquidated.When he and his uncle reached the streets beyond the gates of the ghetto, he said, his uncle gave him a prearranged signal to emerge from under the coat and find his contact, a woman wearing a red kerchief. Following the route he had been given, Schaja found her and followed her to temporary safety \u2014 in a storage room of a building with a table, chairs and a toilet.She locked the door, and he wondered, he later recalled, if he had traded one imprisonment for another.\u201cI had escaped from hell!\u201d General Shachnow wrote in his autobiography, \u201cHope and Honor\u201d (2004), written with Jan Robbins. \u201cOr had I?\u201dAfterward he was taken in by a Roman Catholic family and lived with them for several months. He was then reunited with his mother, who had escaped from the camp, and his younger brother, Mula, who had been smuggled to safety disguised as a girl. For a while they lived in the family\u2019s house in Kaunas with Soviet officers; the Red Army had by then taken control of Lithuania.But fearing that the Communists would seal the country\u2019s borders after the war, Schaja left with his mother and brother on a 2,000-mile trek by foot, wagon and train through Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary before settling in Furth, Germany, near Nuremberg, in the fall of 1945. His father, who had been fighting the Germans with partisans, rejoined them, and they charted a path to the United States.In 1950 the family left Germany on a Navy transport ship and arrived in Boston. Schaja, his parents and brother settled in Salem, Mass., where relatives had preceded them to America. As they sought to assimilate \u2014 he did not speak English at first \u2014 Schaja became known as Sidney and his brother as Stanley.Sidney attended high school but dropped out in 1955 and joined the Army. He married Arlene Armstrong \u2014 a Jewish-Catholic union that his parents opposed.\u201cJoin the new world,\u201d he recalled telling his parents. \u201cAmerica, the melting pot. Have you even taken a step into this world? You both live in the past!\u201dStarting as an infantry private, he rose to captain in the Special Forces, or Green Berets, in 1962 and fought in Vietnam, twice receiving the Silver Star for valor.Transferred to West Berlin in 1970, he was given command of Detachment (A), an elite Special Forces unit that conducted clandestine intelligence missions in Eastern Europe. He led it for four years.After other postings, including as director of the United States Special Operations Command in Washington, he returned to West Berlin as the Army\u2019s commanding officer in 1989, when events were unfolding that would lead to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the reunification of Germany.As a German-speaking combat veteran, General Shachnow was well suited to serve in Berlin. But as a Holocaust survivor, he was confronted with what he felt was delicious irony: His headquarters had been those of the powerful Nazi official Hermann G\u00f6ring, and his residence had once belonged to Fritz Reinhardt, a finance minister under Hitler.After leaving Berlin, he was appointed commander of the Special Forces and commanding general of the John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School at Fort Bragg, N.C. While in the service he received a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Nebraska and a master\u2019s degree in public administration from Shippensburg State College (now Shippensburg University) in Pennsylvania.He retired from the Army in 1994.In addition to his wife and his daughter LeeAnne, he is survived by three other daughters, Sheree Gillette, Michelle Batiste and Denise Smith; 14 grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren; and his brother.General Shachnow said that flexibility, tenacity and assertiveness were among the qualities that had helped him survive the Holocaust.\u201cUnavoidable suffering can give you meaning in life,\u201d he said in the Elon University speech. \u201cFor me, my military experience, my experience in a concentration camp and my relationship with my wife gave me meaning.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misstated the surname of one of General Shachnow\u2019s daughters.

{"Headline": "U.S. Campaign Against Migration Goes Unheard, or Unheeded, in Guatemala", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "More migrants from Guatemala than from anywhere else are trying to cross the border into the United States, despite warnings about the perils of the journey north.Supported byCONCEPCI\u00d3N CHIQUIRICHAPA, Guatemala \u2014 Six months ago, Liset Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s husband packed a small bag, hugged their three children and said goodbye as he left on the more than 1,200-mile trip to the United States. It was his sixth attempt to try to cross the border illegally to find work.The couple had borrowed the equivalent of nearly $13,000 from a friend to pay a smuggler for the trip. Ms. Ju\u00e1rez said her husband was aware of the dangers \u2014 unscrupulous smugglers, dangerous desert crossings and possible kidnapping by deadly Mexican drug cartels \u2014 but felt he had few alternatives in Guatemala, where he was deep in debt after his business failed.\u201cWhat can we do?\u201d Ms. Ju\u00e1rez said two weeks ago, speaking through a translator. \u201cWe have to feed our children.\u201d She declined to identify her husband by name, for fear he would be arrested in the United States by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.Ms. Ju\u00e1rez\u2019s husband was among the thousands of Guatemalans who have ignored a messaging campaign of billboards and radio and TV ads by the American and Guatemalan governments that warn against the dangerous journey to the United States.Over the past year, 42,757 Guatemalans traveling as families were either apprehended or otherwise stopped at the United States border with Mexico, according to Customs and Border Protection data. They accounted for nearly half of all migrants who sought to enter the United States with their relatives.And the numbers have been on the rise. Two years ago, just under one-third of families stopped at the border were Guatemalan.Interviews with dozens of people in Concepci\u00f3n Chiquirichapa, a town of nearly 10,000 residents with a vibrant public market, revealed that almost everyone has family \u2014 or knows someone with family \u2014 in the United States.The reason for the diaspora is simple, residents said: extreme poverty.About 76 percent of the population in Guatemala\u2019s western highlands is impoverished, and 67 percent of children younger than 5 suffer from chronic malnutrition, according to the United States Agency for International Development.Over one million Guatemalans in the region\u2019s rural areas lack electricity. Many earn little to no profit from the coffee, corn, beans and other agricultural products they grow, given the steadily declining price of farm goods. Coffee production alone has dropped 6 percent since last year, according to the Department of Agriculture, and small farmers are unable to cover their costs.Additionally, residents cited drug trafficking, widespread corruption in the local government and extortion by gangs as contributing to their decision to leave cities and towns in the western highlands.\u201cWe have to create better opportunities for people so they can stay home,\u201d said V\u00edctor Manuel Asturias Cord\u00f3n, who heads the National Competitiveness Program, or Pronacom, a Guatemalan government agency that promotes economic development.\u201cWe also have to work on countering smugglers who have convinced people that their best opportunities to be successful lie in the states,\u201d he said.Alarmed by the influx of thousands of Guatemalans at the border, American officials have begun to search for more effective ways to stem the flow of the migrants.In late September, Kevin K. McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, traveled to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador \u2014 the three countries that make up the bulk of the migrants apprehended at the southwestern border. In Guatemala, he met with government officials and leaders of business and indigenous communities.He said law enforcement alone could not stop the migration of tens of thousands of Guatemalans attempting to illegally enter the United States.\u201cI\u2019m here to listen and learn the issues you are facing so we can work together,\u201d he told a group of Guatemalan officials at a center where migrants return after being deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.Mr. McAleenan also toured several projects funded by the Agency for International Development, including a coffee processing facility in Guatemala City and a farm in Quetzaltenango, the largest city in the western highlands, where new variants of corn and other vegetables are being produced.Meeting with several indigenous leaders at a round table in Quetzaltenango, Mr. McAleenan said he understood that most people leaving the region were trying to find work.But he reminded them that illegally crossing the American border is a crime, and warned of smugglers who have misled desperate migrants by assuring them that they can remain in the United States if they arrive as families.\u201cThere is no ability to stay in the United States if you bring a child, and there is no ability to stay if you are pregnant,\u201d Mr. McAleenan said. \u201cWe need to continue to provide accurate information so they won\u2019t make this dangerous journey, where they face physical and sexual assault.\u201dBut the lure of a better life in America remains strong for many Guatemalans.In the town of Cajol\u00e1, a 20-year-old woman who identified herself only as Onelia said she had attempted to illegally cross the border into Texas at least three times \u2014 twice in Laredo and once in McAllen \u2014 before being deported back to Guatemala.Onelia works at the Asociaci\u00f3n Grupo Cajol\u00e1, an organization set up by a former migrant named Eduardo Jim\u00e9nez to keep local residents in Guatemala by providing them with jobs. Since July, Onelia has processed honey at the organization; other women make indigenous clothing to sell.There is a day care in the basement for children whose mothers are working upstairs. Their fathers have mostly migrated to the United States.Onelia said she enjoyed her work, and earned a decent salary. But in November, she said, she plans to again set off for the United States.\u201cWe know about the risk and we know how hard it is,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we still want to go.\u201dThe messaging campaign, however, has largely gone unnoticed.Nine billboards in Guatemala\u2019s western highlands area, paid for by the American government, warn potential migrants about the dangers of the trip north. Officials said they have also placed advertisements on radio and television with additional warnings, at a total cost of about $750,000.Across Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the American government is spending about $1.3 million on the campaign.But interviews with more than a dozen people in the Guatemalan highlands\u2019 largest city and several small towns showed that few residents have seen or heard the warnings. Many of the people interviewed said they would not be persuaded to stay anyway.A parallel, and far more powerful, messaging campaign by smugglers is resonating by word of mouth.Residents said they see daily advertisements by the smugglers, or coyotes, promising to get them to the United States. On at least one community radio station in Quetzaltenango, smugglers regularly offer to transport and help finance northbound travels for migrants.Smugglers are also active on social media. Some have promoted their services on Facebook, offering to take migrants anywhere in the \u201cAmerican union.\u201dMost of the advertisements are couched in language similar to that of a travel agent. Migrants are offered different types of trips, based on how much they can pay. And many are guaranteed three chances to cross the border for the cost of their trip.The ads feature pictures of charter buses, offering an image of a trip that is far different from what most migrants will experience as they make the journey on crowded buses and on foot from Guatemala to the border between Mexico and the United States.At the urging of American officials, the Guatemalan government has begun offering rewards to people who turn in smugglers. But getting people to do so has been a struggle.\u201cNo one will turn them in, because within the community they are not seen as bad people,\u201d said Dora Alonzo, 27, who runs an organization in Quetzaltenango to keep children from trying to migrate to America. \u201cBut everyone knows who they are.\u201dMs. Alonzo said her father and a sister migrated to the United States with help from smugglers. Her father returned to Guatemala eight years ago, after spending seven years in the United States. Her sister lives in South Carolina, she said.She would not name the smugglers. But she said the American government\u2019s plea for Guatemalans to remain at home is unlikely to be effective. The promise of a good life in the United States, she said, overrides the risk of the trip.\u201cThat is the way to have a house and a car,\u201d she said.Mr. McAleenan, the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, said it was too early to judge whether the new messaging campaign \u2014 in Spanish and indigenous languages \u2014 had worked.\u201cWe have to give it some time to see whether it\u2019s effective in reaching that audience and creating that deterrence,\u201d he said.Back in Concepci\u00f3n Chiquirichapa, Liset Ju\u00e1rez said her husband finally made it to the United States after nearly a half-dozen tries.He plans to stay three years. With the money he makes as a laborer, she said they plan to pay back their debt, and save up to open another business.Asked if she plans to join her husband in the United States, she shook her head no.\u201cI can\u2019t abandon my children,\u201d she said. \u201cI have three children I have to sustain here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

One River Point\u2019s rotating exhibition program will include shows conceived in collaboration with artists, guest curators and Miami arts institutions.Further afield, artists are also working with developers, even in places that are only just beginning to see the value in real estate and art partnerships. Cidade Matarazzo, a residential development in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, is built around a \u201chouse of creativity,\u201d a dedicated space for artists in residence. \u201cI don\u2019t think museums are the exclusive way to distill the message of the prophets of modern times,\u201d the developer, Alexandre Allard, said of prominent artists today. \u201cThere is not much art in the street in Brazil. But I believe in the extraordinary potential of my country to convey messages about religion, community, race and ethnicity through art.\u201dMr. Allard hopes that 30 million people will visit his complex, which includes a hotel, and residential and commercial structures, each year and walk away astonished. \u201cI believe Matarazzo is the model of the sustainable museum of the future,\u201d he said.Ultimately, Ms. Samuels said, galleries are still a place of prestige, but \u201ceveryone is craving a new way to create a dialogue and to be a part of culture.\u201d She said she thought of this as a new way to construct the perfect triumvirate. \u201cA smart developer hires a great architect, who needs a great interior designer, who needs a great artist,\u201d she explained. \u201cTaken together, you can bring out the best gestalt of a space.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified the artist whose work will be featured at a condominium opening next year in Miami. The artist is Robert Indiana, not Gary Indiana.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "How Jared Kushner Avoided Paying Taxes", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser appears to have paid almost no federal income taxes for several years running.Here\u2019s an example of how he did it: Kushner Companies buys a property. The majority of the money for the purchase comes in the form of mortgages and personal loans from banks.Under the federal tax code, real estate investors can write off the purchase price of the building \u2014 excluding the cost of the land \u2014 over a period of decades. Although Kushner Companies has spent little or no cash of its own, the firm takes large annual deductions based on the theoretical depreciation of the building. The property generates cash for the Kushners. But any earnings, which would be subject to the federal income tax, are swamped by the amount that the company is taking in write-offs for depreciation. The result is that Kushner Companies records a net loss for tax purposes.The company passes on that loss to its owners, including Mr. Kushner and his father, Charles.The loss can be used to offset the Kushners\u2019 income in the year it is recorded, and it can be carried forward to cancel out future income or to get refunds for taxes they paid in previous years. When Kushner Companies sells a property, it can use the proceeds to finance a new acquisition. If done within the right time frame, the company can indefinitely defer any capital-gains taxes it might owe on the sale of the original property. The outcome is apparent in Jared Kushner\u2019s tax returns, which were summarized in the documents reviewed by The New York Times. Here\u2019s an example from 2015.IncomeW-2 income: $198,000.Taxable interest: $536,000.Dividends: $1,000.Capital gains: $974,000.DeductionsTax losses from real estate and other partnerships: $3.5 million.Tax losses carried forward from previous years: $4.8 million.Total adjusted gross incomeNegative $6.6 million.Tax refund$4,000.Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Mr. Kushner\u2019s lawyer, Abbe Lowell, said he would not respond to assumptions derived from documents that provide an incomplete picture and were \u201cobtained in violation of the law and standard business confidentiality agreements.\u201d\u201cHowever,\u201d he continued, \u201calways following the advice of numerous attorneys and accountants, Mr. Kushner properly filed and paid all taxes due under the law and regulations.\u201d The documents that The Times reviewed were created, with Mr. Kushner\u2019s cooperation, as part of a review of his finances by an institution that was considering lending him money. Totaling more than 40 pages, they describe his business dealings, earnings, expenses and borrowing from 2009 to 2016. They contain information that was taken from Mr. Kushner\u2019s federal tax filings, as well as other data provided by his advisers.

{"Headline": "U.C.F. Is the Best College Football Team in Florida. So, Where\u2019s the Respect?", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Josh Heupel, the head football coach at the University of Central Florida, was on a recruiting trip several months ago when his wife called and asked when his next flight was.There was no flight. He was simply driving to Jacksonville, a couple of hours from Central Florida\u2019s Orlando campus.\u201cLast year during recruiting, I got on maybe four flights total,\u201d said Heupel, who put in years as a recruiting road warrior when he was an assistant at Oklahoma and Missouri.Still, undefeated U.C.F. is probably the fourth- or fifth-best-known team in the state, a directional university celebrating its 50th anniversary, whose football program has played in college sports\u2019 top tier for barely two decades. Its league, the American Athletic Conference, distributes to its members a small fraction of the windfall from media deals compared with what the biggest conferences deliver to their schools.Three years ago, U.C.F. went 0-12. Yet the No. 10 Knights are, for a second year in a row, the best team in the state and one of the best anywhere else. In the last five years, they have won two New Year\u2019s Day bowl games. They hold the longest active winning streak in the Football Bowl Subdivision, at 19 games.This year the offense is ranked third in Division I in yards and seventh in points per game. It is worth noting that a game at North Carolina was called off after Hurricane Florence, and the Knights have trounced mostly weak competition (including one Power 5 team, Pitt) and barely survived Memphis last weekend.\u201cI often say that reputation lags reality,\u201d said Dale Whittaker, the U.C.F. president. He was referring to the university as a whole, but it might apply to the football team especially.Originally Florida Technological University, and founded several miles east of downtown Orlando in connection with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \u2014 Cape Canaveral is less than an hour\u2019s drive to the east \u2014 U.C.F. has grown into one of the country\u2019s largest universities, with 68,000 students. Whittaker compares U.C.F. to Ohio State and Arizona State as a giant, urban university well suited to the 21st century\u2019s information economy.As for football, \u201cOur competitive advantages are very real,\u201d said Danny White, the university\u2019s athletic director.\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to be here?\u201d said Richie Grant, a defensive back from Fort Walton Beach, Fla. \u201cLike, it\u2019s supposed to be fall, winter, something like that? And it\u2019s, what, 90 degrees out here?\u201dFlorida being Florida, there will always be a surplus of talent.\u201cThey may not be big enough for Florida or Miami to go after them, but they\u2019re still going to be fast or strong,\u201d said Luke Stampini, a recruiting analyst for 247Sports who is based in Delray Beach, Fla.These athletes, then \u2014 rawly gifted, but not as purely talented as those who end up at the in-state blue bloods \u2014 may need specific schemes built around them, but White conceived the potential for a \u201cmoneyball\u201d-esque strategy as he watched Baylor and Texas Christian routinely defeat Texas and Texas A&M during the past decade with innovative game plans.When he arrived in late 2015, White sought a coach who would install a quick tempo to complement the athletes\u2019 physical speed. He got Scott Frost, who had been an assistant at Oregon under Chip Kelly, known for his creativity and fast pace.At Oregon, Frost had tutored Marcus Mariota, who won the Heisman Trophy after his final year with the Ducks and went on to become the Tennessee Titans\u2019 starting quarterback. Mariota is revered in his native state, Hawaii, and so McKenzie Milton, a talented Class of 2016 quarterback from Mililani High School in Hawaii, was receptive to Frost\u2019s entreaties. But Oregon never offered Milton a scholarship.\u201cHe\u2019s small,\u201d Stampini said of Milton. \u201cIf he was 6-2, the whole Pac-12 would have been after him.\u201dWhen Frost took the U.C.F. job, Milton flipped his commitment from Hawaii. Last season, he threw for more than 4,000 yards, with 37 touchdowns against nine interceptions, adding 613 yards and eight touchdowns on the ground.Heupel hired Randy Shannon, a former player and longtime assistant at Miami and then Florida with vital in-state ties, as his defensive coordinator. He got recruits on the phone the night of their first news conference, Heupel said.With 68,000 students, the university is set to collect roughly $25 million in fees this year.U.C.F.\u2019s two final games in the regular season are against No. 20 Cincinnati and then down Interstate 4 at South Florida, currently ranked 21st. Win out, and U.C.F. will get a conference championship game against strong competition, but will it be strong enough to impress the playoff committee?Snubbing U.C.F. last year, the playoff committee argued that \u201cthey had not been as challenged with their nonconference schedule, and their schedule over all, as teams right above them and right below them,\u201d in the words of Kirby Hocutt, the committee chairman, who is Texas Tech\u2019s athletic director.White felt that was disrespectful not only to U.C.F. but to its league, which counted two other teams in the final A.P. rankings. This past weekend, undefeated Notre Dame moved up a spot in the A.P. poll, to No. 4, after barely beating Pitt \u2014 the same squad U.C.F. torched by 31 points a few weeks before. A.A.C. teams, from top to bottom, are 7-8 versus Power 5 teams this year.Two years ago, U.C.F. was one of several finalists for spots in the Big 12 before that conference elected not to expand. The next expansion era most likely will not occur until the middle of the next decade, when several broadcast deals are set to expire. The A.A.C. is preparing to negotiate a new deal now. Its agreement with ESPN expires in 2020.White said the A.A.C. merits inclusion in a \u201cPower 6\u201d setup for the F.B.S. For now, though, the Knights must win all their games and hope a payoff will come.\u201cPeople are going to look at this conference, look who we played, crossover games, look at scores,\u201d Heupel said, \u201cand I think we\u2019ll be where we want to be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "William Wheeler, New York Mass Transit Visionary, Dies at 69", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWilliam M. Wheeler, who as a New York mass transit official oversaw the strategic planning that inaugurated the MetroCard, belatedly spawned the first phase of the Second Avenue subway and dared, by recommending countdown clocks, to introduce the presumption that subways and buses would arrive punctually, died on Saturday at his home in Tarrytown, N.Y. He was 69.The cause was coronary artery disease, which had previously been undetected, his son, William Wheeler III, saidAs the Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s deputy director of strategic planning from 1986 to 1992, director of planning and development for the next decade and, since 2002, director of special project development and planning, Mr. Wheeler did not have much of a public profile, but he was persuasive within the agency and before its board.Long before sandhogs bored the tunnels he conceived or highway workers installed barriers to unclog the bus lanes he championed, Mr. Wheeler assembled the statistical nuts and bolts needed to assess the region\u2019s future transportation needs.\u201cSince starting with the M.T.A. in 1986, Bill has been integral to the success of every aspect of change in mass transit in the New York metropolitan area,\u201d Joseph J. Lhota, the authority\u2019s chairman, said in an email.Mr. Lhota credited Mr. Wheeler with, among other things, helping to develop the MetroCard and its projected successor payment system, the elimination of two-fare subway zones and helping to secure federal financing for the Fulton Transit Center in Lower Manhattan.He also assisted with plans to sell developers the rights to build over the Atlantic and Hudson train yards, to resume the long-delayed construction of the Second Avenue subway, and to extend the Flushing line, which stops at the stadiums where Mets games and United States Open tennis matches are held, to the West Side of Manhattan.While some of his colleagues worried about a signal outage or moving a stalled train during the morning rush hour, Mr. Wheeler was figuring out how much New York\u2019s population would grow in the next 20 years, where those people would live and work, how and when they would get there, and what it would take for the M.T.A. to meet the projected demand.A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2018\u201cHe understood that the M.T.A.\u2019s mass transit and commuter rail systems had to adapt to new patterns of work and housing,\u201d Prof. Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University, said in an email.While focusing on long-range projects like the Long Island Rail Road\u2019s access to the East Side of Manhattan, Mr. Wheeler also advocated quick fixes to squeeze more capacity from the region\u2019s current resources. These included upgrading signals, speeding bus service, adding more subway transfer points and, to speed boarding, more subway entrances, and posting waiting times for subways and buses to enable passengers to make travel decisions on the spot.\u201cPeople want things done in their commuting lifetime; we can\u2019t simply identify corridors or new subway lines and expect that will solve a problem,\u201d he told Progressive Railroading magazine in 2013. \u201cWe need to be more surgical with our existing network.\u201dHis forecasts were usually correct \u2014 even if the board members he reported to did not always follow his advice, and even if the city and state officials who had appointed the board failed to finance his recommendations.Mr. Wheeler embraced farsighted solutions, among them linking transportation planning to retail, office and residential development, and requiring the owners of property adjacent to new subway lines to pay for improvements. He questioned whether subsidizing most ferries was worth the cost, considering the number of passengers they carried.But he acknowledged that transportation planning was often determined by political expediency as much as by the practicalities of moving people from one place to another. As an example, Mr. Wheeler cited the difficulty of reallocating city streets for bus lanes or other purposes.William Moyer Wheeler Jr. was born on Sept. 24, 1949, in Braintree, Mass. His father was an engineer for a manufacturing company. His mother, Betty Jane Reid, was a teacher.After graduating from Haddon Heights High School in New Jersey, he received a bachelor\u2019s degree in political science from Marietta College in Ohio, a master\u2019s in public administration specializing in urban affairs from American University in Washington, and a master of science degree from Manhattan College School of Engineering in the Bronx.Before joining the M.T.A., he was a transportation planner for the City of Yonkers and director of planning for the Westchester transportation department. Since 1983, he had also directed the central staff of the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council.In 1972, he married Diane Grisanti. She died in 2013. In addition to his son, he is survived by his daughter, Joanna Marie Wheeler; his mother; a brother, Jon Wheeler; and a sister, Wendy Wheeler.Advertisement"}

Several accusations of sexual misconduct were made against Leslie Moonves, its chief executive, as well against a longtime leader of its news division. Separately, a contentious legal showdown with its controlling shareholder threatened to upend the company\u2019s management.Several years ago, Mr. Parsons was found to have a rare form of blood cancer known as multiple myeloma. His disease went into remission after he underwent a stem cell transplant. In a statement released by CBS, he said, \u201cUnfortunately, unanticipated complications have created additional new challenges, and my doctors have advised that cutting back on my current commitments is essential to my overall recovery.\u201dUnder Mr. Parsons\u2019s leadership, the revamped CBS board had already started the search for a chief executive as it evaluated who could best help the company navigate what has become a tough landscape for media businesses. Silicon Valley continues to steal ad dollars and eyeballs away from traditional television outlets, and entertainment companies have had to find new ways to maintain relevance with younger audiences.In the case of CBS, it has played up gains in its streaming effort, CBS All Access, which has over 2.5 million paying subscribers and is on pace to hit four million by next year, according to the company. The premium cable network Showtime, part of CBS, has also made strides in streaming and expects to sign up a similar number of customers in the same period. Together, the streaming businesses account for over $500 million in annual revenue, a business line that didn\u2019t exist just years ago.Mr. Ianniello, who is a candidate to become the permanent chief executive, has already made several key executive appointments in the two months he has been on the job.The CBS board hired Nancy Kestenbaum of Covington & Burling and Mary Jo White of Debevoise & Plimpton to conduct its internal investigation into the accusations and the overall culture at the company.Ms. White led the Securities and Exchange Commission during the Obama administration and was previously the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. Ms. Kestenbaum was also a federal prosecutor with the same district. The results of the investigation are expected by the end of the year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade War May Create New Auto Jobs. In China.", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump has said he started a trade war to create jobs in America. But foreign carmakers that employ thousands of workers in the United States are gauging whether tariffs, the main weapon in that war, may compel them to shift jobs to, of all places, China.Carmakers\u2019 early hopes that congressional Republicans who favor free trade could restrain Mr. Trump have faded. Instead, manufacturers are girding for a protracted period of conflict that will disrupt supply chains and change the companies\u2019 calculations about where to expand and where to cut back.BMW, the largest exporter of cars from the United States, has already moved some production of its popular X3 sport utility vehicle \u2014 once made exclusively in Spartanburg, S.C. \u2014 to a factory in Shenyang, China. Analysts expect the German automaker to also move some production of its larger X5.By shifting production, BMW can avoid China\u2019s punitive tariffs on cars imported from the United States, which have ensnared foreign automakers with large American factories. It could also insulate BMW if Mr. Trump follows through on his threat to tax imported vehicles and parts, a move that would further increase the cost of building cars in the United States and selling them abroad.The Chinese government is encouraging expansion. It is allowing BMW to increase its stake in a Chinese joint venture to 75 percent from 50 percent, an unprecedented majority share for a foreign carmaker that makes BMW the first company to benefit from a policy meant to give the makers of passenger cars larger stakes in such joint ventures.Business leaders in South Carolina and other areas that depend on foreign carmakers are registering alarm. At the very least, they wonder if jobs to be created for future models will shift out of the United States. Their worst fear? Workers in places like Spartanburg could see jobs wither.\u201cIt\u2019s not just BMW,\u201d Mr. Britt said by telephone from Spartanburg. \u201cIt\u2019s every one of the suppliers that produce for BMW.\u201dThe effects of the trade war are already being felt in South Carolina.China is a big and profitable market for BMW. But retaliatory tariffs of 40 percent on imported cars have sharply raised the cost of X5s in China. The company was able to skirt some of the tariffs by meeting some of the demand in China with cars partly built in South Carolina and finished in Thailand.BMW is stepping up its investments in China. It has announced that it would spend $3.4 billion to expand its Shenyang operations and hire 5,000 workers over the next several years. The two factories it operates there could eventually surpass Spartanburg, BMW\u2019s largest factory in the world, in the number of cars produced.BMW representatives emphasize that the company has not decided to relocate production of the X5, one of its most profitable models, from Spartanburg. But Saskia Essbauer, a spokeswoman, said: \u201cProduction always follows the market. Naturally as a company we have an interest to produce where the demand is.\u201dOthers are following BMW\u2019s lead. ZF, a major German auto industry supplier, recently said that it would build a factory in China to produce transmissions used in the X5 and other BMW models.\u201cOur philosophy is we follow our customers and we serve our customers where they need us,\u201d said Christoph Horn, a ZF spokesman.Other foreign car companies will have to make similar assessments. Mercedes-Benz employs about 4,000 workers at a large factory in Alabama. The Swedish carmaker Volvo, which belongs to Zhejiang Geely Holdings of China, opened a plant in South Carolina in June. Volvo plans to hire 1,500 people in the state.Daimler, which exports Mercedes cars to China from a factory in Tuscaloosa, Ala., has warned that trade tensions were hurting its sales. In a call with reporters on Thursday, Bodo Uebber, the chief financial officer, said the company was reviewing ways to counter the effect of the tariffs, which have meant higher prices for clients and dealers.Mr. Uebber said that Daimler was \u201ccurrently delivering normally into China.\u201d Asked about possible changes in the production line, he said, \u201cWe are looking at other alternatives, but it is too early to say anything.\u201dStefan Elfstrom, a Volvo spokesman, did not dispute the comments attributed to Mr. Gustafsson, but he said the company\u2019s plans for South Carolina had not changed.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies could lead to more auto industry jobs in the United States, but at a stiff price to consumers.Newly revised trade agreements with Mexico and Canada require carmakers to use more components made in the United States. Suppliers may expand American operations to comply, but they will be forced to pass the extra cost on to customers.Higher prices, at a time when interest rates on auto loans are also rising, could crimp demand and offset any job gains.\u201cThe average price of a vehicle in the United States is $35,000,\u201d said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of government affairs at the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents suppliers. \u201cIf we increase the cost without increasing the value, are we going to be able to sell those vehicles? It\u2019s going to be a real challenge.\u201dFor automakers and suppliers, figuring out where and how much to invest has become devilishly difficult because no one knows what Mr. Trump is going to do. Many are delaying decisions as long as they can.\u201cA lot of my clients are in wait-and-see mode,\u201d said Mike Wall, director of automotive analysis at IHS Markit, a research firm. \u201cBefore they commit on a new facility or a new technology, they want to make sure they\u2019re not going be turned upside down because of tariffs.\u201dThe irony is that the turmoil is being felt most keenly in the Southeastern states where BMW and Mercedes as well as hundreds of suppliers are, hard-core Trump country.Mr. Britt, the Spartanburg County Council member, said he was a lifelong Republican who, like many Spartanburg residents, voted for Mr. Trump. But he has become a vocal opponent of the president\u2019s trade policies, and he questions how long Mr. Trump\u2019s support will hold.\u201cPeople vote with their pocketbooks,\u201d Mr. Britt said. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting South Carolina would go Democrat, but when people start losing jobs, a lot can happen.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified one of the countries that is a party to newly revised trade agreements that require carmakers to use more components made in the United States.

{"Headline": "Netflix Keeps Adding Subscribers, and Market Investors Could Profit", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by__________More people sitting around watching Netflix may help rekindle some animal spirits in the stock market.The company on Tuesday reported that many more people signed up for its video-streaming service in the third quarter than expected. Netflix\u2019s shares soared as much as 13 percent in the trading that takes place after regular market hours.After the stock market suffered a steep swoon this month, results like that should help stocks recover. Netflix\u2019s report was the first from one of the big technology companies that helped drive the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to a record last month.Investors have charted the performance of these tech stocks by bunching them into a group they call FAANG, which includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Their contribution to the overall market has been significant. In the 12 months through Monday, the S. & P. 500 had risen 7.7 percent, but without the five technology stocks its performance was only 5.2 percent, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse.Netflix is the priciest of the five prominent technology companies. This makes it a good barometer for the amount of bullishness in the stock market. If the stock keeps rising over the coming weeks, it will underscore that investors still have a strong appetite for riskier companies, an attitude that might spill over into other technology firms.As Netflix\u2019s third-quarter results showed, it is doing well in some respects. It added seven million subscribers in the period, a larger amount than it added in the third quarter of last year. But the company is also consuming large sums of cash to finance its growth and borrowing more to cover its shortfall. Netflix also faces serious competitive threats, like Disney\u2019s plan to set up its own subscription video service.Yet an important stock market yardstick \u2014 the price-earnings ratio \u2014 suggests investors have an almost unquestioning faith in Netflix\u2019s ability to notch fast-growing earnings. This ratio compares its stock price with its earnings. Take a company with a stock trading at $100. If investors expect it to make $10 per share (its net income divided by the number of shares it has issued), it would have a price-earnings ratio of 10.The ratio for the companies in the S. & P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.Of course, it\u2019s still early in the earnings reporting season \u2014 and jarring disappointments may occur. Facebook is facing mounting regulatory scrutiny and is spending large sums on making its network more secure. Apple is trying to increase its revenue in part by selling higher-priced phones that may turn off some consumers.Outside of the technology space, investors are concerned that President Trump\u2019s trade wars may hurt the earnings of large manufacturing companies.But after stocks had a wobbly start to October, strong earnings have already helped reassure investors.

{"Headline": "Are the Danes Melancholy? Are the Swedes Sad?", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe truth about the Nordic economies.Opinion ColumnistBut is a negative assessment of the Nordic economies really right? That\u2019s not at all clear. That lower G.D.P. number conceals two important points. First, by any measure people in the lower part of the income distribution are much better off in Nordic societies than their U.S. counterparts. That is, there is a lot less misery in Scandinavia \u2014 and because everyone has some chance of falling into low income, this reduces the risk of misery for a much larger share of the population.So I thought it might be useful to put together some information on how the Nordic economies actually compare to the U.S.First of all, the Nordics really have made drastically different choices in public policy. They aren\u2019t \u201csocialist,\u201d if that means government control of the means of production. They are, however, quite strongly social-democratic: as Exhibit 1 shows, they have high taxes, which finance much more generous social benefits than we have here. They also have policies on wages, working hours, and more that tilt the balance toward workers in a number of dimensions.But this understates the case, because these data don\u2019t include \u201cin kind\u201d benefits like health care and education. All of the Nordic countries have universal health care \u2014 not just single-payer, but for the most part direct government provision (a.k.a. \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d) This compares with the U.S. where \u2014 especially before the Affordable Care Act went into effect \u2014 lack of health insurance was common even for families near median income, and high deductibles are an obstacle to care even for many of the insured.Nordic education also lacks the glaring inequality in quality all too characteristic of the U.S. system.Once you take these benefits into account, it\u2019s likely that at least half the Nordic population are better off materially than their U.S. counterparts. But what about the upper half?As the CEA notes, real G.D.P. per capita is lower in the Nordics than in the U.S., and that\u2019s reflected in those lower incomes for the upper half of the income distribution. But it\u2019s worth looking at why G.D.P. is lower.Once you take vacations into account, Denmark and Sweden basically look comparable in performance to the U.S. Finland looks worse, but this is something of a special case: the Finnish economy has been ailing for a number of years, not because of socialism, but because its two premier exports \u2014 Nokia and wood pulp \u2014 were hit hard by technological change, and membership in the euro has made adjustment difficult.The point for welfare comparisons is that while Nordic families at, say, the 60th percentile of the income distribution have lower purchasing power than their American counterparts, they also have much more free time and an arguably better work-life balance. Are they really worse off? You can make a good case that taking all of this into account, the majority of Nordic citizens are actually better off than Americans.The bottom line is that real G.D.P. per capita isn\u2019t everything, and you shouldn\u2019t uncritically use that measure to judge how social democracy is working in Scandinavia.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Is Behavioral Economics So Popular?", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe recent vogue for this academic field is in part a triumph of marketing.Dr. Gal is a professor of marketing.Behavioral economics seems to have captured the popular imagination. Authors like Michael Lewis write about it in best sellers like \u201cThe Undoing Project,\u201d while pioneers of the field like Daniel Kahneman popularize it in books like \u201cThinking, Fast and Slow.\u201d Its lexicon of \u201cnudging,\u201d \u201cframing bias\u201d and \u201cthe endowment effect\u201d has become part of the vernacular of business, finance and policymaking.

The field has been described by Richard Thaler, one of its founders, as \u201ceconomics done with strong injections of good psychology.\u201d Proponents view it as a way to make economics more accurate by incorporating more realistic assumptions about how humans behave.The popularity of such low-cost psychological interventions, or \u201cnudges,\u201d under the label of behavioral economics is in part a triumph of marketing. It reflects the widespread perception that behavioral economics combines the cleverness and fun of pop psychology with the rigor and relevance of economics.But Dr. Rucker and I note that there is an alternative explanation: The participants may not have had a clearly defined idea of what the mug was worth to them. If that was the case, there was a range of prices for the mug ($4 to $6) that left the participants disinclined to either buy or sell it, and therefore mug owners and non-owners maintained the status quo out of inertia. Only a relatively high price ($7 and up) offered a meaningful incentive for an owner to bother parting with the mug; correspondingly, only a relatively low price ($3 or below) offered a meaningful incentive for a non-owner to bother acquiring the mug.There is nothing wrong with achieving small victories with minor interventions. The worry, however, is that the perceived simplicity and efficacy of such tactics will distract decision makers from more substantive efforts \u2014 for example, reducing electricity consumption by taxing it more heavily or investing in renewable energy resources.It is great that behavioral economics is receiving its due; the field has contributed significantly to our understanding of ourselves.

{"Headline": "The New American Dream Home Is One You Never Have to Leave", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "OpinionForget the game room and formal dining. You need space for aging parents and Airbnb guests.Supported byMs. Jackson is a real estate journalist. In the southwest corner of Elk Grove, Calif., about 15 miles outside of Sacramento, there\u2019s a shell of a shopping center that was partially built during the peak of the real estate bubble, then abandoned when the market crashed. Locals have taken to calling it the Ghost Mall. Look in one direction from the Ghost Mall and you\u2019ll see farmland. Turn the other way and you\u2019ll see what looks like a brand-new town being built from scratch.From a distance, the whole thing looks just like the kind of master-planned suburban community that went up along the outermost edges of cities all over America in the early 2000s, before the housing bubble burst. And in many ways, it is. But the American dream of homeownership has changed in the last decade \u2014 and so has the American dream home. A decade ago, a dream home was designed to wow your friends and neighbors. Today, it\u2019s designed to house your relatives. Or your Airbnb guests. And also be your workplace. Homebuilders say one of the biggest selling points in 2018 isn\u2019t a three-car garage or a grand entryway \u2014 it\u2019s a home with flexibility.Now, even as many housing markets have roared back from the bust to boom again, the American dream home is one you never have to leave.With big open rooms, stylish furniture and a walk-in closet off the master bedroom strategically staged with just a handful of purple and gray garments neatly draped on hangers, I knew I was in a nice house \u2014 maybe even someone\u2019s dream house. But the dream was tempered. The sales pitch seemed to take into account a new economic reality.The new emphasis on home flexibility means some once-standard rooms are disappearing. Most of the model homes I toured that day in Elk Grove did not have formal living rooms or dining rooms, floor-plan staples in new homes for at least a hundred years. That\u2019s not unusual. Lennar and other homebuilders say their most popular models today have \u201cgreat rooms\u201d that combine both, often with smaller total square footage.\u201cAs homes became smaller, rooms need to serve multiple purposes,\u201d said Kermit Baker, the American Institute of Architects\u2019 chief economist. The trade organization started its quarterly home design trends survey in 2005, around the peak of the previous boom, with heavy emphasis on specialized areas like game rooms, wine cellars and media rooms, Mr. Baker said. \u201cThose have largely given way to multipurpose spaces.\u201dIn the 1980s and \u201990s, home sizes swelled and the McMansion \u2014 mass-produced and developer-designed architectural abominations \u2014 cropped up everywhere. I asked Jon Jaffe, the president and chief operating officer of Lennar, what the biggest selling point was in the 2000s, just before the recession. \u201cIt was just bigger is better,\u201d he said.The empty or half-built McMansion ultimately became a symbol of that burst bubble, and the shaky mortgages that dragged the whole country down. You could see remnants of the bigger-is-better ethos down the road from another new Lennar community I toured in Elk Grove. Driving along the winding, suburban streets, I came across an older development, built during the previous boom by a different developer. The trees were taller, and the homes looked lived in, with American flags hanging near front doors and basketball hoops in the streets. Most of the decade-old homes felt a bit grander \u2014 some had little turrets and wrought-iron balconies. Others had three-car garages, front and center. The newer homes had less ornate exteriors and typically two-car garages.There was a for-sale sign in front of one of the older homes, a 3,200-square-foot, five-bedroom on a cul-de-sac that was built in 2004. With a quick property-records search, I found out that shortly after it was built, it sold for $457,000. Nine months later, it sold again for $573,000. In 2010, it went for just $285,000. This month it sold for $535,000.When the housing bubble burst a decade ago, property values dropped by as much as 60 percent in some areas. Millions of Americans lost their homes to foreclosure. Nationally, the median price of existing homes today is $269,600 \u2014 up 44 percent in the past six years. Many buyers are still recovering from the whiplash of the home-value roller coaster ride. In many parts of the country, the market\u2019s recovery has been so swift that prices have risen much faster than wages, up just 12 percent to 15 percent in the same period. It\u2019s harder to get back into the market if you don\u2019t already own a home. If you can buy something, your priority might be finding a home you\u2019ll never have to leave, even if your property values or personal fortunes fluctuate.\u201cOur customer, which is a home buyer, is feeling more and more frustrated and bewildered in the last decade,\u201d said Glenn Kelman, the chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate brokerage that has more than 1,000 agents.The assumption that homeownership is a sure path to building wealth feels shaky. For those who can even consider it, buying a home is often an anxiety-filled decision. How do you purchase a house you can hold onto if the bottom falls out again? Like the generation that came of age during the Depression and penny-pinched even when they were well-off later in life, buyers in their 20s and 30s today entered adulthood with the imprint of financial trauma. They know they need a backup plan.\u201cYou have the aging baby boomer,\u201d Mr. Jaffe said. \u201cAnd at the same time you\u2019ve got a lot of young adults coming home, out of college. They can\u2019t get a job. They\u2019re back living with Mom and Dad.\u201dJill Hill, a 37-year-old in Fort Worth, purchased a $349,000 home with a Next Gen suite in it about a year ago. She lives in the main house with her husband and two children, and her father lives in the attached unit. They reasoned it was less expensive to have everyone under one roof than to pay for a separate rental place for her father, who has health problems. Ms. Hill, who watched friends lose homes during the downturn a decade ago, said she was cautious about the type of loan she and her husband took to buy the home and looked for a home they could stay in for a while. \u201cI believe this is our forever home,\u201d she said. \u201cIf when my children get older and they aren\u2019t ready yet to move out, they could move into that place.\u201dThere are now dozens of new start-ups, like Avava Dwellings and Cover, that add similar units to existing homes, building them in backyards or converting garages. The New Home Company, a California-based developer, said floor plans with secondary master suites, casitas and accessory dwelling units address the multigenerational living trend and have grown in popularity over the past five years.\u201cToday, the conversations are about, \u2018I really want to buy a home that\u2019s going to last me 10 or 20 years,\u2019\u201d said Joan Marcus Webb, the chief marketing officer for the New Home Company. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer, \u2018I want to move after five years.\u2019\u201dIf the baby boomer\u2019s dream house was a multi-turreted McMansion with a formal living room, dining room and three-car garage, the millennial\u2019s might be a just-big-enough cottage-style bungalow with a home office, a rental unit and a carport that doubles as an outdoor living room.Ms. Marcus Webb said the New Home Company recently had architects draw up plans for a new home design that includes just that: a flexible, L-shaped outdoor living area that could be a living room, a carport or a place to park an Airstream. \u201cIt could either be a girl cave or your guest room,\u201d she said. \u201cOr a place for your parents.\u201dCandace Jackson is a California-based freelance journalist who covered real estate for The Wall Street Journal for seven years.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Another Tax Cut? Trump and Republicans Offer a Midterm Pitch, if Not a Plan", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 The 2017 Republican tax cuts have been a dud on the campaign trail ahead of the November midterm elections, so President Trump has come up with a new plan: more tax cuts.In Nevada on Saturday, Mr. Trump said he and Republican lawmakers had been working on \u201ca very major tax cut\u201d for middle-income people that would be rolled out in the coming weeks.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in an interview on Sunday that he had been working diligently with Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to develop another tax plan that would be released \u201cshortly.\u201d\u201cThis is specifically focused on the middle class and not beyond that,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in Jerusalem on the first stop of his six-country Middle East trip.Mr. Mnuchin said the president asked Treasury officials and Republican lawmakers to focus on developing a middle-class tax plan. But he could not offer details about which tax brackets might have lower rates or say if the package would include more generous deductions. Nor has anyone explained how \u2014 or whether \u2014 the plan would be financed or if it would again add to the nation\u2019s ballooning deficit.Last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut is expected to add $1 trillion to the nation\u2019s deficit, though Republican lawmakers continue to insist the tax bill will pay for itself with stronger economic growth.Mr. Mnuchin said the effect that the size and timing of the additional cuts would have on the nation\u2019s finances was being taken into consideration. That could mean that the administration would seek to offset the tax cuts with spending cuts, or by raising taxes on other groups of taxpayers.Mr. Mnuchin said the real driver of the debt was government spending, echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint that Democrats insisted on an increase in funding of domestic programs in exchange for approving more money for the military.House Republicans have moved to extend last year\u2019s individual tax cuts, which are set to expire in 2025, while the corporate tax cuts are permanent. The bill passed the House last month with little fanfare or effect on polling in key House races, and the legislation was dead on arrival in the Senate, where Republicans hold a razor-thin majority.\u201cThis would be different than what the House had already passed,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cIt\u2019s in addition, it\u2019s not instead of.\u201dThe Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress\u2019 independent scorekeeper for tax cuts, predicts that Americans earning $100,000 a year or more will reap 75 percent of the savings from the cuts next year. If Congress allows the individual income tax cuts to expire as planned, the committee predicts that middle-class and low-income Americans will face tax increases in 2025, while high earners as a group continue to enjoy a tax cut.Democrats have hammered the cuts as a giveaway to the wealthy, which is one reason the tax overhaul has not given Republicans the electoral benefits they expected.After racing the cuts through Congress in two months last year, and passing them without a single Democratic vote in either chamber, Republicans insisted that the new law would buoy their prospects in the midterms. Polling and candidate messaging suggest that has not been the case.Alan Rappeport reported from Jerusalem, and Jim Tankersley from Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Justice Dept. Accuses Russians of Interfering in Midterm Elections", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe woman, Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, 44, of St. Petersburg, managed a multimillion-dollar budget for the effort to \u201csow division and discord\u201d in the American political system, according to a criminal complaint. She bought internet domain names and Facebook and Instagram ads and spent money on building out Twitter accounts and paying to promote divisive posts on social media.As in 2016 \u2014 when American intelligence agencies assessed that Russia was trying to bolster the campaign of Donald J. Trump \u2014 the conspirators seized on divisions in American politics, prosecutors said in describing a yearslong effort called Project Lakhta. This year, the trolls wrote posts touching on immigration, guns, race relations, women and even the debate over the protests by National Football League players during the national anthem. Since April 2014, prosecutors said, Ms. Khusyaynova acted as the chief accountant for the project.But this time, prosecutors said the operatives appeared beholden to no particular candidate. Russia\u2019s trolls did not limit themselves to either a liberal or conservative position, according to the complaint. They often wrote from diverging viewpoints on the same issue.\u201cThe conspiracy has a strategic goal, which continues to this day, to sow division and discord in the U.S. political system,\u201d David Holt, an F.B.I. special agent, wrote in an affidavit.Prosecutors in Virginia, not Mr. Mueller\u2019s team, charged Ms. Khusyaynova of conspiring to defraud the United States. But those accusations appear to build on the special counsel\u2019s earlier indictment, which also identified companies controlled by Mr. Prigozhin that were named again in the new complaint.One of the companies, Concord Management and Consulting, has fought the special counsel\u2019s charges in court, demanding that the government demonstrate it willfully violated the law. Friday\u2019s criminal complaint, with its detailed descriptions of the conspiracy continuing for months after February\u2019s indictment, appears to do just that.Earlier Russian influence campaigns stood out for their clumsiness \u2014 Facebook posts from the Internet Research Agency, another arm of Project Lakhta that conducted Russia\u2019s social media disruption campaign in 2016, often contained broken English and off-topic cultural references.Operatives were instructed to attack Republicans who failed to sufficiently champion the construction of the border wall that Mr. Trump has sought; to stress the need for strict voter identification laws, especially in \u201cblue states\u201d; and to highlight \u201cscandals that took place when Mueller headed the F.B.I.\u201d in an attempt to discredit the special counsel\u2019s investigation.Acknowledging the time difference between Russia and the United States, one conspirator advised the others to post in the morning to attract liberal audiences during the American evening \u2014 \u201cL.G.B.T. groups are often active at night,\u201d the operative wrote \u2014 and to seek out conservatives awake in the morning by posting just before they left work for the day.They also developed strategies for blending in to partisan American audiences. \u201cIf you write posts in a liberal group \u2026 you must not use Breitbart titles,\u201d read one message sent to the Russian group, referring to the conservative American news site. \u201cOn the contrary, if you write posts in a conservative group, do not use Washington Post or BuzzFeed\u2019s titles.\u201dThe group also gave suggestions, some of them racist, for reaching specific affinity groups. One member suggested keeping posts simple when they were aimed at lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender groups of color, writing that \u201ccolored L.G.B.T. are less sophisticated than white; therefore, complicated phrases and messages do not work.\u201dFraming suggestions often accompanied news stories shared by the group\u2019s members, according to the complaint. One story, originally posted by the conservative news site World Net Daily, was titled \u201cThe 8 Dirtiest Scandals of Robert Mueller No One Is Talking About.\u201d When instructing a group member to share the story on social media, an unnamed member of the Russian group urged colleagues to \u201cemphasize that the work of this commission is damaging to the country and is aimed to declare impeachment of Trump,\u201d according to the complaint.Much of the social media content included in the complaint was fairly standard fodder for partisan Facebook pages. In 2017, a fake Facebook account called Bertha Malone was used by the Russians to post an image falsely claiming that former President Obama had ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. More than one million people saw the account, according to the complaint.Another 2017 post, by a fake account called Rachell Edison, was used to post an image about the National Rifle Association. The text accompanying the image read \u201cI think next 4 years will be great for all Americans, and for gun lovers especially!\u201dAny effect on the midterm elections is all but impossible to calculate. The disruption effort that prosecutors described went beyond the United States, targeting elections and referendums in Ukraine and the European Union.Ms. Khusyaynova was fastidious, keeping detailed records of expenses for a budget that totaled more than $35 million from January 2016 to June 2018. Between January and June 2018 alone, prosecutors said, the project\u2019s proposed operating budget totaled more than $10 million.She routinely requested funds from Mr. Prigozhin\u2019s companies. In one instance, she asked for 15 million rubles, or about $230,000, on Feb. 16, coincidentally the same day that Mr. Prigozhin and the other Russians were indicted.Ms. Khusyaynova\u2019s responsibilities also included more mundane tasks like paying salaries and renting office space.Prosecutors said that the Russians tried to hide what they were doing, disguising payments as software support and development from entities controlled by Mr. Prigozhin. Affiliates of his companies used 14 bank accounts to finance Project Lakhta.Friday\u2019s announcement was the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s pledge to inform Americans of any foreign election meddling. The Justice Department had little reason otherwise to unseal the complaint; Ms. Khusyaynova lives in Russia, which does not have to extradite its citizens to the United States. Typically, the F.B.I. and Justice Department would keep the charges quiet and hope Ms. Khusyaynova might travel to a country where she could be detained.\u201cExposing schemes to the public is an important way to neutralize them,\u201d the deputy attorney general, Rod J. Rosenstein, said in July. \u201cThe American people have a right to know if foreign governments are targeting them with propaganda.\u201dMr. Trump, who has been widely criticized for his reluctance to acknowledge and occasional outright dismissals of Moscow\u2019s interference on his behalf, stressed on Friday that his administration had sought to protect elections, accusing the Obama administration of keeping quiet about the issue in 2016.\u201cIt had nothing to do with my campaign,\u201d he told reporters while traveling in Arizona.United States intelligence agencies said separately on Friday that they believed foreign interference continued to be a threat to American democracy.\u201cWe are concerned about ongoing campaigns by Russia, China and other foreign actors, including Iran, to undermine confidence in democratic institutions and influence public sentiment and government policies,\u201d said a statement from the director of national intelligence, the Homeland Security Department, the F.B.I. and other agencies.Julian E.

{"Headline": "Nikki Haley Pokes Fun at Trump, and Herself, at Al Smith Dinner", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNikki R. Haley joked about President Trump\u2019s braggadocio in his United Nations speech last month. Once, she said, he asked if she belonged to the same Native American tribe as Senator Elizabeth Warren. And as a member of Mr. Trump\u2019s cabinet, she added, \u201cIt is a thrill to be out to dinner without being harassed.\u201dFor about 17 minutes Thursday night in the New York Hilton ballroom, Ms. Haley, Mr. Trump\u2019s soon-to-be-leaving ambassador to the United Nations, tried her hand at one-liners before a crowd of 700 guests at the annual Al Smith charity dinner, a high-powered event of the political and Roman Catholic elite hosted by Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan.It was a sort of let-loose opportunity for Ms. Haley, 46, a Republican star who is widely thought to have presidential ambitions \u2014 although she has dismissed the idea of running against Mr. Trump, with whom she appears to have a good relationship.Still, it remains unclear precisely why Ms. Haley is leaving her United Nations post after less than two years, and her monologue did nothing to provide answers.But she joked about it. Having breakfast with Cardinal Dolan a few weeks ago to prepare for her speech, she told the crowd, \u201cI asked, \u2018Was there anything I could do to really boost attendance?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Why don\u2019t you resign as U.N. ambassador?\u2019\u201dMs. Haley said the president also called her with some advice.\u201cJust brag about my accomplishments,\u201d she quoted him as recommending. \u201cIt really killed at the U.N., I\u2019ve got to tell you.\u201dMs. Haley is the daughter of immigrants from India, who grew up in the South and became South Carolina\u2019s first female governor and first minority governor. She had a little fun with that, too.The benefit of growing up as an Indian-American who experienced discrimination in South Carolina, Ms. Haley said, was that it \u201ctotally prepared me for being a Republican in New York.\u201dBut Ms. Haley wasn\u2019t satisfied. She joked that the newspaper had merely \u201cchanged the headline to \u2018Obama Creates High-Paying Jobs in the Curtain Industry.\u201dMs. Haley also complained about other fake headlines, including one that said the rapper Kanye West had been sworn in as her replacement. \u201cOh wait, that could really happen,\u201d she said.Ms. Haley was introduced as guest speaker by the dinner\u2019s master of ceremonies, the comedian Jim Gaffigan, who said, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how Nikki Haley has exited this administration with such dignity.\u201dSeated on the three-tiered dais in the Hilton ballroom, Ms. Haley and her husband, Michael, were surrounded by powerful figures in New York government, finance, media, real estate and philanthropy. They included Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio, former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Senator Chuck Schumer, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, the Wall Street financier Stephen A. Schwarzman and the television journalists Maria Bartiromo of Fox News and Jeff Glor of CBS News.Her notice, which took many White House officials by surprise, immediately stirred recurrent speculation that Ms. Haley might run for office again and possibly even challenge Mr. Trump. But Ms. Haley emphatically denied such a prospect when she appeared with the president at the White House on Oct. 9 to formally announce her resignation.On the contrary, Ms. Haley said she intended to campaign for Mr. Trump\u2019s re-election. And Mr. Trump said he hoped she would return to work for him.Despite her assurances of fealty to the president, Ms. Haley\u2019s departure from the administration will enable her to distance herself from any setbacks that may be suffered by the Republicans in the November midterm elections, which are less than three weeks away.Coming into the job with little diplomatic experience, Ms. Haley has nonetheless been something of a foreign policy star in the Trump administration and one of its few prominent women. She has been seen as a steady voice in the midst of White House turnover and dysfunction.The annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation dinner, as it is formally known, has evolved into a prominent political showcase over its seven decades.Its keynote speakers have included presidents, presidential candidates and diplomatic and cultural figures like Winston Churchill, Tony Blair, John F. Kennedy and Bob Hope.The speakers often serve up self-deprecating jokes, coupled with messages of morality and the charitable work of the foundation, which this year raised nearly $4 million for Catholic children\u2019s charities.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "FIFA Says Saudi State Funds Won\u2019t Pay for New Tournaments", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIGALI, Rwanda \u2014 FIFA moved to quell months of speculation that Saudi Arabia would invest billions in two new soccer tournaments by writing to its board to say that any possible deal will not include cash from state-owned investment funds.The claim is detailed in a lengthy document sent to members of FIFA\u2019s governing council before a key meeting here on Friday. Gianni Infantino \u2014 amid opposition from European soccer leaders \u2014 will ask members to back his contentious plans for a World Cup for clubs and a new league for nations.The meeting could be explosive, with European officials threatening to walk out before a vote can be taken. Infantino angered many in the game by asking the FIFA Council to allow him to make a multibillion-dollar agreement with a fund whose identity he declined to identify. They refused his request, demanding more information.Since then, The New York Times has obtained documents that show the offer was made by a Japanese conglomerate, SoftBank, a company that has partnered with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to create the world\u2019s largest technology investment fund. The offer came as Saudi Arabia moved to invest in sports as part of a plan to diversify its economy beyond oil. Saudi sports officials have declined to say whether they are part of the offer to FIFA, and SoftBank has not commented.Infantino has been particularly focused on Saudi Arabia over the past year, visiting three times. He also met with the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman.\u201cFIFA would not enter into a joint venture for this purpose whether directly or indirectly with sovereign wealth fund of individual states,\u201d FIFA said in a consultation paper.In recent weeks the organization has also been privately saying that the links between the SoftBank-led offer and Saudi Arabia are not as strong as has been reported. That effort has grown since grisly details emerged about the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the country\u2019s consulate in Turkey earlier this month.FIFA did not say who is financing the offer, though officials had privately said as long ago as April that it was backed by Middle Eastern, Chinese and American money.Infantino declined to rule out Saudi investment when he met with reporters in June. \u201cWhoever invests in sport generally I think is welcome provided we do the things in an appropriate way,\u201d he said.Finances are just one part of the problem. Soccer politics is also writ large over the discussions.While FIFA owns the World Cup, UEFA is considerably richer thanks to its control of the Champions League. UEFA collects $15 billion in revenue over a four-year cycle, or almost three times what FIFA brings in during the same time.A new Club World Cup and the national-team league could be a major improvement on FIFA\u2019s other men\u2019s events outside of the World Cup. Under the proposals, the little-loved Confederations Cup, a World Cup warm up, would be scrapped, as would the current Club World Cup, an annual tournament in December.At Friday\u2019s meeting, council members will be asked to choose between two options for the new Club World Cup, should they agree to scrap the current tournament. One is the plan for an expanded quadrennial event, and another is for it to be played annually during the summer.Advertisement"}

Its 7,857 square feet include five bedrooms and six full bathrooms. All of the rooms have oversized windows, and the living room, in the back of the house, opens on three sides to outdoor spaces with the same Mexican tile and mahogany finishes found inside.A walkway cuts a path through the center of the backyard to a large lap pool, a brick barbecue and a palapa, or thatched structure, overlooking the ocean.\u201cThe views are amazing,\u201d said Luis Gonzalez, an agent with Holden Sotheby\u2019s International Realty in Cabarete, one of the property\u2019s listing brokers. \u201cYou get great views of the ocean and the rocks below the cliff.\u201dThe owners, a family from California, have used it as a vacation home for the last five years, Mr. Gonzalez said. They are including all furnishings in the sale.The gated estate is entered via a stone driveway with a covered, two-car carport on one side. A large wooden door opens to an entry hall that stretches back to the yard and tropical gardens behind the house. To the right of the hall is a den that could be used as a TV room or library; to the left is a formal dining room that opens to a chef\u2019s kitchen with granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances. At the end of the hall is the living room, anchored by an ornate iron chandelier, with large sliding doors that open to covered patios on two sides and the backyard in the rear. Although the living area is on one main level, soaring beamed ceilings throughout \u2014 reaching as high as 35 feet in some places \u2014 offer additional mezzanine space. Two of the guest suites have sizable sleeping lofts, and a small stairway off the kitchen leads up to the staff quarters.The en suite bedrooms are in a separate wing of the house and include a large master suite with a seating area, a marble bath with a whirlpool tub, and a covered terrace. In all, there are two king and nine queen beds in the house, making it well suited for large gatherings. The 250-acre Sea Horse Ranch resort offers numerous amenities, including tennis courts, an equestrian center, pools, a beach club and beach access. It is just outside the town of Cabarete in the Puerto Plata province (population around 330,000), about 19 miles from the city of Puerto Plata and a short drive from Isabel de Torres National Park. It is seven miles from Gregorio Luper\u00f3n International Airport and about 140 miles north of Santo Domingo, the capital city on the southern coast.Although the Dominican Republic\u2019s housing market slowed after the 2008 global financial crisis, \u201cit never fell as much as other parts of the Caribbean and the world,\u201d said William Holden, the broker-owner of Holden Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.In the years since, he said, the market has been \u201con a slow uptrend,\u201d thanks to a stable economy and an increase in tourism. Popular tourist spots along the southern and eastern coasts, like Casa de Campo and Punta Cana, have seen more growth than those on the northern coast, where there are fewer international flights and tourist attractions, real estate agents said.Mr. Holden estimated that sales volume in the northern region is up around 2 percent from last year, although he and others said that prices have remained level. Luxury properties in the Cabarete area typically start at about $200,000 for an older, two- or three-bedroom condominium farther from the water, agents said, while oceanfront homes in newer luxury developments, like Sea Horse Ranch, sell for at least $700,000.Several new oceanfront luxury condominiums have been built in the last decade, Mr. Holden said, with unit prices ranging from $500,000 to $2 million.Americans and Canadians looking for vacation or retirement homes make up a large portion of the foreign buyers in the Dominican Republic, real estate professionals said, noting that there is also strong interest from Europeans, particularly those in France, Italy, Spain and Germany.Mr. Holden said he has also seen a growing number of Russian buyers, as well as a recent influx of Venezuelans. \u201cIt\u2019s very stable politically, and property rights are very secure,\u201d he said of the Dominican Republic.Buyers on the northern coast are typically drawn to the miles of sandy and rocky beaches, as well as the excellent surfing and sailing, particularly in Cabarete.Other buyers are lured by the diverse terrain. \u201cIn the north coast we have mountains, and rivers where you can go rafting,\u201d Ms. Mertes-Urbahn said. \u201cThe area is also famous for surfing. And there\u2019s snorkeling. It\u2019s more diverse here.\u201dThere are generally no restrictions on foreign ownership of property in the Dominican Republic.Local financing is available, but usually at less attractive terms than many buyers could get at home, Mr. Suero said, so most international buyers pay in cash or obtain loans elsewhere.Although it is not required, buyers are advised to hire an experienced local lawyer to represent them during the transaction, which usually takes around 45 days. The lawyer will oversee due diligence on the property, Mr. Suero said, arranging for a title search and appraisal, among other things. Legal fees are usually 1 to 2 percent of the sale price of a property, although they are negotiable.Closing documents must be notarized. Notaries, who are required to have a law degree, charge a nonnegotiable fee based on the property\u2019s value.Spanish; Dominican peso (1 Dominican peso = $0.02)Sellers typically pay the real estate agent\u2019s commission, which ranges from 4 to 8 percent of the sale price. Buyers are responsible for a number of closing costs, including a transfer and stamp tax.The annual property taxes on this home are $7,000, Mr. Gonzalez said, and monthly homeowner association fees, which cover common-area maintenance, security and garbage collection, are $755.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Now for Rent: Email Addresses and Phone Numbers for Millions of Trump Supporters", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNow, consultants close to the Trump campaign are ramping up efforts to put that database \u2014 by far the most sought-after in Republican politics \u2014 to use, offering it for rent to candidates, conservative groups and even businesses.It is an arrangement that has the potential to help the Republican Party in key midterm races, while providing a source of revenue for President Trump\u2019s campaign and the consultants involved.It has also set off concerns about diluting the power of one of Mr. Trump\u2019s most potent political assets, while raising questions about whether his team is facilitating the sort of political profiteering that he disparaged during his campaign.It is not unusual for candidates to rent supporter data to \u2014 or from \u2014 other campaigns. The new effort by Mr. Trump\u2019s team, however, appears to be the first time the campaign of a sitting president facing re-election has opted to market its list.Federal election law allows campaigns and political action committees to sell or rent their lists, provided that the payments received are fair market value.In recent weeks, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, which is not known for its adherence to political norms, quietly signed a contract with a newly formed Virginia-based company called Excelsior Strategies to market the emails and cellphone numbers \u2014 what is known in the political industry as first-party data.Excelsior is offering the chance to email Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters at a rate of $35 per 1,000 addresses \u2014 or more if the renter also wants to push posts into the Facebook timelines of supporters \u2014 according to interviews and marketing emails obtained by The New York Times. The firm has also explored the possibility of clients\u2019 being able to send text messages directly to the phones of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters, according to the marketing emails and interviews.Those contacts could be of tremendous benefit to Republican candidates or political groups around the country seeking to capitalize on their base\u2019s enthusiasm for the president.\u201cRepublicans have suffered from being behind in small-dollar fund-raising, and the president, over the course of the campaign and his presidency, has built the largest Republican first-party data list,\u201d said Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign manager Brad Parscale, who engineered the agreement. \u201cSo giving other candidates and groups access to that data through a legal means to rent it was one of the best things I could do for the Republican ecosystem. And the campaign makes a little money, too. It\u2019s a win-win.\u201dSo far, parts of the list have been rented to a number of Republican candidates \u2014 including the gubernatorial campaign of Ron DeSantis in Florida and the Senate campaign of Josh Hawley in Missouri \u2014 as well as nonprofit groups advocating the confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, and even to an author promoting a pro-Trump book, according to people familiar with the arrangement.The Trump campaign maintains ownership of the list as well as veto authority over all rentals, according to interviews and the marketing emails. One such email indicates that \u201cas long as the political group, org, nonprofit or business is not hostile to the president, then they are most likely able to use the data with no problem.\u201dIt is not clear whether the president, who is known to abhor the prospect of others\u2019 profiting from their affiliations with him, is aware of the details of the arrangement.The people familiar with the arrangement said that the rentals so far had been sparing, but that the volume began increasing in recent weeks as key midterm races began heating up.It is unclear how much the arrangement has yielded for Excelsior, Campaign Inbox or the Trump campaign to date. That is partly because such transactions may not be completely traceable through campaign finance filings and partly because the filings on record mostly only cover expenditures through the end of June \u2014 before the arrangement was completed.The arrangement replaces an earlier one that had relied on companies owned by Mr. Parscale, a close confidant of the Trump family who had played a key role in building the list as the digital director of Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. During that campaign, his company, Giles-Parscale, was by far the biggest vendor, receiving nearly $88 million in payments, though most of the money was probably passed through to Facebook and other platforms for ads.In the months after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, another company owned by Mr. Parscale began quietly renting out the list to a few campaigns, though people who work with the Trump campaign said that he did little to solicit such rentals.He approached Mike Shields, a veteran political consultant who had helped found his own company, Convergence Media, after the election. Mr. Shields recommended a top executive at Convergence, Tom Newhouse, who had worked at the National Republican Congressional Committee.One employee of Excelsior and Convergence wrote to Republican consultants last month that \u201cConvergence Media recently started a partnership with the Trump campaign to be the exclusive broker of all of their campaign data, including their donor data.\u201d The data, the employee said, \u201cis currently available to be used for email and Facebook advertising,\u201d adding that text messaging and online advertising should be available soon.Within the new initiative, there has been some confusion about the precise roles and relationships of the companies involved. Rob Simms, who helped found Convergence with Mr. Shields said, \u201cConvergence Media is not a vendor to the Donald J. Trump for President campaign.\u201dMr. Parscale praised both the Convergence team and Mr. Newhouse as responsible stewards of the Trump campaign\u2019s data.\u201cThis first-party data is very sensitive and valuable, and you don\u2019t want to have a lot of people in it,\u201d he said. \u201cTom has an outstanding reputation, and I trust him. There are a lot of bad actors in town and I don\u2019t think he is one of them.\u201dStill, there are practical reasons to avoid widespread rentals of the Trump campaign list, warned Cyrus Krohn, who helped build the Republican National Committee\u2019s list into a digital force as the committee\u2019s digital director during the 2008 election cycle.\u201cWe\u2019ve already become so inundated with an influx of political messaging that I would be concerned about oversaturating supporters with emails,\u201d said Mr. Krohn, who left Washington and now runs a technology start-up in Seattle. \u201cThe response rates are going to degrade and the performance is going to wane.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But Netflix has been trading around $310 a share lately, after surpassing $400 earlier this year.In a nutshell, the problem is the disparity between money in and money out \u2014 and Professor Damodaran\u2019s presumption that Netflix\u2019s costs must remain high, if it is to keep growing.Netflix\u2019s cash-flow statement indicates that in the 12 months through September, it spent $11.7 billion on new content. But its income statement indicates that total revenues were $14.9 billion, leaving it only about $3.2 billion to pay for marketing and the rest of its operations. That wasn\u2019t enough to run the business, so the company has borrowed money.Professor Damodaran is not the only Netflix skeptic. In a note to investors on Oct. 17, Michael Nathanson, a senior analyst with MoffettNathanson, said that the company\u2019s stock price was baffling, and he estimated that a more realistic level was about $210.In a similar vein, Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities and a longtime critic, said he expected Netflix to continue to have difficulty matching costs and cash flow, given increasing competition in streaming video \u2014 and the likely loss of movies and TV shows controlled by its competitors.Disney and Time Warner (which owns HBO) are revamping their offerings. And Hulu (owned collectively by Disney and Comcast), Apple, Amazon and Google (which owns YouTube) are now all serious adversaries, he said. In his estimation, Netflix stock is worth only about $150 a share.If Netflix were to fall anywhere near that level \u2014 losing a gut-wrenching half of its market value \u2014 its corporate competitors would presumably be powering ahead with their own streaming offerings. Yet it would not be surprising if some of them \u2014 the recently merged AT&T-Time Warner entity, for example \u2014 wondered whether their own marriages made much sense without Netflix\u2019s unbidden influence.How worried should the stock market be about Netflix? It has shrugged off such concerns most of this year: From Jan. 1 through July 9, Netflix\u2019s shares returned a staggering 118 percent.Since July 9, however, tech stocks have fallen and Netflix has been pummeled. Despite brief surges, its share price has dropped more than 25 percent since that peak.\u201cYou get a show or a movie you\u2019re really dying to watch, and you end up staying up late at night, so we actually compete with sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re winning!\u201dIn the latest earnings call, he said that deep-pocketed companies, like Disney, AT&T and Google, were real competitors. \u201cSomeday there will have to be competition for wallet share; we\u2019re not na\u00efve about that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems very far off from everything we\u2019ve seen.\u201dNetflix, he said, needs to continue to be \u201cfocusing on our fundamentals\u201d \u2014 supplying viewers with compelling entertainment and delivering it in innovative ways.But that will cost the company a lot of money. For consumers, that may not be a problem at all. Netflix has already made video entertainment far more abundant and diverse than it was just a few years ago, and as other companies join the fray, the cornucopia of choices is likely to become even deeper.But does that make Netflix a great stock? You may want to look closely at the numbers.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySlowdowns in investment and retail sales are cooling one of the world\u2019s most important economic engines. As the trade war with the U.S. intensifies, the downturn could get worse. Sputtering growth, soaring debt and an escalating trade war with the United States are increasingly weighing on China\u2019s economy. China\u2019s government on Friday reported that the economy grew by 6.5 percent over the three months that ended in September compared with a year ago. While fast by global standards, the pace is China\u2019s slowest since early 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis.China has reported growth figures over the past two years that painted a picture of an economy that is gamely chugging along, despite the country\u2019s lingering problems and widespread doubts over the reliability of official numbers. A different narrative is emerging this year, one of a slowing economy that is forcing Beijing to make some difficult choices.China\u2019s stock market is firmly in the red \u2014 it has fallen by more than one-quarter since a peak in January \u2014 making it one of the world\u2019s worst performing. Companies are complaining that they cannot get money from lenders, and a handful are defaulting on their loans. The currency has weakened and is hovering near a 10-year low against the American dollar. So far it has only marginally dented China\u2019s $12 trillion economy. In recent weeks, Chinese officials have pointed to figures that show overall trade remains robust despite the conflict. On Friday, Chinese officials introduced an unusual public effort to reassure businesses and investors that China was on the right track. They blamed the lower-than-expected economic figures on global factors but said the government would take steps to keep growth on course.\u201cWe have no reason not to be confident in the bright prospects for China\u2019s economic development,\u201d Liu He, China\u2019s economic czar, told the official Xinhua news agency. China\u2019s stock market rebounded from a Friday drop after the comments from Mr. Liu and other top officials. During periods of economic slowdown, China has turned to local governments to prompt growth through big infrastructure and development projects. That approach fueled growth but saddled key parts of the economy with debt.China\u2019s expanding middle class and its increasingly expensive consumption habits have been an important pillar for growth as China moves away from its dependence on exports and big investment projects.Retail sales stayed buoyant, rising 9.2 percent in September from the previous year, as Chinese consumers continued to buy cars, appliances, smartphones and other goods. The strong numbers will help officials in Beijing to argue that the trade war has left China\u2019s domestic economy largely untouched.But economists warn that the overall rosy picture could change. For example, car sales began to slow in September, according to the China Passenger Car Association. \u201cA month from now may be just the time retailers start to buckle,\u201d wrote analysts at China Beige Book International. The group, which surveys big businesses in China, said retailers reported the worst payroll health of any sector in recent months.In September, the United States put tariffs on $200 billion worth of products coming from China. President Trump has given no indication that he will back down anytime soon.Chinese export figures for September jumped 14.5 percent compared with a year earlier. That unlikely number probably is not a sign that trade is doing well. Some exporters attributed the rise to American companies ramping up orders before new tariffs make their purchases more expensive.While much of the impact of the trade war has yet to be felt, experts say it won\u2019t take long for a slowing economy to start to feel the pinch, especially as officials grapple with other economic problems. The trade war could shave as much as 1.6 percent off China\u2019s economic growth figures next year, according to a recent report from the International Monetary Fund.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to see it in the numbers that are provided and that will just add to the uncertainty,\u201d said Paul Gruenwald, global chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to pinpoint any pressure because we don\u2019t have enough data.\u201d But, he added, \u201cthere is definitely pessimism. It\u2019s just a question of how much it will slow things down.\u201dJust before releasing the economic growth figures on Friday morning, the websites for China\u2019s central bank, insurance and securities regulators posted news media interviews with senior officials giving support to the market. The chairman of the securities regulator went as far as to appeal to certain market participants to buy stocks.\u201cWe encourage private equity funds to purchase shares of listed companies and participate in mergers and acquisitions of listed companies,\u201d said Liu Shiyu, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.Liu He, the economic czar, said later that day to Xinhua that trade frictions with the United States had hurt the stock market, \u201cbut the psychological effect is bigger than the actual impact, frankly speaking.\u201dHe added that the United States and China were in contact, without elaborating. Trade discussions were put on hold in September after the Chinese government declined an invitation by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hold fresh talks.Mr. Liu and Liu Shiyu were joined on Friday by Guo Shuqing, China's top banking regulator, and Yi Gang, who runs China\u2019s central bank, in publicly supporting the market. The coordinated effort by the four most important economic officials in China revealed a high level of concern on the part of the government, said Andrew Polk, a founder of Trivium, a Beijing consulting firm.\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that they need all the heavy hitters out there talking up the markets in order to assuage people\u2019s concerns,\u201d said Mr. Polk. \u201cI find it very remarkable that they chose this strategy, and somewhat alarming.\u201d\u2014 Cao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}

It is what you never learned that might have saved you.\u201dActually, it\u2019s worse than that. Donald Trump appointed the former Texas governor Rick Perry as energy secretary. Perry, who once said he wanted to abolish the department (he also wanted to abolish Commerce and Education), is a figurehead, his role \u201cceremonial and bizarre.\u201d According to Lewis, Perry didn\u2019t ask for a briefing on any D.O.E. program when he arrived. The real work of sorting out the department was given to Thomas Pyle, a lobbyist funded by the carbon-addled Koch Industries and ExxonMobil. Trump\u2019s goal was to rid the place of Obama supporters and climate change analysts, and to aggrandize the oil and coal sectors. Pyle was followed by a group of young ideologues called the \u201cBeachhead Team.\u201d Lewis quotes Tarak Shah, chief of staff for the department\u2019s $6 billion basic-science program: \u201cWe had tried desperately to prepare them \u2026 but that required them to show up. And bring qualified people. But they didn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t ask for even an introductory briefing. Like, \u2018What do you do?\u2019\u201dThis is an enormity in Lewis\u2019s algorithmic world: \u201cAfter Trump took office, D. J. Patil watched with wonder as the data disappeared across the federal government.\u201d The disappearing data concerned phenomena that the Trumpers opposed, like climate change or food safety regulations, or that they didn\u2019t care about, like poverty, or stuff that they assumed were government boondoggles, which was most everything not involving the Pentagon. They cut funding for data collection across the board.Lewis has spent his career writing from an ironic middle distance. He is deft, not didactic. He doesn\u2019t proselytize or offer solutions to fix our ailing democracy, which makes \u201cThe Fifth Risk\u201d all the more effective as a call to arms \u2014 especially to his natural audience of (mostly) guys who like sports and moneymaking. At a moment when the president of the United States is under frontal assault, Lewis takes a more oblique route. He doesn\u2019t bother with Trump\u2019s flagrant character deficiencies; he is horrified by the practical effects of the president\u2019s ignorance. And so he deploys his skills to make the history of the National Weather Service\u2019s ability to predict hurricanes \u2014 and its difficulty in predicting tornadoes \u2014 into a page-turner. \u201cIf a hurricane is another night in a bad marriage,\u201d he writes, \u201ca tornado is a blind date.\u201d A metaphor lurks here: Donald Trump is a tornado, witlessly devastating the world that Michael Lewis has come to love and chronicle.But there is more than lost data at stake. \u201cThe Fifth Risk\u201d raises the most important question of the moment: Have we grown too lazy and silly and poorly educated to sustain a working democracy? We live in a moment when tribal bumper stickers \u2014 both left and right \u2014 pass for politics, when ignorance and grievance drive policy. The federal government exists at a level of complexity most people just can\u2019t be bothered to understand. We have little idea what it does, only the vague sense that it doesn\u2019t do anything very well. Michael Lewis has taken on the task of rectifying that misconception, and he has done so with refreshing clarity \u2014 and a measured sense of outrage \u2014 which makes this his most ambitious and important book.An earlier version of this review misidentified the discoverer of penicillin.

And now that competition could extend into a battle for investors as the companies push for stock market debuts in 2019.The first to go public would get dibs on investors eager for a piece of the ride-hailing business. That could be especially important for Lyft, given that its I.P.O. would most likely be swamped by its much bigger rival\u2019s, whose offering would be the biggest to hit the market since Alibaba\u2019s in 2014.Positive earnings reports, including from Goldman Sachs and Netflix, were factors, as were strong economic data, which showed a fourth straight month of industrial production gains and job openings at a record high.The ratio for the companies in the S.&P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher.

{"Headline": "Behind the Clash Over Italy\u2019s Budget, a Fear of Populism", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Just a few years ago, the European Union faced down a populist Greek government whose debts threatened the common currency, the euro, and the very integrity of the bloc.But if the European Union thought the problem was behind it, it is now back \u2014 and bigger and more dangerous than ever \u2014 in Italy, whose populist government is also insisting on breaching bloc rules for fiscal discipline in order to keep faith with its voters.This clash between an elected government that ran on increasing public spending and the technocrats of Brussels encapsulates the dilemma at the heart of the European Union \u2014 its democratic deficit as it tries to manage a currency shared by differing sovereign states without a common budget or finance minister.But looming behind the current clash over the budget lies a much deeper fear in the European Union: that it will give more fuel to a populist, euroskeptic wave across the Continent before elections for a new European Parliament in May.So far, European populism has played out on national stages. But a major showing by populists in the European elections would sharply change the balance of power in the European Parliament, affecting the makeup of the European Commission \u2014 the executive branch of the bloc \u2014 and potentially rendering European Union institutions even more ineffective.This larger political anxiety is part of the real debate over how to handle Italy and its defiant budget, European officials say.As the Italian deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini, a right-wing populist from the League, has used the migration issue to bash Brussels and increase his popularity, his coalition partner and rival, Luigi Di Maio, a left-wing populist from the Five Star Movement, is expected to use the clash over the budget to raise his own standing at home.If divisions in the Greek and Portuguese governments undercut their challenges to Brussels, \u201cthe divisions in the Italian coalition all serve to reinforce the need to stick it to Brussels and stand firm both on fiscal policy and migration,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, chief European analyst for the Eurasia Group, a consultancy.Mr. Salvini has vowed to cut taxes, while Mr. Di Maio has pledged a guaranteed income for the unemployed and the poor. Both want to keep their promises.The fear in Brussels is that if the technocrats are too tough on the Italians, they could galvanize support for Mr. Salvini and the rest of Europe\u2019s populists and create institutional challenges for the bloc for the next five years at least.\u201cThe current Italian government has its own dose of preposterousness,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018But it\u2019s still elected. They have signed agreements with Brussels and should honor them, but elected governments also have the ability to change their minds. And there\u2019s no good answer on how you punish a country.\u201dThe European Union enforced its will on tiny Greece, which was in desperate straits, Ms. Demertzis said. \u201cThe way that 27 nations imposed themselves on a sovereign nation is still something we haven\u2019t gotten our heads around. This is where the E.U. attempts to square a circle and the democratic deficit comes in.\u201dThe result is that \u201cGreece is no longer a sovereign country, but exists in a debtor-creditor relationship with Brussels,\u201d Ms. Demertzis said. \u201cIt creates a lot of resentment and anger.\u201dOf course, Italy is not Greece, and it has much more room to maneuver. Italy is still able to finance itself, and the markets \u2014 which had forced Greece and Portugal to concede \u2014 are ambivalent, seeing more of a political crisis today than an economic one.A serious debt crisis for Italy is still only hypothetical, if more plausible now than before. But given Italy\u2019s size and its status as a core country of the bloc, a crisis, should it come, could be unmanageable and have consequences not just for the European economy but also for the world.Italy is the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy, and it has a cumulative debt of some $2.6 trillion \u2014 among the world\u2019s top five debt loads, and at nearly 132 percent of gross domestic product, more than twice the maximum of 60 percent allowed under European rulesThe debt is so large that even though some 70 percent of it is held domestically, there is significant exposure for German, French and American banks. But a crisis would badly hurt Italians first of all, including small-business leaders who voted for this government, so it is unlikely that Rome wants to throw itself over the cliff.Still, if investors get really frightened and the cost of Italian borrowing spikes down the road, Italy\u2019s debt payments could get out of control. The Greek bailout cost about $300 billion, and Greece is tiny compared with Italy, whose economy is nearly 10 times as large.Then the European Central Bank would have to decide whether Italy really is too big to fail, especially if the stakes include the very existence of the euro currency. \u201cWould European countries really be prepared to break the euro?\u201d asked Ms. Demertzis of Bruegel.So the nightmare is out there, distant on the horizon. And that, of course, is another part of the balance that Brussels is seeking, as officials emphasize that they are open to dialogue with Italy over its budget, and some economists suggest that given Italy\u2019s essentially stagnant growth \u2014 under 1 percent a year \u2014 some fiscal expansion might be beneficial. Still, in the longer run, the message goes, what Italy is doing is incompatible with membership in the euro and the single market.Italy has three weeks to respond to the European Commission, but it probably would not pass a budget until the end of the year. The commission could then put Italy into something called the \u201cexcess deficit procedure,\u201d which could eventually lead to fines and sanctions.But all that will take time \u2014 and the May elections are not so far away.\u201cIt\u2019s all about timing,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about democracy and membership. And this is the issue that policymakers in France, Germany and Brussels are most concerned about.\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was appointed in 1975 by President Gerald R.

The president\u2019s language is unlikely to be helpful to them.Although the president\u2019s comment was striking about Ms. Clifford, who has graphically described Mr. Trump\u2019s genitals in a recent memoir, it was hardly unique.Mr. Trump has accused women of having \u201cfat, ugly\u201d faces and of repelling voters because of their looks. He called one woman a \u201ccrazed, crying lowlife\u201d and said another was a \u201cdog\u201d who had the \u201cface of a pig.\u201d He said Hillary Clinton\u2019s bathroom break during a 2015 presidential debate was \u201ctoo disgusting\u201d to talk about.

Calling the president\u2019s comment \u201cadolescent,\u201d Ms. Walsh said that \u201cyou cannot continue to be a party in power if the voters that you are appealing to are white men over the age of 60.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s turn toward juvenile mockery illustrates why even those Republicans who were buoyed by the bounce they received in the aftermath of Justice Brett M.

Voters learned just weeks before Election Day that he had bragged that he could \u201cgrab \u2019em by the pussy.\u201d He has continued to make crude comments about women\u2019s bodies since taking office, repeatedly testing the limits of the public\u2019s acceptance of a president\u2019s locker-room vocabulary.A White House spokeswoman declined to comment for this article.Here are some of the president\u2019s most remarkable attacks on women over the years:When he attacks women, as he did with Ms. Clifford in his tweet on Tuesday, Mr. Trump often goes after their faces.The president often expresses his ire by comparing women to animals, an effort to dehumanize his opponents that he also uses against men. At a campaign rally in December 2015, Mr. Trump called attention to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s bathroom break during an earlier Democratic presidential debate, eliciting cheers from his supporters.Perhaps most common is Mr. Trump\u2019s fixation on the overall appearance of women. He often uses their looks as a way of diminishing their abilities, their intelligence or their effectiveness \u2014 sometimes all three. Attacking a woman\u2019s looks has become his standard response to female critics and rivals.Scott Reed, a veteran Republican strategist who oversees the U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u2019s political affairs, pleaded with the president on Tuesday not to get distracted by lashing out at women the way he has in the past.\u201cWe need a strong dose of message discipline out of the White House for the next 20 days,\u201d Mr. Reed said. \u201cIf not, this midterm election becomes a crapshoot.\u201dEmily Cochrane and Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "I\u2019ve Interviewed 300 High Achievers About Their Morning Routines. Here\u2019s What I\u2019ve Learned.", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour morning routine should suit your needs, but there are some habits everyone should try.The choices we make during the first hour or so of our morning often determine what the rest of the day will look like. Will your morning routine grant you a day full of productivity and peace of mind? Or will you be looking at an eight-hour stretch of haphazard work?Here are some of the most common morning routines I\u2019ve found among successful people.While the majority of the people I\u2019ve interviewed tend to get up early \u2014 the average wake-up time for everyone I\u2019ve talked to is 6:27 a.m. \u2014 successful people like to experiment to find the sweet spot that works for them.For many of us, the time we wake up depends almost entirely on when we need to be at work, school or elsewhere. This often means waking up as late as possible to maximize sleep time, with the only goal being to make it out of the door on time to avoid being late for wherever we need to be first thing. But experimenting with your wake-up time gives you the space you need to enjoy your mornings.Most successful people carve out time in their morning to commit to things that make them feel relaxed, energized and motivated. That can mean working out, reading, meditating or just spending time with your loved ones.Your morning routine helps to ground you, and using it thoughtfully will help to set the tone for the rest of your day.Marie Kondo, the organizing consultant and author of \u201cThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up,\u201d told me that when she wakes up in the morning she immediately opens the windows to let in fresh air, a practice she has done since she was a child. She also purifies the house by burning incense and, needless to say, she tidies her house before leaving for the day.Breaking news, I know. But stick with me.While it might not always be possible to keep your full morning routine in place when you\u2019re away from home, it is possible to have a travel-ready routine that is always there when you need it. If you\u2019re staying with family, instead of heading to the local gym for a couple of hours in the morning, consider going for a short jog around the block instead. If you\u2019re stuck in a hotel room with few options for breakfast, consider finding the closest grocery store to piece together something loosely resembling your favorite at-home breakfast.Nearly everyone I\u2019ve talked to said they don\u2019t consider one, two or even three missed days of their morning routine a failure, so long as they get back to it as soon as they can. They recognize that sometimes they\u2019ll miss their routine, and that\u2019s O.K.Jerry Seinfeld has a theory of habit creation that requires a person not to \u201cbreak the chain.\u201d The idea is that if there\u2019s a certain task you want to do every day, you can keep yourself accountable by putting a red \u201cX\u201d over every day you complete this task on a large wall calendar. Soon you\u2019ll have created a chain. Your only job then is not to break it.While I\u2019m a fan of Mr. Seinfeld\u2019s theory, it doesn\u2019t allow for occasional, yet inevitable, failures. If it works for you, great! March on keeping that chain alive. But it\u2019s important to keep in mind that life happens and sometimes you simply won\u2019t be able to stick with your morning routine. It happens, and that\u2019s fine. Reflect on it, then forget it and move on.\u201cI give myself a break and take the longer view of what\u2019s happening,\u201d said Kevin Cleary, the chief executive of Clif Bar & Company. \u201cIf I can\u2019t do my workout later in the day, I\u2019ll tell myself I\u2019ll just pick it up tomorrow or the next day. Six months from now, my body or I won\u2019t know that I missed a day.\u201d\u201cIf you think about your goals and they\u2019re reasonable and attainable, then there are actually a lot of benefits to trying to sell yourself a narrative that you\u2019re not fully buying,\u201d said Meredith Shirey, a marriage and family therapist.The key, Ms. Shirey said, is to be aware of your negative feelings, but make the effort to move beyond them \u2014 even if you\u2019re faking it.\u201cYou can acknowledge negative feelings, but it doesn\u2019t mean you have to sit in them,\u201d she said.Just trust that, eventually, you\u2019ll make it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Business Executives Become Reluctant Statesmen", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookWithout a strong stance from Washington to give them cover, top executives have been on their own dealing with Saudi Arabia, a country that has shown itself capable of holding a grudge.How can we get out of this?That was the question repeatedly asked during a series of phone calls over the weekend by the biggest names in finance \u2014 Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, Larry Fink of BlackRock and Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone \u2014 about how they could extricate themselves from a conference in Saudi Arabia they were scheduled attend next week. The three executives considered their options, according to four people briefed on the conversations. Could they pressure Saudi Arabia to postpone the conference? That would be the best outcome, they figured. Would the collective threat of all three of them canceling their plans be enough? Or could they persuade the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, to publicly declare he would not attend? Or could he make his appearance conditional on new information emerging that would support the kingdom\u2019s denial of any involvement in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance? That would give them cover to pull out.But those conversations represent a new reality for business leaders under the presidency of Donald J. Trump. How a conference known as the Davos in the Desert turned into a crucible for these executives and others demonstrates the curious change the world has seen under a businessman president: America\u2019s moral compass being set by the C-suite, rather than the Oval Office.In the last week, businesses have faced perhaps their thorniest conundrum, caught between a global outcry, a vacuum of leadership from Washington and a country with a long memory. Saudi Arabia and its oil riches could represent one of the greatest untapped financial resources of the next generation \u2014 potentially trillions of dollars in capital to invest and billions more in related fees. But many companies have now staked themselves to moral positions: Mr. Fink, for example, said earlier this year that he planned to demand that companies he invests in \u201cserve a social purpose.\u201dThey also fear retribution from Saudi Arabia, which has shown a penchant for holding grudges.One talking point among some executives has been Citigroup\u2019s experience in Saudi Arabia. For decades, the bank had a joint venture with the Saudi government, Saudi American Bank. But after the Sept. 11 terror attacks, and a lawsuit by 9/11 victims against Saudi American Bank, Citi decided to sell its stake. The government was furious and made its feeling clear: Several years later, when Citi sought a license to do business in the kingdom, it found the gates closed. It took years of lobbying and trips to Riyadh before Citi gained the license last year.Despite pleas from corporate leaders for help, Mr. Trump continued to instruct Mr. Mnuchin to attend the conference \u2014 while also saying that he would consider \u201cpunishing\u201d the country if it was found to have killed Mr. Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia\u2019s combative posture \u2014 it said it would \u201crespond to any measure against it with an even stronger measure\u201d \u2014 left business leaders worried that their companies could become targets.And many chief executives took notice of the vindictive nature of the Saudi response to the criticism from Canada this summer over Saudi Arabia\u2019s arrest of human rights activists: The kingdom instructed its investment mangers to start dumping its stakes in shares of Canadian companies, even if the sales would result in losses.Last week, as Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance drew headlines, companies began pulling out of the Saudi conference, known as the Future Investment Initiative. The New York Times and CNN pulled out as media partners. Late Thursday, Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, said he would not attend. His decision was perhaps the most courageous: His company had received a $3.5 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund in 2016 and one of his own board members is the head of the fund, which was putting on the conference.I also had to make my own hard decision. I was scheduled to moderate several panels, like I have done at other conferences. But I chose to end my participation because, quite simply, it was the right thing to do. There was no guarantee that I would have the opportunity to ask tough questions of people in power about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, and my participation, I feared, would be perceived as an endorsement of the kingdom rather than a journalistic enterprise.So the exodus had already begun before the three financial titans began strategizing over the weekend. In a series of phone calls, Mr. Dimon, Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Fink scrambled to find a way to gracefully exit the conference \u2014 or at least put it off, according to the people briefed on the conversations. Those people spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the business and political sensitivity of the discussions.Mr. Fink called Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the chief executive of the Saudi Public Investment Fund and Uber board member, and encouraged him to delay the conference, according to people familiar with the conversation. The event would bring unwanted attention on the kingdom and the many companies that have tried to work with the country, Mr. Fink told him, overshadowing any chance of it serving as a positive catalyst for further investment. Mr. Schwarzman called Mr. Mnuchin, pressing him to cancel his trip or to work with the Saudis to postpone the conference, according to people familiar with the phone call. Neither conversation ended with a solution.By Sunday night, Mr. Dimon decided he could not wait for more conference-call diplomacy: He declared he was out, the people said. Mr. Fink and Mr. Schwarzman decided to give the Saudis one more chance: If the conference was not postponed by 6 a.m. Monday, they would withdraw from the event.At 6 a.m., the event was still on, and the three biggest names in finance were out.The decisions that business leaders have made in the past week are laudable \u2014 Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s in particular, because of Uber\u2019s direct ties to the kingdom. And the departures of Mr. Fink, Mr. Dimon and Mr. Schwarzman \u2014 despite the role of public pressure \u2014 opened the door for more companies to walk out.To be sure, it\u2019s hard to imagine companies pulling up stakes entirely in Saudi Arabia or some other country because of moral considerations. But even gestures like pulling out of a conference go some small way toward demonstrating American values. Over the coming weeks, there almost certainly will be more pressure for companies to distance themselves from the kingdom. Executives better get used to their new role as de facto diplomats.

{"Headline": "Pensions Get Bolder in Challenging Private Equity on Investments\u2019 Human Cost", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrivate equity firms and public pension funds have long had a symbiotic relationship: The funds supply the firms with billions of dollars to invest, and the firms deliver double-digit returns that help the funds support retired public servants.Now, pension leaders are showing a new willingness to confront private equity over the human impact of its investments.Pension officials said the moves were sound investment decisions that were not driven by politics. Major layoffs at companies owned by private equity firms can hurt local economies, where pensions are broadly invested. A harassment scandal could damage a private equity firm\u2019s reputation and, by extension, a pension fund\u2019s investment.Pensions have long shunned investments unpopular with the people they represent, often in broad categories like guns and fossil fuels. But in recent years, pension holders\u2019 concerns have gotten more specific, and calls for the funds to take stands have increased.\u201cWe are having more contact with the public about these types of issues,\u201d said Adam Liebtag, the acting chairman of the New Jersey State Investment Council. \u201cThey are paying closer attention. They are following the money.\u201dNew Jersey is a hotbed for social concerns over pension investments. In addition to voting to more closely monitor firms under the moratorium on foreclosures in Puerto Rico, the state recently pulled money out of a private equity firm that had acquired a so-called payday lender.\u201cIt\u2019s a balancing act every time these situations arise,\u201d Mr. Liebtag said.The attitudes expressed by private equity investors are also attracting scrutiny.In June, John Russell, vice chairman of the Oregon Investment Council, said sexist remarks that David Bonderman, a TPG founder, had made in his capacity as an Uber board member were \u201cpart of the behavior that basically crippled the brand.\u201dA TPG spokesman said in a statement that the firm was \u201ccommitted to being a leader in advancing diversity and inclusion in the industry.\u201dToday, about 35 percent of private equity\u2019s money comes from public pensions, according to Preqin, a data firm.Not wanting to alienate their funding sources further, private equity firms seem willing to concede on social issues, pension experts say.\u201cThe last thing private equity wants to do is screw this up,\u201d said Ashby Monk, executive director of the Stanford Global Projects Center, which focuses on financial research.The shift coincides with a growing awareness among workers that they can exert influence through public pension boards, where many of the members making investment decisions represent labor unions.\u201cWorkers don\u2019t want their pension money invested in ways that hurt other workers,\u201d said Sarah Bloom Raskin, a fellow at Duke University and a deputy Treasury secretary in the Obama administration.\u201cNo one wants to be invested in their own decline,\u201d she said.The collapse of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us has earned private equity particularly widespread criticism. The former owners had loaded the retailer up with $5 billion in debt, which helped push it into bankruptcy in September 2017.The workers said they were unable to get through to the private equity firms, so they switched tack. Over the next three months, they traveled to investment meetings of 14 pension funds in 12 states.The employees were organized by the activist groups Rise Up Retail and the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, which was started last year.\u201cThere is a well-developed ecosystem of groups that focus on the practices of public companies,\u201d said Jim Baker, the Stakeholder Project\u2019s executive director. \u201cBut it\u2019s a limited field around private equity.\u201dThe Stakeholder Project, which is partly financed by labor unions, has focused on private equity\u2019s ownership of for-profit colleges, bail bond companies and the private prison industry. The group argued that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us workers deserved a portion of the financing and management fees the private equity firms collected from the retailer.The workers scored a big victory in Minnesota when Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, and the chairman of the state pension board led the effort to suspend further investments with K.K.R. in June.In Washington State, pension officials publicly questioned a top K.K.R. executive, asking if anyone had lost his or her job at the firm over the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy or had gotten a cut in pay. One pension board member suggested that the firm had a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to set up a fund to help the workers. The K.K.R. executive, pointing out that the firm had lost money in the bankruptcy, apologized to the pension board.Michelle Perez of Vancouver, Wash., was among those laid off when Toys \u201cR\u201d Us closed. Ms. Perez, 28, said she had spoken to officials with pension funds about the difficulty she faced as a single mother trying to find a new job, without severance to provide any cushion.\u201cWe are getting listened to,\u201d she said.The toy store workers also made their case to pension funds that invest with Bain.By late summer, their efforts had begun to bear fruit: K.K.R. and Bain agreed to contribute up to $20 million between them to a hardship fund for the workers, although the final amount and terms had not been set, according to people briefed on the matter. Both firms declined to comment.Last month, Minnesota lifted the suspension on future K.K.R. investments after learning that the firm had agreed to contribute to the hardship fund.Vornado has not indicated that it planned to participate, according to the workers\u2019 group. The firm did not respond to requests for comment.The toy store workers are still pushing to recoup all of the $75 million they are owed in severance. Lately, they have been urging New Jersey to put pressure on Solus Alternative Asset Management, which owns some of the failed retailer\u2019s debt. New Jersey has $300 million invested with Solus.Solus has indicated that it has no plans to contribute to the fund, saying in a letter to investors that the stakeholders group was trying to \u201cextort\u201d investment firms.In a statement, Solus said it was working to revive the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us brand \u201cin a way that we hope will provide sustainable employment for workers in the future.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "N.J. Governor Orders Inquiry Into Hiring of Top Official Accused of Sexual Assault", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEWARK \u2014 Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey on Monday worked to quell the controversy engulfing his administration after a woman who accused a top official of sexual assault faulted the administration\u2019s response, saying \u201cI have received no justice,\u201d while Democrats in the Legislature demanded \u201ca full accounting of what occurred.\u201dIn a 33-minute news conference, a visibly upset Mr. Murphy said he was sick to his stomach after learning about the allegation and ordered an investigation into his administration\u2019s hiring of Albert J. Alvarez, the official accused of sexual assault by Katie Brennan, a volunteer for Mr. Murphy\u2019s campaign.The investigation will focus on why Mr. Alvarez was hired after members of Mr. Murphy\u2019s transition team were made aware of the allegation. The governor also said he was directing the state\u2019s Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action office to review how allegations of sexual misconduct are handled.Ms. Brennan, 31, made her first public statements on the matter on Sunday, calling for major changes to how New Jersey deals with allegations of sexual assault.\u201cI feel awful for Katie,\u201d the governor said at a news conference. \u201cNobody deserves this. She\u2019s been screaming out for help and she didn\u2019t get it. And whether it\u2019s reviewing the laws, the policies, who did what when, criminal justice reform, we\u2019re just not good enough.\u201dBut as he departs on a nine-day trade mission to Germany and Israel, his first overseas trip as governor, Mr. Murphy leaves behind a state capital in New Jersey roiled by Ms. Brennan\u2019s accusations.Top Democratic leaders have been openly critical of the administration, and Republican leaders are calling for a full-scale legislative investigation.Loretta Weinberg, the Senate majority leader, announced that she would move to form a legislative committee to investigate how sexual assault allegations are handled by law enforcement agencies, the criminal justice system and state government.\u201cThere is no doubt that the system failed Ms. Brennan, and that the failures occurred at every level,\u201d said Ms. Weinberg in a statement.Mr. Murphy said Peter G. Verniero, a former justice on the New Jersey Supreme Court who now works for a law firm, will oversee the investigation. The governor said he planned to speak with Ms. Brennan later on Monday.\u201cSeveral senior level members of the Murphy administration were aware of my assault and failed to take meaningful action,\u201d said Ms. Brennan, the chief of staff at the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency. She called the actions of several members of Mr. Murphy\u2019s staff \u201cunacceptable.\u201dIn response, Mr. Murphy and his wife, Tammy, issued their own lengthy statement, saying that they believed the administration had handled the accusations appropriately. But they also said that his transition team had made a mistake in hiring Mr. Alvarez, who recently abruptly resigned as the chief of staff at the Schools Development Authority, which deals with school construction.\u201cI wish we hadn\u2019t made the hire in transition, period,\u201d Mr. Murphy told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m sick to my stomach once I heard what happened.\u201dThe governor maintained that he had not been aware of Ms. Brennan\u2019s allegation until Oct. 2, when The Wall Street Journal provided information about its findings to his office. But Mr. Murphy said that he believed his administration had handled the allegation appropriately once it was brought to the attention of his chief counsel, Matt Platkin, in March.\u201cThese processes, within government at least, are confidential and treated confidentially,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s for a reason, to make sure that there\u2019s a fairness associated with it. That you\u2019re not, even inadvertently, putting your hand on the scale. I believe in this case it obviously was followed because we did not hear about it until October 2nd.\u201dIn The Wall Street Journal article, Mr. Alvarez, through a lawyer, denied Ms. Brennan\u2019s allegation. He did not respond to several phone calls. Ms. Brennan, who lives in Jersey City, had originally brought her allegation to the Hudson County district attorney\u2019s office, which declined to bring charges.On Monday, the state attorney general\u2019s office announced that it had directed the Middlesex County district attorney to review the case file after officials said that Esther Suarez, the Hudson County prosecutor, examined it this month and realized that she knew both parties.The attorney general\u2019s office said it made the decision \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d to avoid any suggestion of a conflict of interest.Ms. Brennan, in her statement, called for changes in how New Jersey handles sexual assault allegations, including eliminating the statute of limitations on civil action related to sexual assault.\u201cI decided to come forward because I know that Al Alvarez, and all perpetrators, must be held accountable, must never rape again, and the justice system needs a complete change with regard to sexual violence,\u201d Ms. Brennan said.Ms. Brennan described the alleged assault in graphic detail in the Journal article, which she said occurred last April, during Mr. Murphy\u2019s campaign. At the time, she was not involved in the campaign, while Mr. Alvarez was the campaign\u2019s director for Latino outreach.She was eventually able to kick Mr. Alvarez off and escape, locking herself in the bathroom.Ms. Brennan said she spent \u201can entire year pursuing a criminal case before hitting a dead end.\u201dShe also made an attempt to address the matter directly with Mr. Murphy, sending him an email asking to discuss a \u201csensitive manner\u201d that had occurred during the campaign, though she did not include any mention of her allegation. In response, he wrote back stating that \u201cwe are on it\u201d and instructing his campaign counsel, Jonathan Berkon, to follow up.Last week, as reports emerged about the allegation against Mr. Alvarez, Republicans in the State Legislature began calling for legislative hearings into hiring practices by the Murphy administration. Democratic lawmakers expressed concern over the allegation, but have not yet called for hearings.\u201cKnowledge of the incident by the transition should have triggered significantly greater scrutiny before the alleged assailant was hired,\u201d Mr. Malinowski said. \u201cThat prosecutors chose not to pursue criminal charges should not have settled the matter, and it let too many involved look the other way.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Tesla Could Do Better Than James Murdoch for Chairman", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsTesla can find a better chairman than James Murdoch.Replacing Mr. Musk with an independent chair is required as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which alleged that he made false and misleading statements via Twitter about a potential buyout of the company.Mr. Murdoch is one of only three Tesla directors who safely qualify as independent: The others have too much history with Mr. Musk. Mr. Murdoch also has experience as an executive at big public companies like 21st Century Fox. True, he worked alongside his tycoon father, Rupert \u2014 but at least he knows how to deal with an entrenched shareholder-executive.Mr. Murdoch has no background in cars, though. And he had to step down as executive chairman of News International in 2011 after a phone-hacking scandal.Moreover, Mr. Musk\u2019s latest tweet reinforces how neither Mr. Murdoch nor the rest of the board has yet proved able to rein him in. Publicly commenting on the chairman search gives the impression that the chief executive is playing a central role, when he should have little to no say. Another part of the S.E.C. deal requires the board to set up \u201cadditional controls and procedures\u201d to oversee Mr. Musk\u2019s communications.To date, directors have either supported Mr. Musk \u2014 as they did after he rejected the initial settlement offered by the S.E.C. \u2014 or remained silent about his controversial remarks. They have not obviously curbed his penchant for going public with unrealistic business targets, either.Aside from tough love for Mr. Musk, improving investor relations, mass production and corporate finance are all on Tesla\u2019s to-do list. That all makes appointing a respected outsider a better option than Mr. Murdoch. That could be former Ford Motor boss Alan Mulally, erstwhile Boeing chief executive Jim McNerney or even a hard-nosed finance type like the Goldman Sachs and White House alum Gary Cohn.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Andrew Gillum, a Florida Insider Running as a Progressive Outsider", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 City Hall never did seem big enough for Andrew Gillum.It was November 2014 \u2014 Mr. Gillum\u2019s swearing-in as mayor of Tallahassee \u2014 and typical accommodations would not do. Traditionally, the city had inaugurated its new government quietly, in its municipal chambers. But Mr. Gillum, then 35, wanted a party. He wanted, colleagues groused, to be seen making a speech.And seen he was.\u201cI won\u2019t always get it right, but I\u2019ll be honest,\u201d Mr. Gillum said in an outdoor address, as a constellation of lobbyists, friends and lobbyist-friends at the city\u2019s tailgate-style festival looked on \u2014 their faith and investment in him rewarded. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some good times ahead, y\u2019all.\u201dFour years and one long-shot campaign later, this has proved true for Mr. Gillum. With his upset victory in the Democratic primary for governor in August, Mr. Gillum, 39, has continued on a glide path to the party\u2019s upper reaches that began about a mile down the road, as a student government leader at Florida A&M University, before he was old enough to drink. He may be elected the first black governor of the nation\u2019s largest swing state in November, as his race against former Representative Ron DeSantis, a Trump acolyte who just turned 40, emerges as a national proxy for the parties\u2019 dueling futures.Mr. Gillum\u2019s admirers see in him a hybrid of Bernie Sanders and Barack Obama \u2014 an authentic progressive who supports higher corporate taxes and greater gun control, calls for the impeachment of President Trump and Medicare for all, and can inspire young and minority voters in a state that last elected a Democratic governor in 1994. And in recent days, he has been ubiquitous, in his city and on television, as he managed the fallout from Hurricane Michael, at one point commandeering a chain saw himself to help clear tree debris.Yet an examination of Mr. Gillum\u2019s record lays bare the central contradiction of his political life: Self-styled as an activist-minded populist, with a lunch-pail upbringing in south Miami-Dade County, he is also an avatar of the capital city he runs \u2014 a town powered by ambition, horse-trading and alliances with well-placed power players.One top campaign adviser \u2014 Sean Pittman, a close friend and mentor whom Mr. Gillum met as a student at Florida A&M \u2014 is also one of the city\u2019s subcontracted lobbyists. Another senior strategist, Sharon Lettman-Hicks, also a confidante since college, paid the mayor a salary of $71,680 in 2017 to advise her boutique public-relations consulting firm, though he spent virtually all of his non-mayoral time running for governor. Until recently, Ms. Lettman-Hicks also served as the landlord of his campaign headquarters, collecting $38,087.50 in rent from March 2017 through August of this year, according to campaign finance records.Mr. Gillum, in an interview, said he did not see these relationships or others with lobbyists as problematic. Rather, he has framed his own career arc as a triumph of within-the-system maneuvering, his approach summed up in a stock line to campaign audiences: \u201cIf you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu.\u201dIn ensuring he has had a seat, for the better part of two decades now, Mr. Gillum has earned the label that most elected leaders strain to avoid: career politician. He won election to the Tallahassee city commission at age 23 and has never left public office. Though the job of mayor is largely ceremonial, representing one of five votes on the commission, Mr. Gillum has engendered fierce loyalty among working-class constituents for his emphasis on criminal justice and education for low-income students. He has also tended to relationships with a more affluent set, long before attracting progressive billionaires like Tom Steyer and George Soros to his cause.\u201cDoes he have friends who are lobbyists? You bet,\u201d said Allan Katz, a former city commissioner who served with Mr. Gillum and later became Mr. Obama\u2019s ambassador to Portugal. \u201cDid I have friends who were lobbyists? You bet.\u201dMr. Gillum has insisted that investigators told him he is not their target, and the inquiry has yet to produce any indictments. But subpoenaed documents revealed that Mr. Gillum took two personal trips in 2016 with Mr. Corey: one to Costa Rica with a top Gillum adviser, Mr. Pittman, and another to New York with Mr. Gillum\u2019s younger brother and the agents. Mr. Gillum has said he paid his own way for most of the travel, with his brother treating him to a Broadway performance of \u201cHamilton\u201d and a hotel stay. Both trips are under investigation by Florida\u2019s state ethics commission. Mr. Gillum\u2019s younger brother, Marcus, declined to comment, and a lawyer for Mr. Corey declined to provide further case details.Mr. Gillum\u2019s defenders have said any whiff of impropriety is inconsistent with the man, and the city, they know.\u201cThere is no corruption in the city of Tallahassee,\u201d Curtis Richardson, the city\u2019s mayor pro tempore, said in an interview. (Later, he seemed to hedge slightly: \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s systemic corruption, and multiple individuals are involved, and it\u2019s from the top down. It\u2019s not that at all.\u201d)Mr. Katz, the former commissioner, said Mr. Gillum had been too ambitious, for too long, to behave recklessly. \u201cHe always was looking for a political future for himself and was therefore, I think, extremely careful,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cBut all of us who\u2019ve been involved in politics sometimes wind up in the wrong room with the wrong guy.\u201dMr. Gillum has chafed most at the labels applied to him as the investigation churns, which he believes fail to capture the totality of the affair. \u201cYou only put people in characters: \u2018lobbyist and mayor,\u2019\u201d the mayor said of the lobbyist matter during a 45-minute interview at a local coffee shop. \u201cI have a very easy time saying no to friends.\u201d\u201cWhat about me makes you think that it\u2019s appropriate?\u201d he said. \u201cWhat is in the atmosphere that would suggest that I\u2019m the right person?\u201dThe other children called him \u201cThe Principal.\u201d It was not necessarily a compliment.From an early age, Mr. Gillum had always been the serious one, politically minded enough to make C-Span his appointment viewing in middle school, warming to a California congresswoman, Maxine Waters, who he long assumed was his representative because she, too, was black.At Gainesville High School, Mr. Gillum, the fifth of seven children of a bus driver and a construction worker, became vice president of the student body, standing out as one of two African-American boys in advanced placement classes.The \u201cprincipal\u201d nickname owed to his hyper-diligence in his elected role. \u201cWhen the teacher asked, \u2018What are we doing at this meeting today?\u2019 the others said, \u2018Well, Andrew has the agenda,\u2019\u201d said Cynthia Moore Chestnut, a former state representative and the mother of Mr. Gillum\u2019s best friend in high school.Once at Florida A&M, Mr. Gillum quickly announced himself as a canny organizer, working on the Senate campaign of Willie Logan and sidling up to several mentors across the state\u2019s black political establishment. In one early crusade, he helped introduce a \u201cMr. FAMU\u201d competition to complement a popular \u201cMiss FAMU\u201d pageant for women. And working with two state legislators in 2000, Mr. Gillum orchestrated a student march on the governor\u2019s office in response to then-Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s effort to turn back racial preferences in public university admissions.\u201cHe was preparing himself then,\u201d said one of the former legislators, Anthony C. Hill, then a state representative.Peers seemed to agree. \u201cAndrew Gillum is merely positioning himself for a future career as a Democrat politician,\u201d a recent Florida A&M alumnus wrote to Mr. Bush in 2002, according to email archives released when Mr. Bush ran for president, urging him to speak at the school\u2019s graduation over the protests of Mr. Gillum, the student body president. (Mr. Bush did not speak in the end.)Before graduating, Mr. Gillum was already eyeing an open seat on Tallahassee\u2019s city commission, believing he could galvanize a new bloc of student voters often disconnected from the civic arcana of the city itself. Some supporters were skeptical.\u201cI told him, \u2018Andrew, you\u2019re not from Tallahassee, you\u2019re from Gainesville,\u2019\u201d Mr. Hill remembered. \u201cHe said, \u2018Yeah, but I think I can get the students behind me.\u2019\u201dDespite meager fund-raising, he prevailed in a runoff election, moving immediately to expand his base of support. Another commissioner, Gil Ziffer, recalled an early speech from Mr. Gillum before a nearly all-white political club. He won the crowd by reciting advice he said his father had given him about the \u201cfive B\u2019s\u201d of public speaking, especially to white audiences: \u201cBe brief, brother. Be brief.\u201dMr. Gillum also kept a foothold outside of City Hall, working with other young elected officials nationally as a leader of People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group.He developed a reputation for seeing around corners politically. Mr. Gillum was an early supporter of Mr. Obama, urging fellow commissioners to keep their powder dry in the 2008 contest against Hillary Clinton. Mr. Katz, who heeded Mr. Gillum\u2019s advice, joined him in South Carolina on the state\u2019s primary night, where they encountered the future president. \u201cHe knew Andrew right away,\u201d Mr. Katz said. \u201cObama looked at him with a big smile and said, \u2018Andrew, how\u2019s my young commissioner doing?\u2019\u201dWhen Mrs. Clinton ran again, Mr. Gillum endeared himself to her team, too, becoming a top Florida surrogate and securing a place on a leaked list of about 40 potential running mates, as he has mentioned often during the campaign. But he did rebuff one request before the state\u2019s 2016 primary, according to a former Clinton aide: to attack Mr. Sanders directly. The decision proved foresighted; Mr. Sanders\u2019s endorsement helped elevate Mr. Gillum in his own primary for governor this year.As mayor, Mr. Gillum\u2019s tenure has been defined often by the less glamorous trials of local government. He has confronted devastating storms \u2014 Hurricane Hermine in 2016 and Hurricane Michael last week \u2014 that left thousands of residents without power, taking care recently to remain ever-visible in the recovery efforts and document his doings in social media posts and cable news appearances.He has also faced criticism at times for crime in Tallahassee, the biggest city in Leon County, which has the highest crime rate in the state. There were 22 murders in the county last year. Colleagues say the perception is unfair to Mr. Gillum, who moved to hire dozens of new police officers as concern grew.His platform for governor has been loftier: raise the corporate tax rate, significantly boost public school funding, legalize marijuana, repeal the \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d self-defense law that has long been contentious in the state.But much of his agenda would be dictated by the pliability of the legislature, which is likely to remain under Republican control, making many of his promises difficult to honor on his own.The trouble with Tallahassee \u2014 with state capitals generally, Mr. Gillum suggests \u2014 is that people tend to assume the worst. History has given them ample reason.\u201cClearly I live in the capital city, and there are a lot of lawyer-lobbyist people,\u201d Mr. Gillum said in the interview. He argued that it was a mistake to conflate his city \u2014 a community of students, families and a striking number of mattress stores \u2014 with the political excesses of state government.But his case is complicated by recent events. Mr. Gillum\u2019s predecessor as mayor was investigated by the F.B.I. but never charged. So was a recent school district superintendent, in a separate F.B.I. inquiry, also without a charge.The city does little to discourage the smoke-filled caricature of white-collar swampiness. At its main power lunch spot, Andrew\u2019s (no relation), across from the Capitol, the sweet potato waffle fries are named for a city commissioner under investigation for an alleged pay-to-play scheme. The muses for the cheeseburger and key lime pie were recently found to be having an affair.\u201cThere are no secrets in Tallahassee,\u201d said Ed Narain, a former state representative.But there is an F.B.I. inquiry, and a mayor eager to protect his own name. Mr. Gillum supported posting online the city records subpoenaed by investigators. He shares liberally on Facebook, with direct-to-the-people messages about his work. He is raising three children with his wife, R. Jai, another A&M alum, in the city he oversees.\u201cThere\u2019s no difference between his public life and his private life,\u201d his pastor, the Rev. Julius H. McAllister Jr., said. \u201cIt\u2019s intertwined.\u201dAt times, though, Mr. Gillum has stood accused of blurring lines that others assumed were clear.His office spent about $5,000 in taxpayer dollars in 2016 to buy software from a Democratic Party vendor to send political emails, an improper purchase that Mr. Gillum defended until being forced last year to pay the city back and apologize.He voted in 2013 to give Mr. Corey, his college friend-turned-lobbyist, over $2 million in public funds to redevelop an old power plant into a high-end restaurant, after a city attorney ruled that having the mayor vote on a contract for Mr. Corey, his former campaign treasurer, did not constitute a conflict of interest.And Mr. Gillum signed off last month on extending a contract for the city\u2019s legislative lobbyist, who retains Mr. Pittman, the top campaign adviser, as a subcontracted lobbyist. Mr. Gillum said Mr. Pittman had not spoken to him about the extension.Mr. Pittman also joined Mr. Gillum and Mr. Corey on the 2016 trip to Costa Rica that is now under state ethics investigation. (Mr. Pittman was an early investor in Mr. Corey\u2019s restaurant.) Mr. Gillum \u2014 who earned $79,176 as mayor last year, in addition to his more than $71,000 in consulting income \u2014 has said he and his wife paid for their share of a $1,400-a-night villa in cash; as evidence to ethics investigators, he provided a bank statement showing a $400 withdrawal before their departure. (An attorney for Mr. Corey, who won the villa at a charity auction, said his client was not reimbursed.)In an interview, Mr. Pittman said that he and the mayor were \u201cno different from any other family friends who have been close for decades.\u201d\u201cWhen you\u2019re a public figure, there are people who look for reasons to negatively impact your success,\u201d Mr. Pittman said, calling his bond with Mr. Gillum \u201ca beautiful relationship and not one that I think either one of us would allow someone to try to cheapen.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.At a rally last month in Broward County, waylaid briefly by a sun shower, Mr. Gillum called off local organizers who had been fussing with a banner in the downpour. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a banner,\u201d he said, gesturing to the mob surrounding him beneath an overhang. \u201cWe got a banner right here.\u201dHe had just one three-word directive through the elements: \u201cLet\u2019s win, y\u2019all.\u201dSusan Beachy and Kitty Bennett contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Embraces Foreign Aid to Counter China\u2019s Global Influence", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump, seeking to counter China\u2019s growing geopolitical influence, is embracing a major expansion of foreign aid that will bankroll infrastructure projects in Africa, Asia and the Americas \u2014 throwing his support behind an initiative he once sought to scuttle.Now, Mr. Trump wants to fight fire with fire.\u201cI\u2019ve changed, and I think he\u2019s changed, and it is all about China,\u201d said Representative Ted Yoho, Republican of Florida, who helped sell the plan to other conservative Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus, which has historically opposed foreign aid programs.\u201cMy whole impetus in running for Congress in the first place was to get rid of foreign aid. It was my thing,\u201d said Mr. Yoho, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. \u201cBut if we can reformulate and modernize it, yeah, I have no problem with that. There are people who want to do this for humanitarian aid, fine. There are people like me who want to do this for national security, like me, fine.\u201dEvery Asian country now trades more with China than with the United States, often by a factor of two to one. Here\u2019s how the outlines of the rivalry are defining the future of the continent.China\u2019s biggest investments are targeted to countries, like Pakistan and Nigeria, with a goal of expanding Beijing\u2019s geopolitical power and gaining access to natural resources like minerals and oil. But it is also spending billions on projects in smaller countries that are less likely to turn a monetary or political profit. Last month, President Xi Jinping said China would provide $60 billion in financial support to Africa, including credit lines, grants and investment financing.The investments have raised concerns that poor and emerging nations like Djibouti and Sri Lanka could be increasingly beholden to China, which can seize local assets if countries default on loans.\u201cThe whole point of China\u2019s activity is building things no one else wanted to build \u2014 rail lines between African countries that hate each other, roads in bad terrain, power plants that are never going to make any money,\u201d said Derek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who studies the Chinese and Indian economies.\u201cIf a country can\u2019t pay, they will take assets they want,\u201d he added. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t setting a debt trap. This is about expanding their reach and exercising passive power.\u201dThe United States\u2019 initiative is far less ambitious. But it \u201callows us, at least, to compete,\u201d said Tom Hart, North America executive director of ONE, the development nonprofit that the musician Bono helped found.The new $60 billion aid program was tucked into a five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration and its passage was the product of a quiet, bipartisan effort. It included ONE, the Brookings Institution, conservative House members like Mr. Yoho and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. It was led by Ray Washburne, the president of O.P.I.C. and a top Republican fund-raiser from Texas.O.P.I.C., like most other foreign development agencies, has come under heavy fire from the right, which has argued that such assistance is a waste of federal resources and a form of corporate welfare. During President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, the Republican-controlled House balked at reauthorizing the agency.During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to \u201cstop sending aid to countries that hate us.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m astonished, to be honest. I still can\u2019t believe we got it done,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this since 2015. It is basically the same proposal we had under the Obama administration. We rebranded to focus it on China.\u201dThe agency contains new accountability measures and includes reporting requirements to prevent gender discrimination and the use of child labor, but it is otherwise similar to its predecessor.Shortly after being picked as budget director last year, Mick Mulvaney \u2014 with the president\u2019s enthusiastic support \u2014 proposed slashing the State Department\u2019s foreign aid budget by one-third, a plan that zeroed out O.P.I.C.\u2019s budget.Soft power has, however, proved hard to kill.Congressional Republicans rejected Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s cuts. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo fought Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s attempts to claw back $3 billion in foreign aid spending this year, telling Mr. Trump that the cuts would weaken the country\u2019s position in the world and his own standing with the department\u2019s pro-foreign-aid career staff, according to two administration officials with knowledge of the exchanges.In the end, Mr. Yoho sold Mr. Mulvaney on supporting the expansion of the investment fund, arguing that its expansion would probably cost taxpayers nothing.Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, emphasized that the initiative represented a strategic shift. Mr. Trump seems to be learning that the projections of military power alone will not be enough to compete with China, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing what China is doing throughout Africa and South America, especially Venezuela, and people are waking up and realizing we have to have involvement with the countries, not just for a return on investment, but to move them toward a market-based approach,\u201d said Mr. Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is not running for re-election. \u201cSo much of our foreign policy now is focused on trying to check China, especially their nefarious activities.\u201dA bigger question is whether it will do anything to reduce China\u2019s global influence.\u201cI\u2019m pretty skeptical,\u201d Mr. Scissors said. \u201cThe whole concept is that we give more money to big players who make investments in places where they don\u2019t lose money. We\u2019ve finessed the public relations problem. But we aren\u2019t really competing with the Chinese.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Government Is Looking East. Or Is it Heading There?", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe country stands where the spheres of influence of Moscow and Brussels meet. Contributing Opinion WriterTRIESTE, Italy \u2014 I love this place. I don\u2019t know why. I wasn\u2019t born here, I wasn\u2019t raised here, I\u2019ve never lived or run away from here. I didn\u2019t even fall in love here, strolling of an evening in the breathtaking Piazza Unit\u00e0, one of its four sides gazing out to sea.I think I like Trieste because it\u2019s a boundary of geography, the mind and more. Tucked in Italy\u2019s northeastern corner, it\u2019s Latin, Germanic, Slavic. It\u2019s Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Jewish. It\u2019s a place of literature and trade. The south stops here: The Adriatic Sea laps Europe\u2019s shore, then decides it can\u2019t go any further. The north stops here: The Karst plateau is a terrace for the Continent, and over the centuries the people of Vienna visited to enjoy the view. The east stops here: The sighs of Russia have never gone any farther. The west stops here: NATO bases ready to beat back invaders from the Warsaw Pact remain scattered around.Trieste was created by the Hapsburg Empire, which owned little coast. In the early 1700s it was just a large village of fishermen, salters, market gardeners. The empire made it into a port, with a monopoly on imports and exports, privileged levies, soft railway tariffs \u2014 a world that wilted to a close a century ago. Since then, Trieste has been through an awful lot. It was won back by Italy in 1918, then chosen as Fascism\u2019s iconic city. It was occupied by the Nazis in 1943, then taken by the Yugoslav Communists in 1945. In 1947, Trieste was put under Anglo-American military government; only in 1954 was it restored to the Italian state.Today, at long last, it is a prosperous, peaceful European city. The seaport, shipbuilding, coffee and insurance companies and scientific research institutions provide employment for all. But it is a city forever shifting politically, sitting at the sliding fault line of European power. On Aug. 28, Matteo Salvini, leader of the Lega, was in Milan to welcome Hungary\u2019s authoritarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, who proclaimed his host \u201cmy hero.\u201d A few days later, Lega deputies voted to support Budapest in the European Parliament, which was about to take measures against the Hungarian government\u2019s anti-democratic activities. The Italian government\u2019s verbal support of Vladimir Putin of Russia has been frequent and without criticism. In May, Mr. Salvini called Mr. Putin \u201ca leading statesman.\u201d Contacts between Lega and United Russia, Mr. Putin\u2019s party, are intense and continuous: conferences, congresses, meetings. Italy\u2019s European affairs minister, Paolo Savona, is not only a renowned euro-skeptic, he is also anti-German and pro-Russian. In an interview before being appointed, he said: \u201cPutin is a realist. He\u2019s against a Europe that would damage him. And this Europe does.\u201dThe new chairman of the Italian state television company RAI, the journalist Marcello Foa, like all his predecessors, was appointed by the ruling majority. He openly supports Mr. Putin and has often been a guest on RT, the Kremlin-financed television channel, where he defends Moscow on its Ukraine policies and other questions. On TV talk shows, intellectuals who side with the Italian government mention \u201cItaly\u2019s affinity with Russia\u201d and demand the closing of American military bases. And there is no lack of support for Moscow among the opposition\u2019s ranks. Silvio Berlusconi and the Russian president go back a long way, with Mr. Berlusconi often visiting Mr. Putin as well as having Mr. Putin over to his place in Sardinia. For the moment, none of this has been followed up with major foreign policy shifts. Still, Italy\u2019s traditional allies worry. A delegation from the American State Department is expected to pay a quiet visit soon to Rome to find out where Italy will stand in December, when the European Council must decide whether to continue sanctions on Russia over Ukraine. As things stand now, Eastern Europe\u2019s authoritarians and Russia are mentioned, esteemed, admired and defended by Italy\u2019s leaders at every turn. At which point who knows where we will end up?Beppe Severgnini is the editor in chief of Corriere Della Sera\u2019s magazine 7, the author of \u201cLa Bella Figura: A Field Guide to the Italian Mind\u201d and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

But the incident was profoundly disturbing \u2014 as a threat not just to the safety of our family, neighbors, colleagues and friends, but also to the future of American democracy.My family is no stranger to the hostilities of those who reject our philosophy, our politics and our very identity. My father grew up in the shadow of the Nazi regime in Hungary. My grandfather secured papers with false names so that they could survive the onslaught against Budapest\u2019s Jews; he helped many others do the same. After the war, as the Communists took power, my father escaped to London, where he studied at the London School of Economics before embarking on what ultimately became a hugely successful career in finance.But the lessons of his early life never left him. His biggest philanthropic endeavor, the Open Society Foundations, played a leading role in supporting the transition from Communism to more democratic societies in parts of the former Soviet Union and then expanded to protect democratic practices in existing democracies. My father acknowledges that his philanthropic work, while nonpartisan, is \u201cpolitical\u201d in a broad sense: It seeks to support those who promote societies where everyone has a voice.There is a long list of people who find that proposition unacceptable, and my father has faced plenty of attacks along the way, many dripping with the poison of anti-Semitism.But something changed in 2016. Before that, the vitriol he faced was largely confined to the extremist fringes, among white supremacists and nationalists who sought to undermine the very foundations of democracy.In Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n launched an anti-Semitic poster campaign falsely accusing my father of wanting to flood Hungary with migrants. This included plastering my father\u2019s face onto the floor of trams in Budapest so that people would walk on it, all to serve Mr. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s political agenda.Now we have attempted bomb attacks. While the responsibility lies with the individual or individuals who sent these lethal devices to my family home and Mr. Obama\u2019s and Ms. Clinton\u2019s offices, I cannot see it divorced from the new normal of political demonization that plagues us today.I am under no illusion that the hatred directed at us is unique. There are too many people in the United States and around the world who have felt the force of this malign spirit. It is now all too \u201cnormal\u201d that people who speak their minds are routinely subjected to personal hostility, hateful messages on social media and death threats.It is also all too normal that organizations doing important pro-democracy work face existential threats simply because they accept support from the foundations my father started. And all too normal that political leaders who swear an oath of office to protect all citizens instead pursue politics of division and hate. We are far removed from the days when Senator John McCain rebuffed his own supporters during the 2008 election to patriotically defend his opponent, Mr. Obama \u2014 all because he believed that the health of our democracy was more important than his personal political gain.We must find our way to a new political discourse that shuns the demonization of all political opponents. A first step would be to cast our ballots to reject those politicians cynically responsible for undermining the institutions of our democracy. And we must do it now, before it is too late.Alexander Soros is the deputy chairman of the Open Society Foundations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How Trump Should Address Unfair Trade With China ", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorrecting currency misalignment, not imposing tariffs, should be his priority.Dr. Scott is an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a research organization.The president\u2019s tariff approach ignores a more significant problem \u2014 the currency misalignment of the dollar and the Chinese yuan \u2014 and so could end up doing more harm than good.Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign sought to channel the anger of many Americans over unfair trade. I understand this anger, having documented in my research the millions of manufacturing jobs lost in the United States as a result of flawed trading relationships with China and Mexico. But rhetoric doesn\u2019t always equal insight, and the president\u2019s approach ignores two key facts.First, trade deals on their own don\u2019t have much potential to help America\u2019s workers. Contemporary trade agreements may be nominally concerned with rules and tariffs, but their primary outcome has been to tilt the playing field in favor of foreign investors, which merely continues a cycle of outsourced production. Tinkering at the margins, as evidenced by recent rewrites of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement, alters mostly just the optics of trade policy. It sends a message that the president is \u201cbeing tough.\u201d But it\u2019s unlikely to have a meaningful impact.The second fact is that currency misalignment \u2014 not trade deals \u2014 is the single most important driver of growing United States trade deficits. From 1997 to 2014, China purchased $4 trillion in United States Treasury bills and other assets to bid up the value of the dollar relative to the Chinese yuan. (China sold some of its reserves in 2015 and 2016 to stabilize the yuan, but this year it again bought foreign assets to keep the yuan from rising.) This has made China\u2019s currency artificially cheap, creating what is effectively a huge subsidy for Chinese exports to the United States. It also imposes a de facto tax on all United States exports to China.Growing trade with low-wage countries like China has decimated the earnings of 100 million non-college-educated workers in the United States \u2014 two-thirds of the work force. And job losses have devastated entire regions of America\u2019s industrial heartland, especially in the upper Midwest. Not surprisingly, this includes some of the once reliably Democratic states that President Trump carried in the last election.Although China is no longer officially manipulating the value of its currency, the dollar remains significantly overvalued \u2014 in part because China is sitting on more than $3 trillion in foreign assets. The dollar is now overvalued by at least 25 to 30 percent against not just the Chinese yuan but also the Japanese yen and the euro. Notably, the dollar has risen further since Mr. Trump was elected, increasing roughly 6 percent in trade-weighted value since January 2018 alone, which further encumbers domestic manufacturers.Unfortunately, currency misalignment can\u2019t be fixed by updating trade deals. It\u2019s a global problem driven largely by continuing foreign demand for United States securities and financial assets. Since 2014, private foreign investment in American financial assets has increased the dollar\u2019s real, trade-weighted value by 20 percent. The dollar must be realigned against not just the Chinese yuan but also against the currencies of countries that have been running chronic trade surpluses for many years.Previous Republican presidents have taken steps to tackle an overvalued dollar. (In 1971, for example, Richard Nixon imposed a temporary import surcharge on all imports; it led to an agreement four months later to lower the dollar\u2019s value.) What\u2019s required is the political will to stand up to powerful actors like Walmart and Apple that benefit from continued currency misalignment. The president should apply leverage on America\u2019s trading partners \u2014 a fee on incoming foreign capital, tariff threats or coordinated currency intervention \u2014 to realign the dollar.Congress could try to force the president\u2019s hand, threatening to impose significant taxes on capital inflows to reduce demand for United States financial assets. But the authority to negotiate on currency rests in the hands of the executive. And until President Trump grasps the severity of the dollar problem, making a \u201cgreat deal\u201d on trade agreements will matter little for United States manufacturers.Robert E. Scott is a senior economist and the director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Momentous Election in Brazil: What\u2019s at Stake?", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Bolsonaro, 63, a former army captain, was first elected to Congress in 1991. During most of his legislative career, he was a marginal figure known for speaking nostalgically about the 1964-1985 military dictatorship and for making incendiary comments about women and minorities.But as the country\u2019s main political parties were swept up in a large-scale corruption investigation, known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash, Mr. Bolsonaro has pitched himself to voters as an anti-establishment maverick who will fight graft. And in a country traumatized by violent crime, his iron-fisted approach to law and order has appealed to voters in traditionally left-wing strongholds.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s meteoric rise is all the more remarkable because he campaigned on a shoestring budget, relying largely on social media, while his rivals enjoyed generous public funding and coveted slots on television and radio, which are awarded based on party size.Weeks before the first round of voting, Mr. Bolsonaro was stabbed at a rally and was forced to campaign from his bed. Wall-to-wall coverage of the attack, though, kept him in the headlines and seemed to have increased his appeal.Mr. Bolsonaro also benefited from last-minute endorsements from evangelicals and the powerful agribusiness industry.Mr. Haddad\u2019s campaign, which began only a month before the first round of voting, faced its own challenges. He was chosen to replace Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on the ballot after the former president, who is serving a prison term on corruption and money-laundering charges, was barred from running as the Workers\u2019 Party candidate.Mr. da Silva had been leading in the polls until the courts ruled in August that he was ineligible to run.Despite the campaign slogan \u201cHaddad Is Lula,\u201d the less charismatic Mr. Haddad has failed to fully win over the former president\u2019s base. He also faced the wrath of voters who blamed the Workers\u2019 Party not only for the corruption scandal but also for a crippling recession that began on the watch of Mr. da Silva\u2019s successor, former President Dilma Rousseff.Soaring crime, a struggling economy and corruption have dominated the debate.Although Mr. Bolsonaro could not point to any major accomplishments during his seven terms as a lawmaker, he highlighted his clean record. He cultivated an image as a crude but honest candidate and vowed to reject traditional horse-trading.Brazilians\u2019 disgust with politics as usual became apparent in the first round of voting, when conservatives allied with Mr. Bolsonaro won a surprising number of congressional seats \u2014 52 up from eight \u2014 making his Social Liberal Party the second-largest in the lower house.While Mr. Haddad tried to distance himself from Mr. da Silva after the first round of voting \u2014 removing the former president\u2019s image from campaign ads and swapping the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s traditional red for the blue, green and yellow of the Brazilian flag \u2014 he dodged questions about the party\u2019s responsibility for the corruption scandal.Those positions are popular among many Brazilians because of the epidemic of violence plaguing much of the country, where a record 62,517 people were killed last year.Opponents of Mr. Bolsonaro have drawn attention to his long history of racist, homophobic and misogynistic remarks. The attorney general earlier this year charged him with inciting hatred against minorities, citing a speech during which Mr. Bolsonaro described visiting a traditional community of black Brazilians, whom he called fat and so lazy that they were \u201cnot even capable of procreating.\u201dMany of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters regard his controversial positions and remarks \u2014 he has called women ignorant, told a female lawmaker she was too ugly to rape and questioned why women should earn the same salary as men \u2014 as straight talk from a decisive and authentic politician.On the economy, Mr. Haddad appealed to poor voters with promises to extend social spending and \u201cmake Brazil happy again.\u201d But Mr. Bolsonaro has sought to win over the middle and upper classes, as well as the markets, by choosing Paulo Guedes, a pro-business, University of Chicago-trained investor to be his future finance minister.A victory by Mr. Bolsonaro could signal the crumbling of much of the political establishment, which has been dominated by the Workers\u2019 Party since 2002.\u201cThose red good-for-nothings will be banished from the homeland,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a cleanup the likes of which has never been seen in Brazilian history.\u201dSome Brazilians have been concerned that Mr. Haddad\u2019s election could undermine the Car Wash investigation and lead to Mr. da Silva\u2019s release from jail. That gave them a reason to back Mr. Bolsonaro.Perhaps the biggest challenge facing the next president is the economy. Brazil is struggling to emerge from its worst recession on record, which left nearly 13 million people unemployed.Mr. Bolsonaro has promised to champion the agribusiness sector, which seeks to open up more forests to produce beef and soybeans. He has threatened to weaken or eliminate the Environment Ministry and withdraw funding from agencies that punish illegal loggers and miners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Populists and the Rise of Right-Wing Globalization ", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president and the far right want to keep the free movement of goods and money, but not of people. Mr. Slobodian is the author of \u201cGlobalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism.\u201dFor those of us who came of age in the 1990s, there was an eerie sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Then, too, there were protests against global institutions insulated from democratic decision-making. In the most iconic confrontation, my college classmates helped scupper the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999.The movement called for \u201calter-globalization\u201d \u2014 a different kind of globalization more attentive to labor and minority rights, the environment and economic equality. Two decades later, traces of that movement are hard to find. But something surprising has happened in the meantime. A new version of alter-globalization has won \u2014 from the right.We often hear that world politics is divided between open versus closed societies, between globalists and nationalists. But these analyses obscure the real challenge to the status quo.President Trump and the far right preach not the end of globalization, but their own strain of it, not its abandonment but an alternative form. They want robust trade and financial flows, but they draw a hard line against certain kinds of migration. The story is not one of open versus closed, but of the right cherry-picking aspects of globalization while rejecting others. Goods and money will remain free, but people won\u2019t.The pattern of right-wing alter-globalization is repeated in Germany and Austria, where the Alternative for Germany and the Austrian Freedom Party have recently recorded electoral wins. Neither party proposes national self-sufficiency or economic withdrawal. In their programs, the rejection of economic globalization is highly selective. The European Union is condemned, but the language demanding increased trade and competitiveness is entirely mainstream. The Alternative for Germany takes fiscal conservatism to an absurd degree with criminal charges demanded for policymakers who overspend. Both parties call for no inheritance tax and burdensome regulations, even as they make new promises for social spending.Like Hong Kong and Singapore, these zones would not be isolated but hyper-connected, nodes for the flow of finance and trade ruled not by democracy (which would cease to exist) but market power with disputes settled through private arbitration. No human rights would exist beyond the private rights codified in contract and policed through private security forces. As Mr. Hoppe argues, the alt-right and identitarian vision of \u201ca place for every race\u201d need not conflict with a global division of labor. None of this need disrupt commercial exchange and the international division of labor. As Mr. Hoppe wrote, \u201cnot even the most exclusive form of segregationism has anything to do with a rejection of free trade.\u201d The maxim would be: separate but global.The varieties of right-wing alter-globalization differ significantly in degrees of horror. What they share is a rejection not of the \u201cpostwar international order\u201d \u2014 as many pundits fruitlessly argue \u2014 but of the order of the 1990s. In the cross hairs are the products of that decade, above all, the crown jewels of neoliberal globalism: the W.T.O., the European Union and Nafta (which was recently renegotiated and renamed).The right\u2019s alter-globalizers unite in a condemnation of the structures of multilateral governance that emerged from that decade along with their implication that democracy and capitalism were twins joined at the reported \u201cend of history.\u201dInstead, in a forthright embrace of inegalitarianism, they question the ability of every country and every population to practice democratic capitalism and, in many cases, propose a departure from status quo democratic capitalism themselves. The idea that openness is under attack is too vague. The formula of right-wing alter-globalization is: yes to free finance and free trade. No to free migration, democracy, multilateralism and human equality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Angela Merkel Could Save Europe. Why Won\u2019t She?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMs. Smith is a fellow at the Robert Bosch Academy.Unfortunately, in the 18 months since, Ms. Merkel has failed to fulfill that pledge. The European Union\u2019s promise to form an \u201cever closer union\u201d seems more like an empty slogan than a strategy these days. But further integration is necessary. With Europe besieged by illiberal forces inside (Hungary) and from outside (Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia), and voters electing anti-European Union populists, leaders across the Continent need to demonstrate that they are confident about Europe\u2019s shared future. Ms. Merkel clearly understands this \u2014 but she isn\u2019t helping Europe to do anything about it.But blaming domestic politics for Ms. Merkel\u2019s failure to push for further European integration misses a bigger story. Over the last year, she\u2019s delivered several lofty speeches about the need to maintain European Union unity and protect open societies. But she\u2019s said little about how those broad aims translate into actual policies.Her actions stand in marked contrast to those of President Emmanuel Macron of France. Whereas Ms. Merkel lacks concrete ideas, Mr. Macron oozes them. Since he was elected last year, he has proposed dozens of ways to deepen European integration: the creation of a European Union finance minister, a joint military force, a eurozone budget, a European intelligence agency and a common asylum policy \u2014 to name just a few.Ms. Merkel, who is a big fan of public polling, has also no doubt noted the rising opposition to Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas inside Germany (and, indeed, inside France, where Mr. Macron\u2019s popularity has plummeted). Germans may have fallen madly in love with Mr. Macron during his election campaign but that love affair is fading. Today, Germans complain about a \u201cMacron hangover\u201d often in tandem with \u201cEurope fatigue.\u201d There\u2019s a sense in Germany that Berlin will ultimately pick up the tab for any deeper European integration. Germans feel like they already paid to save Europe once, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. They don\u2019t want to do it again.Understanding all this, Ms. Merkel will continue to nod politely when Mr. Macron presents innovative proposals, but she\u2019s not going to grab his outstretched hand. That approach will certainly prevent Germany from paying more, at least in the short term, and could possibly save her political career.But Ms. Merkel needs to ask herself about the long-term costs of failure: How much does Germany stand to lose if the European project continues to falter, if the French-German engine stalls and, when European leaders meet this month, they fail to produce fresh thinking? Deeper European integration and a demonstration of faith in Europe\u2019s common values and its common fate are necessary to keep the populist tide at bay. If Mr. Macron loses the battle that he is waging against Viktor Orban\u2019s illiberal Hungary, Germany will surely pay a price sooner or later. In her final term in office, Ms. Merkel needs to summon the courage to work with Mr. Macron to lift the European Union out of its existential crisis by making good on some of the French president\u2019s proposals. The future of Europe depends on it.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Horst Seehofer as the leader of the Social Democrats.

Keeps Calling Him a \u2018Big-City Rapper.\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORT EWEN, N.Y. \u2014 It has taken 12 years, but Antonio Delgado has finally received recognition for his brief career as a rap artist.All it took was for him to run for Congress in New York.Its first ad went further, interspersing images of Mr. Delgado as a candidate with those of him as a rapper known as A.D. the Voice, using his decade-old lyrics to suggest that he is misogynistic, racist and un-American.The video ads have injected elements of race and identity in a contest already fraught with national implications: The race between Mr. Delgado and the Republican incumbent, Representative John Faso, is thought to be a tossup, so both parties are heavily invested in the district, which covers much of the Hudson Valley and Catskills regions.Mr. Delgado, who is African-American, has said the ads are an effort to \u201cotherize\u201d him in the 19th Congressional District, which is overwhelmingly white. But voters like Mona Moore, 82, said they are \u201cdefinitely racist.\u201dMs. Moore, who met Mr. Delgado at a recent meet-and-greet here, said the candidate depicted by the Republican ads did not resemble the one she heard talk about health care and campaign finance reform. \u201cI think he\u2019s very intelligent; I think his values are commensurate with the Democratic Party,\u201d she said.For Mr. Delgado, however, the ads represent something more sinister than simply portraying him as a rapper. They are a powerful distraction from the issues that matter to voters.\u201cThey really want to talk about health care \u2014 they really do,\u201d he said of voters. \u201cThey want to talk about schools, the environment and jobs. Instead of talking about that, we are talking about rap.\u201dAll of this has made Mr. Delgado \u2014 a lawyer, Rhodes scholar and Harvard Law graduate \u2014 weary and reflective of the divisions in the nation. Having just watched the explosive Senate hearing on the sexual assault allegation against the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, he arrived at the meet-and-greet house party, on grounds that overlook the pewter-gray Hudson River here.\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie \u2014 I\u2019m tired,\u201d he told four dozen supporters. \u201cNot from the campaign. I love the campaign and the energy we are experiencing across this district. But we are at each other\u2019s throats right now in this country. There is a degree of partisanship and chaos, ugliness and nastiness, the likes of which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen.\u201dSome Republican strategists believe the lyrics are a legitimate question to raise, given the sexual assault accusations currently swirling around Judge Kavanaugh.\u201cIn this environment right now, when people\u2019s actions from 35 years ago are relevant, it makes sense that if you said those words, they should be relevant and go to character,\u201d said Susan Del Percio, a Republican political consultant who has worked with Mr. Faso in the past.But political observers said that given the makeup of the district, where voters gave both President Barack Obama and President Trump the edge, the negative ads could actually help Mr. Delgado, who lives in Rhinebeck with his wife and two young sons.\u201cIn some ways, it\u2019s a test of how far we have come, whether it matters in that district,\u201d said Christopher B. Mann, an assistant professor of political science at Skidmore College. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say whether it will be a pivotal factor or maybe to his advantage. The ads have drawn national attention, and they\u2019ve raised Delgado\u2019s profile.\u201dSince the first radio ad started airing in July, Delgado campaign officials said they have seen a shot of energy. In August, some 500 volunteers knocked on 13,000 doors and made 32,000 phone calls.Having spent recent months in Washington, Mr. Faso is playing catch-up on his campaign. In the 24 hours after arriving in the district last Friday, he attended two high school football games, a veterans event, a business fair, an Elks Club barbecue, a Knights of Columbus dinner and a sportsmen\u2019s club meeting, among other events.Mr. Faso is nervous that scorn for Mr. Trump among Democrats could cost him a seat he has held for just one term; the district has more registered Democrats than Republicans. Mr. Faso, too, is bitter about what he calls misleading attack ads against him, particularly about his voting record on health care.The ad claims that Mr. Faso broke that promise when he voted in favor of the Republican health care repeal bill in committee. The ad also draws a connection between his vote and the more than $100,000 he has received from the health care industry.Mr. Faso, in an interview, said the Republican bill would have protected people with pre-existing conditions. Moreover, he said, the constituent in question was covered by Medicaid, so the whole question was moot.\u201cIt was a fake, phony ad,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t lie to her because our bill protected people with pre-existing conditions.\u201dMr. Delgado has called on Mr. Faso to denounce the negative ads about his rap music. But the congressman has declined, explaining that he does not comment on independent expenditures because it could suggest coordination, which is illegal.In any case, Mr. Faso is standing by his criticism of the lyrics, which are peppered with racial epithets, references to sex and derogatory remarks about the police. \u201cIt\u2019s important for him to explain his words,\u201d he said.When asked whether there were any lyrics he regretted, Mr. Delgado made no apology. \u201cIt\u2019s art,\u201d he said after a long pause, leveling a stony gaze in his spacious kitchen.\u201cI\u2019m very committed to the themes that I was concerned about then, chief among them people on the margins,\u201d he said. \u201cSo for me to apologize, I would in essence be apologizing for what I am doing today.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Business Is Boo-ing! The World of Extreme Haunts", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "Americans are paying to scare themselves witless, and not just on Halloween.Supported byUpon arrival, one of them, Taylor Winters, 33, a research and development engineer from Santa Ana, Calif., was ushered into a dusty RV. After a quick examination by an on-site emergency medical technician, he disrobed and was placed in a contamination suit. A disembodied voice boomed through a walkie-talkie, instructing him to trek into a hazy compound, warning that \u201cmovement had been detected\u201d and he might not be alone. For the next 45 minutes, a shaky Mr. Winters followed the voice\u2019s lead, eventually being advised to \u201ctake refuge\u201d in a fog-filled tent.But there was little peace there. A creature stampeded through a cloud of dust: lifting and relentlessly tossing Mr. Winters\u2019s helpless body. As he struggled to gain his bearings, hands enveloped Mr. Winters\u2019s neck, squeezing tightly. He was stalked throughout the haze, knocked down, and stripped from his suit as claws raked across his skin. The unrestrained being vomited onto his bare chest and dug into his flesh. \u201cJesus Christ!\u201d Mr. Winters cried out.The event concluded with Mr. Winters stripped to his boxers and curled in a fetal position, caked in mud, straw and simulated body fluids.His first words, once regaining composure, were: \u201cThat was awesome.\u201dEvery Halloween, theme parks like Universal Studios come alive with actors who are paid to startle attendees. And in recent years, elaborate haunted houses have gotten more popular each fall. But these seasonal events are merely child\u2019s play compared to what is happening year-round in the underground world of immersive horror.Mr. Marcato said he stumbled into the business in 2013 after paying an unusual sort of homage to a friend who was murdered: re-enacting her death for a group of friends at his home. \u201cEveryone that came through was completely terrified and loved it,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI thought we should just continue doing this and see what happens.\u201dHeretic runs one to two shows per month in Los Angeles and has recently expanded to host European ventures and \u201ccannabis haunts,\u201d where marijuana consumption, which often has the side effect of paranoia, enhances an already chilling experience. Each show is vastly different. Mr. Marcato has buried people alive; flipped guests upside down in immersion devices to witness simulated torture from \u201can art deco perspective,\u201d as he put it; pushed people off balconies (they landed on an airbag hidden below); and tricked attendees into thinking their heads would be ignited in flames. \u201cEverybody called the safe word on that,\u201d he said. To keep his scenes safe but immensely realistic, Mr. Marcato works with Hollywood stuntmen like Alex Hill, 36, a special effects coordinator on the hit NBC show \u201cThe Good Place,\u201d who handles everything from staging a hanging to lighting actors on fire. \u201cWe are gearing up to a simulation where guests are trapped inside a car that gets lit on fire,\u201d Mr. Hill said.Actors are crucial to the experience. John Granillo, 33, who has worked as a \u201cscare actor\u201d for the past 15 years, prides himself on his ability to size up a guest and play upon their individualized fear triggers. \u201cI scope them out in the dark, see how they move, and decide if I should grab them from behind, from underneath, from on top,\u201d he said. Mr. Granillo has worked for other haunted ventures, but said Heretic is the most fulfilling, as Mr. Marcato allows him to completely improvise the guest experience. \u201cThe only rules are don\u2019t kill them and don\u2019t physically scar them,\u201d Mr. Granillo said.Extreme haunts first became popular as Halloween events, but companies have begun offering them year-round. Miasma, a company in Chicago, which has been staging them seasonally for the past four years, is adding more dates. Justin Brink, the founder, says he caters to the patron seeking something \u201cmuch more aggressive and meaningful within a horror experience\u201d than a traditional haunted house.\u201cOur audience actively seeks us out and prepares themselves for the experience,\u201d he said.Faceless Ventures, which runs six shows a year in the U.K., is known for its food challenges during which guests are asked to eat century eggs and bugs, among other things. The venture also has offered binding and gagging, claustrophobia, stress and physical tests, water, electric, coffin burials, sound and sight deprivation, for around $170 per pop.Hvrting, another Los Angeles-based company, provides one-night, invitation-only haunts every two to three months, tackling everything from an extreme spa experience, complete with chest waxing and lavender water-boarding, to an underground gambling ring \u201cwhere you have nothing to bet but your life.\u201d Even Hollywood moguls are getting into the game. Theater Macabre, which opens in Los Angeles on October 11th and will run indefinitely, is a choose-your-own-fate immersive theater experience by Clint Sears, Gordon Bijelonic and Darren Bousman, all mainstays of horror films.\u201cI\u2019ve made 14 movies and I\u2019ve never seen the reactions out of a \u2018Saw\u2019 movie than I have with one of my immersive experiences,\u201d said Mr. Bousman, who worked on the second through fourth installments of that franchise.His latest endeavor will have guests venturing between 27 rooms, their destinies determined by the decisions they make from the moment they walk in the door. \u201cYour tracks go anywhere from PG to PG-13 to R onward to NC-17 based on the choices that you make,\u201d he added. (Let it be noted here that this refers to violence; the realm of extreme haunts is not, generally speaking, sexual.) Mr. Bousman\u2019s goal for this particular experience is to \u201cmake people tense\u201d and \u201csnap out of the zombified state that we all live in.\u201d\u201cFor two hours, we own you and you will not have your cellphones. We will push you the entire time to do things that you consider dangerous and when you leave, there is that rush of adrenaline that you feel because you have done something that is not every day in your life,\u201d Mr. Bousman said.Some devoted fans, like Suchada Juntarakawe, 41, have gone so far as to tattoo company logos on their bodies. A casino accountant, Ms. Juntarakawe said the haunts have helped her to process an array of emotions, and work through social anxiety, depression and even suicidal thoughts.Mary Pavlovsky, 53, who also attended the haunt, was wrapped in head-to-toe plastic, a cardboard box slammed over her head, and thrashed around like a rag doll. \u201cI\u2019m a little bruised up but I knew that walking in the door and I\u2019m O.K. with that because of the nature of this,\u201d said Ms. Pavlovsky, a student services aide at a community college, adding, \u201cI get a sense of pride from being fit enough to handle it.\u201dExtreme haunts are perhaps jarring or inexplicable to the average person, and sometimes even to those who understand the industry. \u201cAs a horror filmmaker, I have a strong stomach for fear, but these experiences seem a little too intense even for me,\u201d said Amanda Toye, 34, a screenwriter in Los Angeles. David H. Zald, a professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University who studies sensation-seeking, warned: \u201cIf someone has a history of past trauma, exposing themselves to a plotline of that nature could actually set them up for re-experiencing that trauma.\u201dBut other mental-health experts say there are potential benefits to undergoing extreme haunts.\u201cThere was a global decrease in brain reactivity to different cognitive and emotional stimuli,\u201d Ms. Kerr said, theorizing that these experiences may be functioning as a recalibration of a person\u2019s distress tolerance. Post-haunt, participants had a lesser tendency to ruminate on things that were bothering them beforehand. \u201cPeople also feel like they are challenging their fears and learning about themselves and that is inherently rewarding,\u201d Ms. Kerr said.Ms. Kerr has also seen bonding occur between participants \u2014 the recreational equivalent of war buddies, perhaps. Certainly this is true of Heretic\u2019s loyal constituents. After Mr. Marcato\u2019s haunts, patrons often get together to compare stories of their experience. \u201cWe\u2019ll usually go to a nearby Denny\u2019s,\u201d Mr. Winters said. \u201cAnd yes, I have sat down in a booth and ordered an omelet, completely covered in fake blood.\u201dBut following Heretic\u2019s latest venture, it wasn\u2019t breakfast that Ms. Juntarakawe was craving, it was a shower. \u201cI had to wash my hair three times to get all the slime out!\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Wrong With Germany\u2019s Social Democrats?", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe party should be embracing the challenge of economic inequality. Instead, it\u2019s shrinking away.Mr. Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.HAMBURG, Germany \u2014 What does it take to make a major political party so frustrated with itself that it prefers therapy over governing? The German Social Democrats are mired in a sort of depression. Call it power-phobia. The party governs the country as the junior partner with the center-right Christian Democrats, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2014 yet many members fear that carrying on in this coalition might destroy them.The party seems to be in free fall. In recent elections in the state of Bavaria, the Social Democrats, known by their German acronym SPD, scored their worst result ever, sliding from 20.6 to 9.7 percent. There is another election due in the state of Hessen this Sunday, where polls point to a similar result.Part of the party\u2019s problem is that Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives have co-opted many of the center-left\u2019s ideas, from the introduction of the minimum wage to the establishment of same-sex marriage, and in doing so both embraced and suffocated the Social Democrats.But there\u2019s another, self-inflicted reason for the malaise of the SPD. In the past two decades the Social Democrats have shifted to the right economically, but (perhaps as a compensation) to the left culturally. This may be fine for the country\u2019s urban upper classes, but it leaves most German voters confused about the party\u2019s appeal.At the same time, the SPD has ignored an issue that a center-left party, born of the labor movement, should be eager to embrace. Germany, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy and Europe\u2019s richest country, is a prosperous place \u2014 but one rived by inequality and social injustice.You have to look twice at traditional data to see the scale of the problem. Unemployment has halved in the past 20 years, from around 11 percent to around 5 percent; private wealth has nearly doubled, to 11.7 trillion euros today. Wages have risen, too. Meanwhile, the richest 10 percent of the households in Germany possess nearly 60 percent of the entire net household wealth, according to a study by the trade union-linked Hans B\u00f6ckler foundation, well over the average for developed countries. This is Ms. Merkel\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel. Why has SPD not attacked it?The answers is that, in order to do so, the Social Democrats would have to confront themselves with their very own shortcomings, with failures that touch the heart of their leftist self-image. Over the last two decades, largely under the auspices of the Social Democrats \u2014 either as the governing party, or as the junior party with control over domestic ministries \u2014 state-financed poverty has been replaced by privately-financed poverty.The maximum rate kicks in comparatively early, with an annual income of around 55,000 euros. But how fair is it, from a leftist point of view, that the same tax rate applies to someone earning 200,000 euros? Nor did the SPD seem to mind that the chief executive of Deutsche Post earns 239 times the salary of his average employee.Then came the refugee crisis, which hit at a time when the belief in solidarity among Germans themselves had reached a low. All of a sudden, it seemed, the Social Democrats rediscovered their empathy for the underprivileged \u2014 as long as they had come from abroad. The party showed a striking lack of interest, at least rhetorically, on the social costs imposed by the arrival of over a million refugees.Yet the SPD\u2019s moral outrage did little to answer a complex question that confronts the entire continent: How do you distribute scant resources fairly in a framework that transgresses national boundaries?To organize globalization in a fairer way, into one a system at least resembles the balances of the old nation state, is both a demanding and a highly demanded task for Social Democracy today. It is something that the center left should be ready to tackle. Instead, the Social Democrats turning inward, unable to answer the country\u2019s most pressing questions at a time when Germany needs them.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bynews analysisDemocrats are largely ducking the topic on the campaign trail, but few people in Washington doubt that it will be on the table if they win the House.Mr. Baker is the chief White House correspondent for The Times and an author, with Jon Meacham, Timothy Naftali and Jeffrey A. Engel, of \u201cImpeachment: An American History.\u201d COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa \u2014 President Trump was energized. Fresh from the fight to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, he was firing up thousands of supporters at a rally by complaining about how Democrats had treated his nominee and how they may yet try to remove Justice Kavanaugh from the bench.\u201cBesides that,\u201d Mr. Trump then added slyly, \u201cI have to go first, right?\u201d The crowd laughed. Perhaps only in the Trump era would the prospect of being impeached become a punch line for the president of the United States. But after almost two years of living under the cloud of a possible impeachment, it may soon cease to be a laughing matter. While Democrats are largely ducking the topic on the campaign trail, few in Washington doubt that impeachment will be on the table if they win the House on Nov. 6.If that happens, anyone who thought the battle over Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was ugly and divisive should buckle up, because history suggests it would provide only a small taste of what lies ahead. The impeachment drives against Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton tore at the nation\u2019s fabric, but an effort to remove Mr. Trump could lead to an even more incendiary conflict, thanks to the advent of social media and Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of blowtorch politics.Impeachment, by its nature, represents the ultimate test of American democracy, a titanic clash between two branches of government over whether the nation\u2019s leader has done such damage to the integrity of the Republic that the will of the people as expressed in our complicated election system should be overturned. It is, in effect, a moment of reckoning, as the framers intended it to be, a judgment on the standards of society as they shift through time.Rather than being apprehensive about the threat, Mr. Trump, who loves a good brawl, seems almost eager for Democrats to bring it on. He has begun making his case in recent months without waiting for the election. In August, he warned that if he is impeached, \u201cthe market would crash\u201d and \u201ceverybody would be very poor.\u201d In September, he told supporters it would be their fault if he is impeached because it would mean \u201cyou didn\u2019t go out to vote.\u201dAnd in Iowa, he laid out what would undoubtedly be his public argument. \u201cYou get impeached for having created the greatest economy in the history of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best job numbers in the history of our country, just about, right? The greatest trade deals, which we\u2019ve just finished, in the history of our country.\u201dPutting aside the hyperbole about the economy and jobs numbers, which are both strong but hardly the best ever, Mr. Trump has a certain advantage going into any impeachment fight. The history of presidential impeachments shows that they are started by the opposition party but are never successful unless the president\u2019s party buys into the effort.In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, a Democratic House might impeach him, but even if Democrats take the Senate, they would still be far from the two-thirds necessary for conviction, meaning that 15 or more Republicans would have to go along. Such a scenario seems unlikely unless the special counsel, Robert Mueller, produces a report with such damning information that it transforms the current political dynamics.But once again, the country would be confronted with the question of what the framers meant by \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201dNixon\u2019s case was a more clear-cut abuse of power and obstruction of justice: the Watergate burglary to spy on his political opposition and the resulting cover-up, including the payment of hush money and, finally, a transcript of the \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape of him trying to order the C.I.A. to block the F.B.I. investigation. The House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach, and Nixon resigned rather than continue to fight after fellow Republicans abandoned him.Bill Clinton\u2019s case fell somewhere in the murky middle. Charged with perjury and obstruction of justice for trying to impede a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones and by hiding his affair with a former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, Mr. Clinton was impeached on a nearly party-line vote in the House and acquitted in the Senate. Defenders were left to argue that yes, he may have violated the law, but it was not such a profound violation to merit removal.But it is hard to imagine Democrats not going there if they take the House, given the enormous pressure from their liberal base to at least open an impeachment inquiry. Three-quarters of Democrats told pollsters that they want Mr. Trump impeached. Tom Steyer, the liberal billionaire who has been financing television ads advocating impeachment, announced this past week that he has collected six million signatures on a petition.Peter Baker is an author, with Jon Meacham, Timothy Naftali and Jeffrey A.

{"Headline": "Trump Administration Releases Prudential From Strict Post-Crisis Oversight", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 And then there were none.The Trump administration said on Wednesday that Prudential Financial, the giant insurer, would no longer be subject to stricter federal oversight, bringing to zero the number of financial firms outside the banking system that face such scrutiny.The Financial Stability Oversight Council said it was removing the \u201csystemically important financial institution\u201d \u2014 or SIFI \u2014 label from Prudential after similar moves allowed American International Group, MetLife and GE Capital to escape the designation. The council applies the SIFI designation to financial firms whose collapse it believes can pose a serious threat to the financial system.The decision extends a deregulatory push that is loosening rules for banks and financial firms of all sizes. It also signals a major retreat for the council, a body established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis to help spot risks and ensure that large financial firms outside the regulated banking system did not fall through regulatory cracks.On Wednesday, the council said Prudential no longer posed the type of threat that would warrant stricter oversight.Prudential, which is bigger than all but six of the nation\u2019s largest banks, will now have more freedom to grow and make payouts to its shareholders.The decision effectively neuters the post-crisis system created to police risks at financial firms that are not banks. The oversight council was started largely as a response to the near-collapse of A.I.G., the giant insurer whose financial troubles in 2008 threatened to paralyze the financial system. The insurer, operating under lax federal scrutiny, had amassed huge, loss-making wagers that took the firm, and Wall Street more broadly, to the brink of failure, prompting a widely detested taxpayer bailout.Critics described the move to free Prudential from the stricter rules as another sign of the Trump administration\u2019s larger effort to relax financial regulations. They warned that it could allow a large swath of Wall Street to engage in risky behavior without adequate supervision.\u201cGenerically speaking, this is a message to the market that being a very large nonbank is not a problem,\u201d said Amias Gerety, a top Treasury official in the Obama administration who helped run the oversight council.New Jersey\u2019s Department of Banking and Insurance will replace the Federal Reserve as the company\u2019s main regulator. The Fed has a large staff of supervisors who oversee many giant financial institutions and monitor the vast markets for complicated financial products that Prudential trades in. The big question now is whether a state department is up to the task of assessing the risks of Prudential, which not only is huge but operates in many countries.\u201cThink about the budget and staff of the New Jersey insurance regulator, versus the far more substantial resources of the Federal Reserve,\u201d said Gregg Gelzinis, a research associate at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. \u201cIt\u2019s mind boggling.\u201dIn its report on releasing Prudential, the Treasury said a change to New Jersey laws had expanded the powers of the state\u2019s insurance regulator.Prudential said in a statement that the council\u2019s decision \u201creflects Prudential\u2019s sustainable business model, capital strength and comprehensive risk management, which have and continue to enable the company to fulfill its promises to customers, deliver consistent performance and meet regulatory obligations.\u201dInsurance analysts say Prudential, unlike other firms, did not shrink or radically change its business mix to escape the more stringent regime. It has $830 billion in assets, up from $723 billion when it was deemed a potential risk to the system should it fail.Critics of the council\u2019s actions under the Obama administration asserted that the body\u2019s deliberations were opaque. They also contended that insurance companies were less risky than banks of a similar size because they did not rely on financing that could dry up quickly in a crisis, potentially causing a run on the institution.\u201cI don\u2019t believe Prudential ever should have had the designation in the first place,\u201d said Jay Gelb, an insurance company analyst at Barclays. \u201cUnder any plausible stress scenario, I cannot envision how Prudential would have any type of liquidity challenges.\u201dThe decision by the council, which is composed of regulators from across the government, was unanimous.Alan Rappeport reported from Washington, and Peter Eavis from New York.Advertisement"}

You have friends to visit along your route, and all of them are delighted to put you up. You rent the right car, pack the right books, eat remarkably well and make your own discoveries, all roughly within your budget. Glowing memories ensue.For me, it was southern Germany, circa 2003, and it was a solo vacation: route devised according to my whims alone; tiny car stocked with audiobooks entirely of my choosing; and a freelance assignment to help finance the thing. I flew into Frankfurt where I visited college friends, and continued to Heidelberg. Then it was all work in Baden-Baden, where I had been asked to compare the town\u2019s famed Old World spa treatments with the latest high-tech spas in New York for a women\u2019s magazine (a hardship assignment, to be sure).For nearly three weeks, I meandered through the Black Forest, across the Alpenstrasse where small woodland creatures seemed to frolic beside me Snow White-style, in the early October frost, into Munich and then up north through a landscape speckled with Germany\u2019s famed castles and medieval cities (known as the Romantic Road) back to Frankfurt.These things were best appreciated by a family, and I didn\u2019t have one.Fifteen years later, I do, and the plan was to replicate, as closely as possible, my original itinerary together, a family of five. Would the magic hold up and perhaps acquire extra fairy dust in the company of three medium-size children? Was the timing right, or were we too late?Now 9, 11 and 13, my children had graduated from wooden playthings, and left behind earlier days of reading Grimm, watching the Disney versions on repeat and memorizing the lyrics from \u201cInto the Woods.\u201d They\u2019d moved on to Greek myths and J.R.R. Tolkien, Dungeons & Dragons and dystopian fiction. Though the source material was clearly the same.Traveling with one or two kids is relatively straightforward: You can rent pretty much any size car. You can squeeze into a single room. Not so when you\u2019ve overdone it with three or more. Everything is more complicated at hotels, especially with three children who are at an age when asking any of them to share a bed is like putting two cats in a bag. Verboten.Unless your children have the magical combination of age, gender and disposition to sleep peacefully in the same bed (hats off), you need a room with four beds, or better yet, a room with one bed and another with three.You also need a minivan. Not a stylish European minivan that could pass for a car if you squint. No, you need a big, dumb American version \u2014 and do not confuse that with an S.U.V., which has neither the legroom for five nor the trunk capacity for five suitcases. Car rental companies do not generally get into these subtleties, which is why we found ourselves staggering with jet lag at the Frankfurt airport, filling out forms to upgrade to a decent-size minivan, one that might even fit all our suitcases if we abandoned the concept of rearview vision.We were tired. We were hungry. We set off to Heidelberg on a series of German autobahns, squeezed into what felt like a Beetle.50 milesGermanyFrankfurtRhineMainNuremburgHeidelbergRothenburg ob der TauberBaden-W\u00fcrttembergBaden-BadenFranceStuttgartBavariaGutachRustNeckar R.MunichTribergblackforestMittenwaldLake ConstanceSwitzerlandAustriaBy The New York TimesWith one more challenge \u2014 or, as a fairy tale would have it, an obstacle: One of those three children is vegan and we were in southern Germany where vegetarianism is only lightly tolerated, and vegan (we tried out various pronunciations on our waiters) is understood mostly as an insult in the land of bratwurst and schnitzel. Menus had to be scrutinized, allergen lists examined. Waiters, stumped, retreated into kitchens to consult with chefs. At one Swabian restaurant, the waiter apologetically retrieved a bowl of noodles made with eggs. At another, when we asked if we could just please get a veggie plate, the owner threw up his hands. \u201cVegetables?\u201d he huffed, motioning us out. \u201cThis is a traditional Bavarian restaurant; we don\u2019t have vegetables!\u201dDriving was less challenging, despite kids prone to backseat nausea. We kept our rides under two hours. Remaining within two regions, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and Bavaria, we traveled from Heidelberg to Baden-Baden, through the Black Forest, down to the Bodensee and into Bavaria, upward to Munich and northward on the Romantic Road back to Frankfurt.Our hotels began in jetlag-friendly luxury, before downshifting to more modest, but still spacious, lodgings and a three-day Airbnb in Munich, with a strategic happy ending at a castle stay outside Rothenburg ob der Tauber.I had originally envisioned reading Grimm tales to my children at night as we roamed the Black Forest. But if I\u2019d suggested \u201cHansel and Gretel\u201d at their current ages, they\u2019d have sent me off to Frau Holle to do her worst. Instead, to keep things at least somewhat within the spirit of the traditional German fairy tale, we listened to Edgar Allan Poe audiobook stories in the car. At night, my youngest read a series based on the Norse myths, but set in the Black Hills of South Dakota. My middle child picked up his first Stephen King and my eldest blitzed her way through an endless series of post-apocalyptic doom. I read a Jo Nesbo thriller to keep up the spirit.Darkness truly descended in Triberg, a touristy slice of the Black Forest set on a hill under Germany\u2019s highest waterfall. Here, I had promised my children a visit to the Cuckoo Clock Museum. I had such fond memories of the place! The museum\u2019s main room was huge, cavernous, sunken, wood-paneled. Inside, Geppetto-style, was clock after chirping clock, each more wondrously intricate than the last.And so we went to the park. Two of them. In recent decades, \u201cbarefoot parks,\u201d public spaces specifically groomed to accommodate earthy types without their Birkenstocks, have sprung up around Europe, mostly in Germany and Austria. For a small fee, visitors are provided lockers for their shoes, before setting off on a path designed to heighten one\u2019s attention to the senses, from the painful spike of walking across wood chips or on gravel, to the squishiness of traipsing through mud puddles. Along the way, visitors are encouraged to touch, smell and explore the outdoors and meditate in the shade.Europa Park is like Disneyland stripped of its commercial veneer. Organized nominally by European country, food and rides reflect each geographic region. Germany naturally covers the most territory and a lovely section is dedicated to Grimm\u2019s Enchanted Forest, where the tales are fairly represented without cuddly bunnies to offset the fright.Rather than dumping ridegoers into a character-ridden emporium after each 45-second ride, the park relegates stores largely to the background. Not once did I hear, \u201cCan we get?\u201d or \u201cI want that!\u201d The food was varied and halfway decent, but once my kids discovered the Food Loop, where patrons order by touch-screen and meals are delivered to your table via a massive marble mazelike contraption, further culinary exploration was put to a halt.A subtler fairy tale setting was found in the small town of Mittenwald, Germany\u2019s center for violin-making, with its impeccably preserved pedestrian old town, canals flowing along the cobblestone streets. The exterior walls of its whitewashed buildings are painted Bavarian-style with biblical scenes and imagery depicting the varying trades of the shopkeepers and restaurateurs within. My two cello-playing sons were entranced by visits to the studios of the celebrated luthiers, Anton Maller, who allowed my trembling older son to play a $10,000 cello, and Anton Sprenger, who gave us an impromptu concert on his own violin. (A photo on the wall showed him in the company of Angela Merkel and a grinning Barack Obama. We were likewise dazzled.)The viewer, or more accurately, the participant, enters a dark room whose walls are covered with words scrawled in chalk. Wearing a virtual reality headset with attached remote controls, you\u2019re offered various options (Ms. Anderson\u2019s gravelly voice guides you) for exploring the virtual landscape. You can fly, for example, through swirling words or plunge yourself headlong into the text. Phrases rush by, occasionally forming sentences. You are fully immersed in \u2014 and only occasionally in control of \u2014 the narrative.It\u2019s a very contemporary form of storytelling, a technologically enhanced one, a kind of modern magic, a voyage of discovery where you are at once storyteller and reader. We emerged, all of us, flushed with enchantment.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "They\u2019re Trained for War. Now American Troops Are Headed to the U.S. Border.", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut using the world\u2019s most powerful military to stop some 3,000 unarmed migrants who may or may not make it to the United States border might not be the best use of taxpayer dollars at the Defense Department. Here\u2019s why.Defense Department officials say the border deployment is set to last until Dec. 15. It is not clear how much it will cost to send active-duty military troops to the border for the 45-day deployment, and neither the Pentagon nor the White House has provided a price estimate.Had the 2006 operation lasted 45 days, it would have cost $28 million to support 5,200 troops \u2014 or $35 million in today\u2019s dollars.The document itself does reference a need to build a border wall to stop illegal immigration. But at the time, Mr. Mattis said nothing of terrorism threatening the American homeland by way of a caravan of migrants from El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua.Administration officials said Mr. Mattis was against the border mission, but he was overruled by Mr. Trump, the commander in chief.Multiple Pentagon officials have privately said deploying troops to the southwest border will hurt \u201creadiness\u201d \u2014 military jargon for having enough forces trained and ready to fight. It also runs contrary to the Pentagon\u2019s renewed emphasis on \u201clethality,\u201d a military buzzword that refers to the ability to quickly overpower enemies.\u201cYou\u2019ve got 5,000 troops that are trained and ready, and we\u2019re using them for something other than their intended mission,\u201d said Todd Harrison, the director of defense budget analysis with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, and a close watcher of the Pentagon\u2019s budget.\u201cAnd when they get back,\u201d Mr. Harrison said, \u201cthey will have not been doing their normal training, and won\u2019t be ready if something happens.\u201dCommitting troops to one operation means fewer forces for another. Compared with how many troops the United States has stationed in Syria (2,000), in Afghanistan (14,000) and in Iraq (5,000), the number of soldiers sent to Texas, Arizona and California will be a significant slice of all troops deployed worldwide.It is true that the border mission would require only a fraction of the roughly 1.3 million active-duty troops in the American military. But assigning engineers, medical staff and logistic personnel to the border will also deplete those limited number of specialized troops if they are needed for a national disaster or to deploy to a war zone.Quickly sending more than 5,200 troops, their vehicles and equipment to the southwest border is no easy task and will require a small fleet of aircraft to accomplish effectively. That means transportation jets and other aircraft will have to be repurposed from other assignments.The troops will come from bases across the country and be sent to ones near border towns in Brownsville, Tex.; in Nogales, Ariz.; and in Southern California. There, troops will need to be housed and fed. That means they will need temporary eating facilities and tents if permanent facilities are overwhelmed \u2014 or if they are sent to more austere locations.One reason Mr. Mattis initially sought to send only 800 troops is because they will have little to do beyond providing logistical support unless Mr. Trump declares martial law.Four years ago, the country was in a furor over another purported enemy approaching its borders: Ebola.The deadly epidemic took hold in three West African countries \u2014 but not in the United States, where only two people died. Both were West Africans.That did not stop Mr. Trump, then a businessman and critic of the Obama administration, from calling for the United States to shut its borders \u2014 even to American citizens.On the eve of the 2014 midterm elections, with control of the Senate at stake, Republicans and many Democrats took up Mr. Trump\u2019s call. They criticized President Barack Obama for refusing to close American airports to people who had traveled to Liberia, Sierra Leone or Guinea.Once Election Day had passed, the scare suddenly quieted. Politicians stopped demanding a travel ban. Television news programs stopped round-the-clock coverage. And Media Matters, a watchdog group, reported that evening broadcast and cable news programs aired close to 1,000 segments on Ebola in the four weeks before the midterm elections and only 49 in the two weeks after.The migrant caravan is around 900 miles away, and most of the people in it are walking. Even if they managed to walk 20 miles a day, they most likely would not arrive until after Dec. 15.Put another way, the caravan is at least 45 days from the southwest border. As of Tuesday, American troops were scheduled to end their border deployment in 46 days.\u201cNone of this practically is going to amount to anything,\u201d said Jon Soltz, an Iraq war veteran and a founder of VoteVets.org, a progressive veterans advocacy group.An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of the co-founder of a veterans advocacy group. He is Jon Soltz, not Stoltz.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Charging Drivers Really Solve the Subway Crisis?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe subway\u2019s leader, Andy Byford, says he needs $40 billion to fix the system. Congestion pricing could help pay for his plan, but it won\u2019t cover the entire tab. The idea of charging drivers to enter Manhattan\u2019s busiest neighborhoods has been debated for decades, but it could finally have a real shot in Albany next year. The short answer is no. But it could be a major piece of a broader funding solution. The answer also depends on how the vehicle fees are structured, the size of the subway renovation plan and how much money is siphoned away to other priorities. Under congestion pricing, drivers pay a fee to enter parts of Manhattan, from 60th Street south to the Battery, during the busiest times of day. The money would go to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the subway.\u201cIt\u2019s head and shoulders above any other conceivable new funding stream,\u201d Charles Komanoff, a transportation expert, said of congestion pricing. \u201cIt\u2019s far bigger, and it\u2019s also the only one that does immense good for transportation at the same time by unclogging the streets and roads.\u201dWe still don\u2019t know exactly how much the subway overhaul plan will cost. Albany is also known for horse trading. As part of any deal, suburban leaders could ask for some revenue to go toward the region\u2019s commuter railroads or other infrastructure needs.Subway officials say congestion pricing is only part of the solution. \u201cWe need reliable, sustainable, predictable funding sources \u2014 we believe that would certainly include congestion pricing, but we can\u2019t limit ourselves to that,\u201d said Jon Weinstein, an M.T.A. spokesman.Mr. de Blasio has stubbornly opposed congestion pricing \u2014 a position that has aggravated transit advocates. Mr. de Blasio has said it would hurt low-income residents, even though research shows that middle class and wealthy residents would be more likely to pay the tolls.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat in his second term, said he is hopeful that state lawmakers will tackle subway funding if Democrats win control of the State Senate. Hiking the state gas tax. Increasing vehicle registration fees. Fares are a major part of the budget, but subway leaders do not want to raise them beyond the regular increases that are scheduled for every two years. It certainly won\u2019t be easy. But there is some momentum for congestion pricing.Corey Johnson, the speaker of the City Council, has been a vocal supporter.Congestion pricing has traditionally faced opposition from leaders in the boroughs outside Manhattan whose constituents sometimes rely on cars. It remains to be seen whether the subway crisis could push some of those lawmakers to embrace the idea.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Eurozone Growth Slips to Four-Year Low, Fueling Crisis Fears", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Economic growth in the eurozone has fallen to its slowest pace in more than four years, and Italy is not growing at all, according to figures released Tuesday. The snapshot is likely to sharpen political divisions in the European Union and make the region more vulnerable to the forces rattling financial markets.Both numbers were unexpectedly poor. Eurozone growth in the quarter was only half as fast as it had been in the previous three-month period, and the rate of growth has fallen each of the last three quarters.One of the European Commission\u2019s criticisms of the Italian budget is that it was based on overly optimistic estimates of future economic growth. Now those estimates look even less realistic.Investors registered their disappointment by bidding up the market interest rate on Italian government bonds on Tuesday. That will only amplify the country\u2019s problems.The rates on government bonds serve as benchmarks for the rates that Italians pay on business or consumer loans. Higher rates will squeeze spending and lead to yet slower growth.\u201cIt\u2019s a self-defeating cycle,\u201d said Lorenzo Codogno, chief economist at LC Macro Advisors in London. \u201cThe government is shooting itself in the foot.\u201dBut Mr. Codogno said he doubted that the populist parties governing Italy would retreat from their campaign promises, such as increases in pensions. To do so, he said, \u201cwould be political suicide.\u201dAnd Italy is not the only country in the eurozone facing political instability.The eurozone growth figure published Tuesday was a first estimate and contained no detail about what sectors led to the slowdown. Still, the causes are obvious enough.They include the prospect that Britain\u2019s separation from the European Union will be disruptive; a trade war with the United States that has interfered with trans-Atlantic commerce; and rising interest rates as central banks roll back the stimulus programs they used to combat the last financial crisis.Those risks are accumulating at the same time that financial markets are unusually nervous. Daily fluctuations in the prices of stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities like gold and copper are at their most extreme levels since 2008, when the last global financial crisis began, according to data compiled by analysts at the German bank Berenberg.The one somewhat bright spot in the numbers Tuesday was France, which registered growth of 0.4 percent from the previous quarter. But, coming after two weaker quarters, even that above-average result was not enough to achieve the 1.7 percent pace of expansion that economist say President Emmanuel Macron needs to validate his program of business-friendly reforms.The disappointing growth in the eurozone as a whole was partly caused by factors that aren\u2019t likely to repeat, leaving room for hope that growth will pick up toward the end of the year.For example, European car sales slumped 24 percent in September as auto manufacturers struggled to comply with new, stricter emissions standards. Cars were slow to reach dealers because of delays in getting regulators to certify vehicles for sale. Manufacturers such as BMW and Daimler have also been caught in the crossfire of President Trump\u2019s trade war with China.The slowdown in the car industry rippled through the eurozone and was probably most pronounced in Germany, the Continent\u2019s largest economy and motor of growth. Registrations of new Volkswagens slumped by nearly half in September, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The company at least temporarily lost its long-held status as the Continent\u2019s largest auto manufacturer to PSA of France, the maker of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn cars.The brake on growth caused by the auto industry should dissipate soon, \u201cand the euro economy is likely to grow more strongly again,\u201d Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients Tuesday.Bernd Meyer, chief strategist for wealth and asset management at Berenberg, pointed out that prices for tech stocks or real estate were not at the extreme levels that preceded past meltdowns.During a meeting with reporters Tuesday, Mr. Meyer argued that market pressure on Italy will eventually force the government to relent on its spending plans. But, he added, \u201cthey will only back down when they are staring into the abyss.\u201d\u201cRecent surveys,\u201d Mr. Nobile said in a note to clients, \u201care painting a rather bleak picture of eurozone growth.\u201dLiz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why German Trucks May Become a Target for Activist Investors", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsVolkswagen and Daimler are both inching toward separating out their truck businesses \u2014 but they may find themselves rattled by opinionated shareholders in the process.The move to separate out the truck businesses from their parent companies seems like a good idea, as investors tend not to ascribe much value to them inside the sprawling carmakers. But the way VW and Daimler go about setting these operations free could bring activist investors to their doorsteps.The corporate finance logic runs like this. At 13 times forecast operating profit \u2014 which is the multiple that rival truck makers Paccar and Volvo currently trade at \u2014 the VW and Daimler truck divisions would be worth 65 billion euros (around $77 billion), including debt, based on estimates from the investment banking advisory firm Evercore. Assuming that the parents, which sport a combined market value of 132 billion euros, keep their current lowly multiples of around four times operating profit, the two companies would be worth 43 billion euros more than their parents fetch today, according to calculations made by Breakingviews.But the companies risk squandering that opportunity. VW is planning a partial listing of its MAN and Scania brands, which would continue to handcuff them to its governance-challenged parent. With the automaker still calling the shots, the listed company would still effectively be part of the VW conglomerate \u2014 and hardly deserve a premium valuation. For Daimler, following the path of its rival would doom that business to a similar fate.The better option is to give the companies independence by spinning them off directly to shareholders. Fiat Chrysler did this with Ferrari, by first launching an initial public offering of 10 percent and then handing the remainder over to investors. The sports car company\u2019s stock has nearly tripled in value since. While a similar transaction would still leave VW\u2019s truck unit with many traditionalist owners, like the state of Lower Saxony, at least it would have a freer hand in charting its future.German companies, particularly automakers like VW, rarely take the lead in pursuing the best practices of corporate governance \u2014 it\u2019s not easy when, by law, unions have a big say in the boardroom. But that is changing: The nation\u2019s industrial engineering and steel conglomerate ThyssenKrupp recently said it would split into two.Of course, that took pressure from the activist investors Elliott and Cevian Capital. VW and Daimler would be wise to study that case.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Created \u2018The Bernank\u2019 on YouTube. And I Was Mostly Wrong.", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewIn November 2010, as the Federal Reserve embarked on its second round of bond buying, Omid Malekan uploaded to YouTube a cartoon called \u201cQuantitative Easing Explained,\u201d which was critical of the central bank\u2019s response to the financial crisis. Within weeks, millions of people had viewed it. Here, nearly eight years later, he says that he got it largely wrong.It has been 10 years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers marked the unofficial start of the financial crisis. For those of us in finance who lived through that period, and the countless others affected by it, it remains hard to think of it as just a moment in history. A decade removed, the experience feels more like a mass injury that \u2014 grateful as we are to have survived \u2014 still lingers, and often manifests itself in the ongoing controversy over the government\u2019s response.I am a small part of that controversy, thanks to a YouTube cartoon I published in 2010 criticizing the Federal Reserve\u2019s bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing. The popularity of that cartoon surprised me. Like most things that go viral, it was more a testament to what was on people\u2019s minds than the quality of the work. Nevertheless, terms used in the cartoon like \u201cThe Bernank\u201d entered the economic zeitgeist, resonating with people who knew that they didn\u2019t like what was happening but lacked the technical vocabulary to express why.Most of the targets of my cartoon, including Ben Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, have defended their actions and maintained that their work was effective in keeping the economic harm from worsening. I\u2019m inclined to agree. Quantitative easing worked, just not in the way it was intended. Before I explain why, I need to admit what I got wrong.Contrary to what one of my cartoon characters predicted, Q.E. didn\u2019t \u201cblow up the global economy.\u201d Instead, both economic growth and the financial markets have been remarkably steady. If anything, the expansion of central bank balance sheets has dampened volatility. It\u2019s still possible that the reversal of those policies will have a destabilizing effect, but even if that does happen \u2014 and I hope it doesn\u2019t \u2014 I was still way off the mark.The current economic expansion is one of the longest in history, and that too has surprised me. If you had asked me to predict the odds of another major recession eight years ago, not only would I have called it likely, I probably would have added that the very policies used to deal with the 2008 financial crisis would cause it. I was wrong about that, too.Ironically, those mechanics are something that Mr. Bernanke and I have always agreed on. He has often defended his actions by arguing that Q.E. is not the same as printing money because it only affects reserves in the banking system. Leaving aside the obvious overlap between the two concepts, I believe he\u2019s right. Q.E. was, first and foremost, a policy designed to enrich banks. In that sense, it worked remarkably, and tragically, well.Who does benefit? All the parties that have done disproportionately well in the past decade, like investment funds, large corporations and the wealthy. Debt levels have exploded among those groups, as have the valuations of the assets they tend to own: private companies, premium real estate and stocks. For this, I give Mr. Bernanke credit. History turned out almost as he predicted in his op-ed:\u201cLower corporate bond rates will encourage investment. And higher stock prices will boost consumer wealth and help increase confidence, which can also spur spending. Increased spending will lead to higher incomes and profits that, in a virtuous circle, will further support economic expansion.\u201dAccording to government data, almost a fifth of the United States population is either \u201cunderbanked\u201d or entirely disconnected from the financial system \u2014 a percentage that grew after the 2008 crisis. These are the people who have suffered the most in the past decade. Their existence outside the banking system almost guaranteed that they would not benefit from policies like lower interest rates.Quantitative easing worked, but not for those who needed it most.There was one other thing that I got wrong about the government\u2019s response to the financial crisis. I assumed that the effects, and side-effects, would be felt in the economic realm. But today, it\u2019s the political, social and even technological consequences that stand out.The growing wealth gap, which we now understand to be at least partially caused by such policies, has fueled many political and social movements. In this era of political polarization, the one belief that the far left and the far right increasingly share is that our economic system is somehow rigged. That perception has played a part in everything from the insurgent campaign of Bernie Sanders to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory.Most surprising of all, though, is that there is now a new kind of money \u2014 one borne out of the chaos of the financial crisis and the controversial policies enacted thereafter.Bitcoin and other digital currencies are the technological solution to a legacy monetary system that increasingly looks unfair. The decentralized nature and radical transparency of cryptocurrencies are a response to a banking system where institutions that were \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d have been enriched by Q.E. The code that underpins the Bitcoin blockchain is designed to treat the poorest citizen exactly the same way as the most powerful banker. After everything that\u2019s happened in the past decade, we can no longer say the same thing about the Fed.I disagree with some of my colleagues in the so-called cryptosphere on the potential for such coins to ever fully replace fiat money. But I am a proponent for many reasons, including the lifeboat they offer from poorly conceived economic policy. Despite the enduring controversy of the policies enacted in response to the financial crisis, their architects promise to repeat them in the future. But next time, those of us who are adversely impacted by such policies, or just morally opposed to them, won\u2019t have to stand idly by. Next time, we can take our money elsewhere.Omid Malekan is the author of \u201cThe Story of the Blockchain, a Beginner\u2019s Guide to the Technology Nobody Understands.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sri Lanka\u2019s President Suspends Parliament, Escalating Political Crisis", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sirisena suspended Parliament after ousting Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday, a move many lawmakers and government ministers denounced as unconstitutional. Mr. Sirisena swore in as prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, a popular former president who was accused of human rights abuses and corruption during a decade in power.Mr. Wickremesinghe struck a defiant tone, asserting that he was still prime minister. \u201cConvene Parliament, and I will prove it,\u201d he said.By Saturday afternoon, many lawmakers were vowing to stick by Mr. Wickremesinghe, demanding that a formal count be taken in Parliament to determine who held a majority in the house. That\u2019s when Mr. Sirisena announced that he was suspending Parliament. He also dismissed the leaders of several government institutions, replacing them with loyalists.As of 5 p.m. local time, Mr. Wickremesinghe remained in office at Temple Trees \u2014 the official state residence of the prime minister \u2014 where he briefed diplomats from the United States, Britain and elsewhere on the political developments.At a news conference earlier Saturday, he pledged to leave office if it was proved that he did not hold the majority in Parliament. The dispute could be resolved peacefully in the chamber without plunging the country into political crisis, Mr. Wickremesinghe said.But front-liners in Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s party have warned Mr. Wickremesinghe that they will give him only until Sunday morning to leave the official prime ministerial residence unless he wants the public to \u201cforce him out.\u201dTo clinch a majority in Parliament, Mr. Sirisena needs to secure just over half of its 225 seats to form a new government with Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s party. A tally on Saturday suggested they held only 98 seats.But Namal Rajapaksa, a lawmaker and the son of the former president, said by telephone that the numbers were in their favor.\u201cOf course we have more than 130 seats in Parliament, definitely,\u201d Namal Rajapaksa said. \u201cWe are already working on our policies to stabilize the economy and provide social stability.\u201dMr. Sirisena was a cabinet member in Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s government until he broke from the governing party to form a coalition with Mr. Wickremesinghe to contest the 2015 elections, which they won by a slim majority.In the run-up to elections, the coalition promised to investigate allegations of war crimes and corruption during the tenure of Mr. Rajapaksa, who simultaneously served as president and finance minister, among other cabinet positions, while his three brothers served as the defense secretary and ministers of economy and ports.But those investigations lagged under the unity government. The Rajapaksa family denies any wrongdoing, painting the allegations as lies perpetrated by their political opponents.Acrimonious divisions ultimately doomed the unity government, which was consumed by bitter infighting between Mr. Sirisena and Mr. Wickremesinghe. Sri Lankans have grown unhappy with economic stagnation and social unrest, including outbursts of sectarian violence.Whether Mr. Sirisena will face a backlash over his move remains to be seen. While Mahinda Rajapaksa is very popular, this is the first time since Sri Lanka earned independence from Britain that power has been handed over unconstitutionally, observers say.\u201cThe president has no authority to remove the prime minister,\u201d Jayadeva Uyangoda, a retired academic and political scientist, explained. \u201cThe removal of the prime minister is a function of Parliament, unless he resigns.\u201dNamal Rajapaksa, the former president\u2019s son, expressed confidence, saying the majority of Sri Lankans supported the new government because the previous cabinet had failed to govern effectively.\u201cIf you talk to people who voted for the unity government, they all agree that there is not unity in the unity government,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now you will have stability with the new government. People can oppose us, but at the end of the day, we will achieve a solution for the economic and social instability.\u201dMr. Sirisena\u2019s party may now join with Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s party, Namal Rajapaksa said, giving the family a good shot at reclaiming power in presidential elections next year.Indian and Chinese diplomats are watching the turmoil closely, having jostled over Sri Lanka in recent years as Beijing has tried to assert its influence in the region, New Delhi\u2019s traditional sphere of influence.China\u2019s ambassador to Colombo paid separate visits to Mr. Rajapaksa and Mr. Wickremesinghe on Saturday, posing for photos that each camp then disseminated to followers to project legitimacy.Under Mr. Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka\u2019s ties to India frayed while the country grew closer to China, which lent the government billions of dollars for questionable infrastructure projects.One of those, the Hambantota Seaport, became a symbol of China\u2019s dominance in Sri Lanka, with the Chinese company that built the harbor suspected of funneling money from the project to Mr. Rajapaksa. The harbor failed to attract business and was handed over last year to the state-owned China Harbor Group in a 99-year lease in exchange for debt relief.American officials worry China could eventually use the port \u2014 which sits at the crossroads of one of the world\u2019s busiest maritime routes \u2014 for military purposes, which officials in Beijing and Colombo have denied that will happen.It remains unclear whether Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s return to government would see Sri Lanka shift back to China\u2019s orbit. The former president flew to New Delhi in September and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India to smooth ties. Although China has the deep pockets India does not, many Sri Lankans consider India too geographically near to risk being on poor terms.But India\u2019s government has grown frustrated with Mr. Sirisena, accusing the president of delaying Indian infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka that were seen as diplomatic overtures. And although Indian diplomats recognize Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s popularity in the country, they are still wary of him.Dharisha Bastians reported from Colombo, and Maria Abi-Habib from Lahore, Pakistan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Khashoggi Disappearance May Disrupt Trump Administration\u2019s Plans to Squeeze Iran", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOfficials said the dilemma comes at a fraught moment for the Trump administration, which is expected to reimpose harsh sanctions against Iran on Nov. 5, with the intent of cutting off all Iranian oil exports.But to make the strategy work, the administration is counting on its relationship with the Saudis to keep global oil flowing without spiking prices, and to work together on a new policy to contain Iran in the Persian Gulf.Part of the problem is optics, officials said: Saudi Arabia looks like a brutal ally, including by leading a deadly military campaign in Yemen, just as President Trump and Mr. Pompeo have been casting Iran as the region\u2019s bully.\u201cIt\u2019s a neat trick if you can both sanction a country and partner with them at the same time,\u201d said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who worked for several Republican presidents. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not easy to keep the focus on Iran\u2019s behavior when the Saudis are doing terrible things to journalists and dissidents, and bombing children in Yemen.\u201dAfter a phone call with Prince Mohammed on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said the kingdom\u2019s rulers had again \u201ctotally denied any knowledge\u201d of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fate. He said the crown prince, who was with Mr. Pompeo during the call, would expand an investigation into Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance and suspected killing two weeks ago.Mr. Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post, has not been seen since he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. Turkish officials have asserted that Mr. Khashoggi was murdered and his body dismembered; Saudi officials denied any wrongdoing.While Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance has heightened tensions between Saudi Arabia and both Turkey and the United States, the White House has been measuring the damage to its Iran strategy.In interviews this week, Trump administration officials and outside experts said that possible repercussions on an elaborate plan to squeeze the Iranians have dominated internal discussions about the fallout over what happened to Mr. Khashoggi.On Nov. 5, the administration is expected to announce that any company that does business with Iran \u2014 buying oil, financing projects or investing in the country \u2014 will be prohibited from doing business in the United States, including clearing transactions in dollars. It would present a common front with the Saudis, and cast Iran as the source of almost all instability in the Middle East.That argument, officials have acknowledged, is now in jeopardy.Mr. Pompeo\u2019s message, officials said, was that a credible investigation and a Saudi explanation of what happened had to be conducted rapidly, before it imperiled the rest of the agenda that Mr. Trump and his lieutenants have devised with the kingdom.Other administration officials recently have been circulating through Riyadh, the Saudi capital, seeking the kingdom\u2019s help on familiar problems, be it Iraq, Afghanistan or the Islamic State. But it is the containment of Iran that has captivated the administration and its Saudi allies.Norman T. Roule, who oversaw Iran assessments for decades before he left the C.I.A. last year, said in an interview from Riyadh that \u201cthe Saudis need to quickly and transparently deal with this.\u201d\u201cBut then we and the Saudis need to get back to the business of restoring stability, confronting Iran and building a better Middle East,\u201d Mr. Roule said.That view is not shared by many in Congress, or among human rights groups, which believe that the Trump administration is so focused on Iran that it is willing to forgive Saudi actions that would be denounced as intolerable if they were committed by Iran.With international attention focused on the current discussions between Mr. Pompeo and the Saudi royals, the Trump administration announced on Tuesday a limited package of new sanctions \u2014 against Iran.It was part of an orchestrated effort by the administration to repeatedly denounce Iran and warn European businesses to sever all commercial ties with the country before Nov. 5.The penalties were issued against the Basij Resistance Force, an Iranian militia used to intimidate protesters. Officials who briefed journalists about the sanctions largely refused to answer questions about Mr. Khashoggi, despite a drumbeat of queries about Saudi Arabia, which one official termed a \u201clike-minded\u201d ally.Middle East experts said the goal for Mr. Trump and the Saudis was clear: Get the Saudi role in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance out of the headlines and focus anew on the Iranians.\u201cI think they have a very strong incentive to cook up some story that will get us out of this fix,\u201d said Gary Samore, the director of the Crown Center for Middle East Studies at Brandeis University, and a former top White House aide on nuclear issues for President Barack Obama.\u201cThey can\u2019t go with the story that M.B.S. ordered a rendition of Khashoggi,\u201d said Mr. Samore, using the initials for the crown prince. \u201cSo they have to find another credible story, and a rendition-gone-bad, or a rogue operation, might be it.\u201dBut the key issue motivating the administration, he noted, is the close coordination needed with the Saudis as the crackdown on Iran unfolds. The result is that just as Congress talks about economic or military sanctions against the Saudi government, the country\u2019s oil revenue may actually rise, as it picks up business previously filled by Iran.Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and formerly a strong advocate of Saudi Arabia, has been among the most outspoken critics of the crown prince over the Khashoggi disappearance.\u201cHe had this guy murdered in the consulate in Turkey,\u201d Mr. Graham said Tuesday on the \u201cFox & Friends\u201d news program.\u201cI\u2019m not going back to Saudi Arabia as long as this guy\u2019s in charge,\u201d Mr. Graham said, suggesting the king remove the crown prince from power. \u201cThis guy is a wrecking ball.\u201dTo penalize what the Saudis care about most \u2014 oil revenue \u2014 would be to undercut the Iran policy and send the price of gasoline and heating oil significantly higher, just as winter approaches.\u201cIran\u2019s leaders \u2014 especially those at the top of the I.R.G.C., such as Qasem Soleimani, the head of the Quds Force \u2014 must be made to feel the painful consequences of their violence and corruption,\u201d Mr. Pompeo wrote, referring to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. \u201cGiven that the regime is controlled by a desire for self-enrichment and a revolutionary ideology from which it will not easily depart, sanctions must be severe if they are to change entrenched habits.\u201dHe continued: \u201cThat\u2019s why the Trump administration is reimposing U.S. sanctions that were lifted or waived as part of the nuclear deal; the first of these went back into effect on Aug. 7, with the remainder coming back on Nov. 5. We intend to get global imports of Iranian crude oil as close to zero as possible by Nov. 4.\u201dThe article makes only one reference to Saudi Arabia \u2014 as a country that is the target of Iranian-made missiles.An earlier version of this article misstated the date that the United States will reimpose sanctions on Iranian oil exports. It is Nov. 5, not Nov. 4.Gardiner Harris and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Macron, With Popularity Slumping, Tries Tax Cuts for France\u2019s Working Class", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnd then there was the encounter with the gardener.That is hardly the vision of France, or of his presidency, that Mr. Macron hoped for when he swept into office 18 months ago with a pledge to revitalize Europe\u2019s third-biggest economy by pursuing work-force reforms that had been stalled for more than a decade.His approval ratings have slumped, and on Wednesday his interior minister resigned, the third cabinet member to quit in six weeks. Amid the turmoil, the government is trying to shore up support by giving cash back to the working class \u2014 with tax breaks next year worth 6 billion euros ($6.9 billion) for middle- and low-income earners \u2014 while reassuring investors that his designs for a \u201cnew French prosperity\u201d are on track.\u201cBut French people are skeptical,\u201d Mr. Le Maire told reporters last week. \u201cWe need to explain that this new model will be successful, and that it takes time before seeing the full benefits.\u201dIf convincing French voters is an uphill battle, it is especially challenging for Mr. Macron, who is viewed internationally as a dynamic European leader. His policies at home have yet to help most households.Mr. Macron promised voters that he could whittle unemployment to 7 percent by the next presidential election in 2022. To meet that target, the economy would have to grow by at least 1.7 percent in each of the next four years, which is by no means certain, according to the French Economic Observatory.The budget is aimed at \u201cmaking work pay\u201d by leaving more money in workers\u2019 pockets. But to keep the deficit in check, Mr. Macron is also trimming benefits for those not working, and cutting over 40,000 jobs in the public sector.Increases in pensions and family benefits would be capped at 0.3 percent a year, well below the 1.8 percent annual average inflation rate. Although 300,000 pensioners who make less than \u20ac1,200 a month will be exempted, many older voters are angry about those cuts and are taking to the streets in protest. There are 15 million pensioners in France, and three out of four voted for Mr. Macron in the second round of balloting.Yet even the business community has been grousing about Mr. Macron\u2019s changes. Some companies are upset about the government\u2019s plans to limit the use of short-term contracts, arguing that the policy ignores the needs of the modern workplace. Employers relied on short-term contracts during the financial crisis. The sort of innovative industry that France now seeks \u2014 whether digital or manufacturing-based \u2014 needs agile and fluid workers, business groups contend.Mr. Macron took pains on a tour of the French Antilles last weekend to appear more down to earth, glad-handing the public and standing in the rain for selfies with smiling crowds. \u201cI\u2019m not perfect. There are things that need to be corrected,\u201d he told the French newspaper Le Monde.He also remains adamant that his approach will benefit younger voters \u2014 including the 25-year-old gardener who couldn\u2019t find work. Mr. Macron listened to his complaint that horticulture jobs were hard to find and gave a rapid-fire response: Be flexible.\u201cIf you\u2019re willing and motivated, in hotels, cafes and restaurants, construction, there\u2019s not a single place I go where they don\u2019t say they\u2019re looking for people. Not one \u2014 it\u2019s true!\u201d Mr. Macron told the man.The French president is \u201ctaking a gamble,\u201d said \u00c9ric Heyer, the director of analysis and forecasting at the French Economic Observatory. \u201cBy easing taxes on the middle class, he\u2019s trying to get away from this image that he\u2019s \u2018president of the rich.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe measures will either deepen inequality or help growth,\u201d Mr. Heyer added. \u201cBut nothing is guaranteed to be a success, so it is unclear if he will win or lose the bet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They have stocked their ranks with experienced dealmakers and are searching for opportunities to strike their own deals.\u201cThey\u2019ve evolved into becoming more direct investors,\u201d Michael Maduell, the president of the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, a research group. \u201cThey are competing more against the Carlyles and the Blackstones of the world.\u201dGovernments have long needed ways to invest their surplus cash, particularly those nations whose petroleum reserves gushed money. Sovereign funds offered one way to deploy that capital to generate income for decades to come.Such funds hold vast sums of money: roughly $7.8 trillion as of June 30, according to data from the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. The biggest in the world, Norway\u2019s Global Pension Fund, manages just over $1 trillion, or more than double what Blackstone oversees.Early on, many of these funds placed money with professional money managers. But starting a decade ago, some government funds began to assert themselves as direct investors.Their ambitions have continued to grow in the years since the financial crisis. The 10 biggest deals by such funds were all struck within the past decade, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute. The biggest on record, Blackstone\u2019s sale of the warehouse operator Logicor to the China Investment Corporation, was for roughly $14 billion.To help hunt down opportunities, many of the funds have built up their in-house investment teams, hiring experienced rainmakers from top international banks and private equity firms.From 2012 to 2016, for example, Temasek\u2019s head of the Americas was Boon Sim, who had been Credit Suisse\u2019s head of global mergers and acquisitions. During the past year, the P.I.F. has hired Alireza Zaimi, a senior banker at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Abdulmajeed Alhagbani, who led HSBC\u2019s Saudi asset management team.To attract top managers, some of these funds have offered compensation packages competitive with Goldman Sachs and K.K.R., a far cry from the salaries normally paid for what are essentially civil-servant positions.There are a number of factors behind sovereign funds\u2019 push to make direct investments.One is simple: These funds are awash in money, more than what professional investment firms can put to work.\u201cThe key driver for them is that they want to invest privately more than what private equity firms allow them to do,\u201d said Francesco Rossi Ferrini, the head of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s sovereign wealth funds advisory team for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Striking deals directly also helps sovereign funds save on fees charged by money managers.A month after Mr. Musk\u2019s scandal broke, the P.I.F. announced its investment in Lucid.Advertisement"}

A large number of Indians wondered why Aadhaar was being made mandatory and why the federal officials insisted the data collected through the program was safe despite evidence to the contrary. The Supreme Court\u2019s judgment barring companies from seeking Aadhaar numbers is likely to lull the Indian middle class into believing that it has won and to slow down the movement against the invasive nature of Aadhaar and the government\u2019s attitude toward privacy and surveillance in general. Hours after the judgment, Arun Jaitley, India\u2019s finance minister, told reporters that it would be wrong to assume that sections struck down in the judgment \u201care perpetually prohibited.\u201d The government argued that Aadhaar enabled it to subvert fraud in the delivery of welfare, curb money laundering, thwart terrorism and achieve efficiency.

After the judgment, Nikhil Dey, a labor rights and information rights activist who challenged the project in court, gave voice to longstanding frustrations of economists, activists and researchers who work in villages when he wished that Aadhaar \u201chad been made mandatory for something that affected the middle class the way the poor have been affected for the last four to five years.\u201dThe idea of Indians identifying themselves to participate online is a dangerous one.

The two men represent radically different visions for Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth-largest democracy, where leftists have won the presidency in every election since 2002.However strongly Mr. Bolsonaro performed on Sunday, he remains an extremely divisive figure who alienated large segments of Brazil\u2019s highly diverse population during the campaign.But political analysts said Sunday night that Mr. Haddad faces a daunting task in the second round to rally a majority of Brazilians to his side.Laura Carvalho, an economist at University of S\u00e3o Paulo, said the best bet for the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s candidate would be to focus on pocketbook issues over the next three weeks. \u201cInstead of focusing on racism and misogyny, which did not have much effect, they should focus on the economic agenda and the anti-worker aspect of the Bolsonaro candidacy,\u201d Ms. Carvalho said.While several of Brazil\u2019s neighbors have steered to the right politically in recent years, a victory by Mr. Bolsonaro, a populist conservative who stands to join a growing roster of anti-establishment leaders around the world, would be a seismic conservative shift.Critics of Mr. Bolsonaro and political analysts have watched his rise with alarm, fearing he could become an authoritarian leader in the mold of Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines.Rejected by mainstream parties, Mr. Bolsonaro struggled to find a running mate until early August, when he picked a recently retired general who has advocated military intervention as a means to purge a corrupt ruling elite. He has said he intends to appoint other military leaders to central roles.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s first-round victory was all the more remarkable because he lacked the backing of a major party and campaigned on a shoestring budget, relying mainly on social media to build a base. As of mid-September, the Bolsonaro campaign reported having spent about $235,000, a small fraction of the $6.3 million the Haddad campaign disclosed having spent.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s rise was enabled by the political divisions that have torn the country apart in recent years.Brazilians were outraged as leaders of the traditional parties become ensnared in an ever-widening corruption investigation that began in 2014 and became ever more despondent as the economy sputtered, joblessness grew and crime soared.While some voters remained loyal to the Workers\u2019 Party \u2014 which governed from 2003 to 2016 \u2014 for its efforts to improve the lives of poor and working-class Brazilians, many came to hold it responsible for the graft and economic hardship of recent years.Georgewlany Smith, a 61-year-old public servant in Rio de Janeiro, said that an erosion of democratic norms and civil liberties is a price he is willing to pay for a more secure and prosperous Brazil.\u201cYou have to consider what were the best times for Brazil,\u201d Mr. Smith said shortly after he voted for Mr. Bolsonaro in the upscale Barra de Tijuca district. \u201cUnfortunately it was the dictatorship.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro has tapped into the simmering anger and desire for disruption of the status quo that has gripped many Brazilians. And he became the face of a growing conservative movement in a nation where evangelicals account for one in four voters and more than 90 federal lawmakers.The candidate offered little in the way of a detailed policy road map \u2014 particularly regarding the country\u2019s floundering economy. When pressed with questions, he offered up Paulo Guedes, a market-friendly economist he said he would appoint as finance minister to curtail the social spending that grew under the Workers\u2019 Party.The markets rallied as he took the lead in polls \u2014 but Mr. Bolsonaro is \u201cnot the pro-market liberal he pretends to be,\u201d warned Monica de Bolle, a Brazilian economist who heads the Latin American Studies Program at Johns Hopkins University.\u201cHe really stands out for having overly simplistic solutions to very complex problems, a characteristic that will certainly backfire,\u201d she said.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s victory will most likely be denounced by many on the left as the undemocratic outcome of an election that excluded the towering politician in recent Brazilian history: former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a rousing former steelworker and union leader who rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s opposing the military dictatorship.Mr. da Silva, who served two terms and left office in 2011 with a record-high approval rating, was the front-runner for much of the past year and appeared well positioned to return to the presidential palace. But he became ineligible to run for office after an appeals court early this year upheld a corruption and money laundering conviction against him.Mr. Haddad, 55, who comes across as an earnest intellectual and lacks Mr. da Silva\u2019s fiery charisma, was unknown in much of the country and failed to galvanize core Workers\u2019 Party voters who had identified with Mr. da Silva\u2019s working-class roots and life story.Some voters remain fiercely loyal to Mr. da Silva, though.Anita Silva Lima, a 38-year-old waitress who lives in Rocinha, a low-income neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, said on Sunday morning that she and her seven immediate relatives had voted for \u201cLula\u2019s candidate,\u201d resisting pressure from her boss, who urged her to back Mr. Bolsonaro.\u201cI don\u2019t want a dictatorship \u2014 a lot of people died then,\u201d said Ms. Lima, who is originally from the impoverished northeast, a Workers\u2019 Party stronghold. \u201cI don\u2019t care about this corruption talk. Tell me the name of a politician who doesn\u2019t steal? Bolsonaro steals, too.\u201dOthers have lost faith in the Workers\u2019 Party and feel the current race leaves them with no good options.\u201cThey are all the same,\u201d said Carlos Alberto da Silva, a 59-year-old driver in Rio de Janeiro who supported the Workers\u2019 Party in 2014 and said he intended to signal his frustration by spoiling his ballot this year.Among the striking surprises of Sunday\u2019s election was the defeat of former President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers\u2019 Party, who was running for the Senate. Public opinion polls had suggested she would easily win a seat in her home state of Minas Gerais, but Ms. Rousseff came in fourth.Clara Ara\u00fajo, a sociologist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said voters showed a strong disdain for the dominant political factions on Sunday.\u201cThe dissatisfaction over the economic crisis, it seems to me, was channeled along with a discourse about conservative morals,\u201d she said. Those who voted for Mr. Bolsonaro, she said, saw him as \u201cthe option for a certain order, a certain stability, even if this notion was based on easy ways out.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro warned voters that returning the Workers\u2019 Party to power would perpetuate a culture of graft that has been exposed in recent years and has tainted every large political party and several of the country\u2019s top companies.He also contended that under leftist rule, Brazil risked stumbling into an economic crisis like the one that has sparked a mass exodus in neighboring Venezuela.As most of his dozen rivals traveled around the country and participated in debates, Mr. Bolsonaro largely sat out the final month of the race recovering in a hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo and later at his home in Rio de Janeiro.In recent days he has recorded daily videos broadcast live on Facebook weighing in on the news of the day. The unscripted, shaky clips were illustrative of a campaign that had an insurgent, improvisational feel from the start.As a Bolsonaro victory appeared increasingly likely, ardent opponents protested online and in the streets under the motto: #EleN\u00e3o, or Not Him, warning that the country\u2019s democratic institutions could be eroded.But influential evangelical and agribusiness lobbies rallied to his side in the final stretch, while investors and wealthy Brazilians backed him, believing that Mr. Bolsonaro would curtail social spending and implement market-friendly reforms.Outside Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s beachfront apartment in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday night, supporters sang the national anthem and chanted \u201cthe captain has arrived\u201d as the first results showed him winning by a large margin.\u201cGetting rid of the P.T. alone is not a solution, but it\u2019s a first step toward fixing the country,\u201d said Barbara Laureano, a 25-year-old business woman, referring to the Workers\u2019 Party. \u201cThis is not about him as a person, it\u2019s about an idea,\u201d she said.Lis Moriconi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "M.&.A. Bankers May Be Better Off Chasing Smaller Deals", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsAdvising on huge corporate mergers may be exhilarating, but the banking consiglieri may find that a focus on smaller deals offers more dependable success.While the number of deals above $10 billion is increasing, the benefits of advising on them aren\u2019t rising to match. So the challenge of closing larger transactions argues in favor of working on smaller mergers and acquisitions.In the first nine months of 2018, acquisitions of companies priced at over $10 billion have increased by more than 150 percent in dollar terms, according to data from Refinitiv. Helped by Comcast\u2019s bid for Sky, Marathon Petroleum\u2019s $23 billion outlay for Andeavor, and Keurig Green Mountain\u2019s deal to buy Dr Pepper Snapple, 39 deals worth almost a combined $1 trillion have been announced so far this year.Smaller deals have increased too, though not by as much. More than 13,000 deals with a value between $1 billion and $10 billion have been announced, amounting to a more than 100 percent increase in the dollar value over the same period in 2017.Big deals give firms bragging rights, so large banks tend to chase them. They can also bring chunky financing fees: see Comcast\u2019s $27 billion loan placement on Tuesday, led by Bank of America.But they also share the spoils, and the kudos, among a larger group. They are harder to close, too. So far this year the dollar value of withdrawn deals has increased 33 percent compared to the same period last year.Part of the problem is that regulators take time studying the small print when two companies of great size and stature come together. Broadcom\u2019s attempted $117 billion purchase of Qualcomm, which was ultimately blocked by the U.S. government, is a good example.Clients may glance at league tables, and big clients may also be swayed by large balance sheets. But there\u2019s a lot to be said for the ability to think up a smart deal and get it over the line \u2014 and for that, size isn\u2019t what counts.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Downturn Looms as Leadership Test for California, World\u2019s 5th Largest Economy", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia is an economic powerhouse \u2014 now the fifth largest economy in the world after surpassing the United Kingdom in total output this year.But this state may be facing a financial reckoning at the very moment that Jerry Brown is stepping down as governor: a possible recession coinciding with deepening concerns about its fiscal stability. His two potential successors \u2014 Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor, and John Cox, a Republican business executive \u2014 have significantly less experience than Mr. Brown, a fixture in California for nearly a half a century and through five national recessions.California is now on the verge of putting one of the world\u2019s largest economies in the hands of a relatively untested governor.The ability of Mr. Brown\u2019s successor to navigate California through challenging fiscal times could be critical to assuring both the state\u2019s continuing economic durability and its outsize contribution to national prosperity.\u201cSo goes California, so goes the U.S.,\u201d said Christopher Thornberg, the founding partner of Beacon Economics, a consulting firm in Los Angeles. \u201cIt is far and away a dominant source of job growth in the U.S.\u201dAmid all its successes, California has become a stark example of economic disparity, illustrated by the juxtaposition of homes selling for tens of millions of dollars in the hills of Los Angeles and colonies of tents a few miles away along Sunset Boulevard. A disproportionate amount of this state\u2019s wealth is being generated in the Bay Area, where an explosion of new tech companies has produced jobs with six- and seven-digit salaries. In Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley, average pay tops $130,000 per year.A severe lack of affordable housing has fueled concern by business and political leaders of a labor shortage, because there will be no place middle-class people can afford to live. \u201cWe are going to have a two-million-person gap in about 20 years,\u201d said Anthony Rendon, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly. \u201cI can see that getting bigger if we can\u2019t figure out the housing crisis.\u201dPolicies embraced by President Trump \u2014 including tariffs on Chinese goods and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants \u2014 could be harmful to this state\u2019s economy, home to a vast network of farms already struggling to find field workers, and to the nation\u2019s two largest ports.The tax bill enacted by Congress is raising the cost of living for many homeowners by limiting the deductibility of state and local taxes, which are high in California, though some have done better under the new code. A drive to repeal a gas tax, on the ballot this fall, could undercut Mr. Brown\u2019s ambitious effort to rebuild roads and bridges and blast a hole in the next governor\u2019s budget.And by nearly every account, a national recession is overdue. Another economic downturn could be especially devastating to this state, with a tax system heavily reliant on high-income wage earners. The last one resulted in the loss of one million jobs across the state.\u201cJerry Brown has warned of the chances some headwinds on the economy coming down the pike are pretty high \u2014 we are not prepared for that,\u201d said Austin Beutner, a former Wall Street investment banker and deputy mayor of Los Angeles, who is the superintendent of the Los Angeles school district. \u201cWe haven\u2019t modernized the tax base and reformed the property tax system. We haven\u2019t done the hard work to make sure if there is a change or a correction, the resources are there to do the things the state has to do.\u201dMr. Newsom and Mr. Cox have both spoken of the huge economic challenges facing the state, pointing to widespread poverty and homelessness that both men \u2014 invoking the same phrase \u2014 say, \u201chappened on our watch.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Their responses reflect their political philosophies. Mr. Cox has called for cuts in taxes and regulations, while Mr. Newsom has advocated increased spending on early childhood development, higher education and health care. But both Mr. Newsom and Mr. Cox have steered clear on offering detailed plans on how they might manage one of the world\u2019s most powerful economies.\u201cThe California Dream is predicated on upward mobility and the upward mobility cannot exist if people can\u2019t afford to live here,\u201d Mr. Newsom said in an interview. \u201cThe issues that are highlighted in terms of how we are not performing are legit. The richest and the poorest state. It has to be addressed.\u201dMr. Cox, in contrast to Mr. Brown and Mr. Newsom, said he did not think a recession was necessarily in the state\u2019s near future. Still, he described California as a place that had become increasingly difficult to live in.\u201cThe economy has grown,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnd it has obviously helped people at the top. And everyone is working, the unemployment rate is pretty low. But people can\u2019t make it here. And a lot of people are thinking of moving.\u201d\u201cWhat Governor Brown has done is try to maintain a certain amount of fiscal discipline in his party, which I don\u2019t see the next Democratic governor doing,\u201d said Juliet Musso, a professor of state government at the University of Southern California. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a lot of talk about fiscal reform, and that\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to play with the base he has been speaking to.\u201dMr. Newsom said he would prove to be as much of a fiscal steward as Mr. Brown. \u201cI think people, to the extent they are concerned, I think they\u2019ll be soon assuaged of that concern,\u201d he said.But in the same interview, he said he would push to restore cuts in early childhood education and higher education that took place under Mr. Brown. He has also called for a statewide single-payer health care system. \u201cIt\u2019s time to guarantee prenatal care, in-home nurse visits, and access to quality pre-K for every child in California,\u201d he said in his latest television advertisement.California\u2019s economy is a colossus, with a diverse set of industries that is unmatched in the United States. There is Silicon Valley in the Bay Area, which has become a dominant economic driver in the state. The farms that blanket the state\u2019s vast center grow two-thirds of the nation\u2019s fruits and nuts. The entertainment industry is still thriving in Hollywood (or more accurately, across Los Angeles.) And Southern California is home to two ports that receive nearly 40 percent of all foreign goods shipped into the country, plus a sprawling warehouse and transportation network needed to distribute them across the country.This state has accounted for 20 percent of the nation\u2019s economic growth since the end of the Great Recession. Unemployment is at a historic low. And after struggling under a $26 billion deficit, the state has a budget surplus of nearly $16 billion.But at the same time, the gap between the richest and poorest is wider here than almost anywhere in the country. California\u2019s poverty rate, at 19 percent, is the highest of any state.The state\u2019s ability to finance its operations has been complicated by two powerful forces. The first is Proposition 13, an initiative passed by voters in 1978 that imposed caps on property taxes. The second is its income tax system, which is volatile because it is heavily reliant on the top 1 percent of income tax payers. About 70 percent of the state\u2019s revenues come from personal income tax.There has been a clamor to change Proposition 13 \u2014 which would likely require another voter initiative \u2014 and to rewrite the income tax system to make it more reliable. But Mr. Brown was governor when Proposition 13 was passed in 1978 and it was a searing experience for him: He campaigned against it, but quickly moved to embrace it after voters rebuffed him.Over these past eight years, he has refrained from tackling either Proposition 13 or the state tax system, making it clear he saw both as losing battles.If Mr. Brown, who enjoyed abundant political capital and good will, was not willing to take on the fight, it seems unlikely that Mr. Newsom or Mr. Cox are going to step into that ring. \u201cIt\u2019s not politically popular to say let\u2019s try to have a less progressive income tax system,\u201d Professor Musso said.Both Mr. Newsom and Mr. Cox said they agreed the tax system needed to be reformed, but have resisted offering detailed ideas on how they would enter such politically complicated terrain.Mr. Cox for example, said he would look for \u201cother sources of revenue.\u201d When asked for examples, he responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I\u2019d be more insistent on cutting the spending. I think this state wastes incredible amounts of money.\u201dThe revamp of the tax code enacted by Congress could prove damaging to California if wealthy people start fleeing to lower-tax states. \u201cThe difference between California and other states is now much larger, and we have no idea of how people are going to react to that,\u201d said Irena Asmundson, the chief economist at the California Department of Finance.But the next governor will have one advantage that Mr. Brown did not. Mr. Brown pressed the Legislature, as the economy recovered, to create a rainy-day fund to carry the state through an economic downturn \u2014 a buffer against the kind of cuts imposed eight years ago. There is now $14 billion in the fund.Toni G. Atkins, the Democratic president pro tem of the State Senate, applauded the creation of the fund, but noted that it was dwarfed by the size of the deficit the state faced during the last recession.\u201cThat amount of money doesn\u2019t go as far as you think,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know what it felt like to go through a decade of serious recession. We had a really hard time. I am part of a last class of legislators who came here when we faced a $26 billion deficit. Those who came after us may feel somewhat different. They didn\u2019t have to make $26 billion in cuts.\u201dAdvertisement"}
