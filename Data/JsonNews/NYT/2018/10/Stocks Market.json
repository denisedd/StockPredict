{"Headline": "On Wall Street, the Bond Market Sets the Tone", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe rise in yields is a double-edged sword. It reflects optimism about the economy, but also gives traders reasons to worry.The bond market dominated the conversation on Wall Street this week as yields on benchmark Treasury bonds, which help determine interest rates for borrowers ranging from first-time home buyers to international corporations, steadily rose to seven-year highs.But as rates rise, borrowing will also become more expensive for consumers and companies, potentially slowing growth. Higher rates also change the balance of risk and reward for investors in other markets. Reflecting this, stocks fell, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ending the week down more than 1 percent. The idea that growth will push interest rates higher, only for higher rates to slow things down again, reflects the cyclical nature of the economy. Right now, rates are somewhere in between \u2014 not high enough to hurt growth, but rising and making some investors wary as they do. Here\u2019s what to make of it all.The economyGovernment bonds are known as safe haven investments. People buy them, instead of riskier investments like stocks, corporate debt and commodities, because they\u2019re worried about something: the economy, war, politics, you name it. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices, so yields fall during such rough patches. Since the financial crisis hit a decade ago, yields have been pretty low. The yield on the 10-year note has spent much of the past decade below 3 percent. (The low point was under 1.4 percent in July 2016.) Those yields prevailed even as the American economy recovered. That\u2019s partly because the Federal Reserve took extraordinary steps to try to nurse the economy back to health. But it also reflected lingering doubts among investors about the expansion. Even recently, plenty of investors have doubted whether the economy could grow as a trade war erupted.But grow it has, with gross domestic product expanding at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter, and even some glass-half-empty types are becoming convinced that a recession isn\u2019t in the cards any time soon. So yields are rising. \u201cBig picture, the economy is very strong,\u201d said Tim High, an interest rate strategist at BNP Paribas in New York. \u201cThe employment market remains very strong.\u201dIn fact, the worry has now switched to whether that growth will start to run too hot, leading to faster inflation and pushing the Fed to raise interest rates faster than it would like. For now, High said, that isn\u2019t something to worry about \u2014 which means investors should be spared any nasty economic surprises. The FutureIn the United States, we rely on a lot of debt to fuel the economy. And when the cost of that debt rises, it can drag on growth. We\u2019re about to find out how heavy that weight will be. As we\u2019ve said, for much of the last decade, long-term interest rates \u2014 which are essentially set by the Treasury market \u2014 have been quite low. Now rising rates are pulling other key borrowing costs higher. Rates on conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are above 4.7 percent, the highest level since 2011. Likewise, interest rates on 48-month new car loans have risen to more than 5 percent. They hadn\u2019t been that high since 2012, according to the most recent data from the Fed. Traditionally, cars and houses play a big role in the consumption-driven American economy. And if there\u2019s a weak spot in the otherwise strong economy, it could be in these interest-sensitive sectors. Sales of existing homes have slipped in recent months. They were flat in August, and are down 1.5 percent from the previous year. Automakers have reported steep declines in sales in September. Part of that decline reflected hurricanes that caused flooding in the Carolinas. But higher interest rates and rising car prices are also pushing some buyers toward the used car market. The Stock MarketWe often talk about financial markets \u2014 stocks, corporate debt, government bonds, commodities \u2014 as if they existed in complete isolation from one another. They don\u2019t.Changes in one can often have large effects on another. If oil prices fall, for example, that\u2019s obviously going to pinch the earnings of the companies that pump oil and refine gasoline. That will affect the stock prices of those companies, and the stock market as a whole.Likewise, higher yields on government bonds can have a subtle, but important, impact on the stock market. As rates move higher, they can persuade more and more people who\u2019ve ridden the nearly decade-long bull market in stocks to take some of their winnings off the table and sock them away in government bonds.Eventually, that could start to take the wind out of the stock market\u2019s sails.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Foretelling the Future of Oil", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat is the future of oil?It\u2019s hard if not impossible to say for sure, but there are few more important questions, since the answer will be a key guide to the fate of humanity over the next century.It\u2019s worth speculating about because the climate will depend on it, with the burning of gasoline and diesel key drivers for global warming. The balance of international power is also in play, with the future fortunes of such foes as Russia and Iran tied to the commodity. Huge fortunes could be made or lost from any shifts in the energy economy, which is currently controlled by some of the largest private and state corporations in the world.Predicting the energy sources of the future has always been a fool\u2019s game. In the 1950s, nuclear energy was supposed to promise cheap power for all but is now in eclipse. Biofuels seemed to hold great promise a decade ago, but now are little more than an afterthought. When most experts thought the country\u2019s oil reserves were in decline, shale drilling unleashed a boom in natural gas and oil production that now seems to perpetuate the dependence on fossil fuels except coal.A plan by Norway\u2019s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund to divest of $40 billion in oil stocks is meeting reluctance from within the government.\u201cThe demand for oil continues to grow even as there is an increased focus on controlling emissions and addressing the climate agenda,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian and author of \u201cThe Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power.\u201d But he added that he would not discount an eventual change in the direction of energy markets, even while it is \u201cdifficult to predict a breakthrough that perhaps is now unimaginable. The big change may be a merger of Silicon Valley and Houston.\u201dBig oil is beginning to hedge its bets on the future, under pressure from activist investors and the public, while also worrying about future regulation. A pivot may be starting, with ExxonMobil and BP engineers working on advanced batteries, Royal Dutch Shell scientists working on hydrogen fuel cells, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund investing in Tesla, and the oil industry broadly deploying artificial intelligence, robotics and faster data processing throughout their operations.Many experts remain skeptical that oil companies will be at the forefront of change and undercut their own businesses. Regardless of who leads the change away from oil \u2014 if there indeed is a change \u2014 there are already growing signs that global demand for oil will peak and decline to some degree by the late 2030s.That would not be fast enough for the world to achieve the goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-Industrial Age levels. Still, it would mark one of the most remarkable economic swings of the last century, given that global demand for oil has more than tripled since 1965.In what may be a sign of things to come, India has announced that by 2030, all new cars sold in the country will be electric.Norwegian risk-management firm DNV GL raised eyebrows across the oil industry in September by forecasting that demand for crude will crest in the early 2020s.Most of the major oil companies are counting on petrochemicals and plastics to continue to drive oil profits. They also hope the natural gas they produce and ship will continue to replace coal burning for electricity generation.Not surprisingly, oil executives typically scoff at the notion of a world without oil.Mr. Sealock and many other oil executives do not deny that climate change is an issue, nor that it is caused by the burning of fossil fuels.He points to technology as the solution that will allow societies to continue burning them safely, noting efforts by the billionaire investor Bill Gates and others to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through advanced industrial-scale engineering.Mr. Sealock and a few other oil executives see the possibility that natural gas, which frequently bubbles up with oil from the same wells, could provide the raw material for the production of hydrogen for fuel cells that would limit the exhaust of cars to drops of water.That may all be wishful thinking on the part of Mr. Sealock, who is managing a company that is attempting to unlock billions of new barrels of oil. If he is right, that could be a convenient solution not only for the climate (unless there are unintended negative consequences to fiddling with the atmosphere as some fear), but also for a slew of countries that rely on oil for their economic well-being across much of Africa and the Middle East, as well as Russia, Mexico and emerging producers like Brazil and Guyana.But there is another view, decidedly a minority one still, that believes the days of the fossil fuel age are numbered. One such futurist is Dieter Helm, an Oxford University energy economist and author of \u201cBurn Out: The Endgame for Fossil Fuels,\u201d published last year, who says he believes that the world is poised for a technological transformation that will produce new sources of power, advanced energy storage and a rise in the efficiency of the economy so less energy is needed.\u201cWe know the supply of solar is infinite,\u201d Mr. Helm said. And in the next 20 years, he added, \u201cWe\u2019ll have factories that run on robots, we\u2019ll have 3-D printing, artificial intelligence and so on that will make energy demand remarkably more flexible in factories, offices and houses too.\u201dSuch technologies are already taking hold, and in Mr. Helm\u2019s view they will speed up as global leaders are forced to manage the impacts of climate change, which appear to be accelerating. It\u2019s not going to immediately happen, but he says he believes the big oil companies will eventually go the way of the horse and buggy.\u201cWhy do you think Exxon is better at battery or new storage technology than a start up?\u201d he said. \u201cJust like the Telcos didn\u2019t take over the internet world, they will try, they will do a bit, but I think very gradually they will decay.\u201dSome oil company executives say they are accepting the challenge of a lower carbon world, and they are ready to adapt.One of the leaders is Eldar Saetre, chief executive of the Norwegian oil giant Equinor, whose company is a pioneer in offshore wind power.While Equinor has acknowledged that it will have to leave some hydrocarbons in the ground, Mr. Saetre said his industry is going to have to adjust faster.\u201cThere are companies that could do more,\u201d Mr. Saetre said, choosing his words carefully.\u201cI see a lot of players with a conscious and aggressive approach, but it\u2019s an evolution and there is room for more engagement in our industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Stocks Became Expensive. Are Other Countries Better Bets?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 6.7 percent decline in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in six trading sessions through Thursday nearly erased the 7.2 percent gain the index recorded in the third quarter. The market rebounded a bit on Friday. But even before the six-day plunge, the narrowness of the quarter\u2019s advance hinted that the market was on shakier ground than the peak reached in the period might have suggested.The strong performance during the quarter was concentrated in American stocks, primarily of a handful of big-name technology companies, such as Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Markets fell almost everywhere else.The gap between stock returns in the United States and elsewhere has led some \u2014 but definitely not all \u2014 strategists to conclude that for American investors, there are better prospects abroad.\u201cThe U.S. is an expensive, frothy market priced to give you terrible forward returns,\u201d said Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, who is seeking opportunities in foreign markets.On the other hand, Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said the outperformance of the American market was justified \u2014 and may well continue. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world, and between the U.S. market and the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest of the developed world has half as much growth, and it\u2019s the same with profits. It\u2019s a legitimate divergence. It\u2019s not solely a matter of sentiment.\u201dLegitimate or not, the divergence between foreign and domestic markets \u2014 and how much they cost \u2014 accelerated in recent months. The Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-U.S. exchange-traded fund was down 4.9 percent in the year through September, while the SPDR S.&P. 500 E.T.F. rose 8.9 percent, helped by a 7.2 percent increase in the underlying index in the third quarter. Based on the ratio of share prices to book value, American stocks were more than twice as expensive in September as stocks in the rest of the world, according to Bank of America, a record premium.Leading the laggards downward were emerging markets, several of which have plunged because of heavy amounts of foreign debt, and Europe, where indexes are heavily weighted in banks that are owed a lot of that money.The comparative strength of domestic stocks has been justified by the superior performance of the American economy and the presence of so many high-quality, high-growth companies, investment advisers like Mr. Golub say. Others, like Mr. Arnott, counter that American business prospects cannot be marvelous enough to justify such a cavernous valuation discrepancy, especially over the medium-to-long haul. Foreign markets, especially in the developing world, are bound to bounce back and reward the patience of investors who take a chance on them, they say.Mr. Arnott, for example, highlighted an array of measures showing that American stocks are expensive when compared with their own history or with foreign alternatives, especially in the developing world.\u201cEmerging market stocks are cheap,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been whacked because of fears that a trade war will do these economies great damage.\u201d With valuations at half the levels of American stocks\u2019, he said, \u201cthey\u2019re reflecting the worst case, not the most likely case.\u201dBonds issued in the developing world also offer good value, in his view. Debt denominated in local currencies yields 6 percent or more, double what long-term Treasury issues offer.Yet emerging market assets may not seem like bargains to anyone familiar with the currency collapses and economic difficulties besetting countries like Turkey and Argentina. Lower stock prices or an extra three or four points of yield may be small compensation for the possibility of further currency losses or the added risk of default.But those countries account for a minuscule fraction of emerging stock and bond markets. Other places are on more solid economic and financial footing, although it might take a while before recognition sets in that they\u2019re still moving in the right direction.\u201cThe emerging market story is intact, but you have to have a longer-term focus; emerging markets are still not for the faint of heart,\u201d said Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants. \u201cThe best bets in these markets continue to be the ones growing strongly.\u201dStrong, persistent economic growth, propelled in part by young, rising populations, can overcome occasional bouts of weakness in mature economies, policy errors at home, large foreign debts and other unfavorable conditions, she said.Indonesia, for instance, one of her favorite markets, runs large fiscal and current-account deficits, Ms. Morrissey said. The country owes a lot of money to foreign lenders, and its currency, the rupiah, is trading near where it was during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, but economic growth is at a five-year high.India, another favorite, also runs large deficits and has a weak currency. On top of that, India is \u201cmassively oil reliant,\u201d she said. But its economy grew at an 8.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, driven by the country\u2019s dynamic private sector.\u201cThere are still significant portions of the populations in these countries striving for an iPhone,\u201d Ms. Morrissey said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a significant growth story.\u201dThe arguments for investing in the United States are strong, too.

American stock indexes are heavily weighted toward technology companies, while European indexes have a larger proportion of banks, which have been struggling in part because of their extensive exposure to lenders in the developing world.Fund returns in the third quarter confirmed the outperformance but not by as much as you might expect from the moves in the underlying assets. The average domestic stock fund rose 5 percent, according to Morningstar, led by portfolios specializing in health care, energy and technology. The average international fund gained 0.1 percent, depressed by losses in India and China funds.The average taxable bond fund returned 0.7 percent in the period.Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, also finds the discrepancy in investment returns justified.\u201cThe U.S. leadership this year is a reflection of diverging fundamentals in different parts of the world,\u201d she said. \u201cSignificant stimulus\u201d \u2014 from the Federal Reserve until recently and then from a big round of tax cuts \u2014 \u201chas helped lift corporate earnings. I\u2019m not surprised that the U.S. is outperforming by so much this year. I guess the question is: Can the outperformance last?\u201dIt\u2019s a tough one to answer in a world of interconnected economies. Some developments that would worsen conditions at home might cause even greater damage abroad, Ms. Patterson said, while favorable domestic developments might provide a greater lift elsewhere.If the Fed has second thoughts about monetary tightening and turns more dovish, for instance, it could depress the dollar, easing pressures on foreign economies with large debts denominated in dollars. \u201cThe rest of the world could catch up,\u201d she said.By contrast, an acceleration of the slow-motion trade war that has been worrying investors all year \u2014 although not enough to put much of a crimp in market returns \u2014 would hurt the domestic economy, but it could damp growth to a much greater extent in places like China, she said. A slowdown in China, in turn, would have a more serious impact on Europe than the United States.Another potential impediment to European markets, Ms. Patterson said, is the imminent start of a monetary tightening cycle by the European Central Bank. The Fed has been far more hawkish on inflation, but its European counterpart may soon join it in raising interest rates and selling assets acquired in its quantitative easing program.With such prospects, she prefers to maintain a particularly high allocation to domestic stocks. But favorable moves on the trade front would persuade her to put more into emerging markets, particularly China.Mr. Golub contends that investors have \u201calmost an obsession with what could go wrong\u201d for American stocks, although he acknowledged that \u201cif people were really cautious, the market wouldn\u2019t be going up\u201d as it did in the third quarter.He also highlighted a number of factors that are \u201ca risk but not a problem,\u201d including inflation, the elections next month and the trade backdrop. He said that valuations are not cheap and that long-term returns could suffer for that.\u201cThere is an unbelievable number of potential threats to the stock market, but none of them are derailing the market yet,\u201d Mr. Golub said.The last word in that quote might worry some investors, especially lately, but he recommends owning some of the highest of fliers, including technology stocks that focus on consumer services, such as Priceline and Amazon, and on communication services, including Netflix, Alphabet and Facebook. He also favors financial companies.If there are risks but not problems in the United States, as Mr. Golub put it, Nick Kaiser, manager of the Sextant International fund, finds problems but not as much risk overseas.\u201cThere are more opportunities in foreign markets than domestic,\u201d Mr. Kaiser said. Even a country like Argentina \u201cis a great place to invest,\u201d he said, as long as the money is put to work in stocks when they trade at low valuations, and not bonds, which are far more susceptible to inflation.His strategy is to look for high-quality companies, even if the quality of the economy in places where they do business may be suspect. An example in Argentina is MercadoLibre, an online retailer that operates across South America.Other portfolio holdings that Mr. Kaiser mentioned include Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, a French engineering company; Nice, an Israeli cybersecurity concern; and two Dutch businesses: the consumer electronics company Philips, and ASML Holding, a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\u201cWe see a lot of opportunities in Europe,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there may be more in Argentina and Brazil.\u201dMr. Arnott likewise sees a world full of healthy investment prospects. He finds it easier to list what he would avoid than what he would buy.\u201cThere\u2019s a richer spread of opportunity than usual, just not in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just need a little upside surprise and you\u2019ve got a bull market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Transformational Bliss of Borrowing Your Office Clothes", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "Rent the Runway\u2019s Unlimited service saves working women something more valuable than money: their time.Supported byOn a Friday morning in August, Sushma Dwivedi, a senior vice president at Edelman, the global marketing conglomerate, bustled around her Harlem apartment in a blue-and-white-striped cotton dress. With her toddler and newborn out with a nanny, Ms. Dwivedi, who was on maternity leave but preparing for a meeting with a senior colleague in a few days, intended to get some things done. High on her list: assessing the contents of a recently delivered dark-blue garment bag.Ms. Dwivedi, 37, is a member of Rent the Runway Unlimited, a service that, for $159 a month, allows subscribers to borrow up to four pieces of clothing and accessories from a designer-laden library of more than 450,000 items and keep them for as long as they want. If subscribers can\u2019t bear to part with something, they can buy it, generally for about half the retail price. (A cocoon-like wool cardigan from Jil Sander Navy sells in stores for $1,275, but costs $765 through Rent the Runway.) When members buy an item, or return it, via a prepaid shipping label in their garment bag, a spot for something new opens up.Though Rent the Runway was originally conceived as a solution for women who didn\u2019t want to invest in party-wear they might use only once, Unlimited has become a strategic solution for professional women such as Ms. Dwivedi, who manages 30 employees in Edelman\u2019s food and beverage department and regularly gets called into the offices of clients like Pepsi and Chobani.\u201cThe wardrobe thing, when I was trying to lose the baby weight, was frustrating,\u201d said Ms. Dwivedi, recalling her first pregnancy. \u201cI knew what I could buy when I was pregnant. I knew how big I was, but afterward, what was I going to do? Buy an entire wardrobe at five pounds thinner, five more pounds thinner, and on and on?\u201d She added, \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to look frumpy or have someone turn around and say, \u2018Wow, she looked a lot better before.\u2019\u201dSince Rent the Runway introduced Unlimited two years ago, the service has amassed tens of thousands of subscribers in part by promising to solve the problem of what to wear to work, for everyone from new hires to C-suite executives. (The company declined to confirm its user numbers, but analysts said that perhaps 50,000 people are active subscribers.) It is fast displacing the start-up\u2019s original business model. Rent the Runway was founded in 2009 as a way for people to borrow couture on an item-by-item basis. This year, Unlimited, which also has an $89-a-month tier, will account for the majority of revenue.\u201cI just have too much stuff: stuff that I bought, that I don\u2019t like anymore, that I don\u2019t wear anymore,\u201d said Kristin Lemkau, the chief marketing officer of JPMorgan Chase and a self-described Unlimited \u201csuperfan\u201d of two years. On a recent Wednesday morning at her office, on the 36th floor of a glossy Park Avenue monolith, she wore a flouncy, frilly black dress sprayed with pastel-colored daisies. Lemkau, 51, who helps oversee a $5 billion budget, routinely speaks at conferences on her firm\u2019s behalf, sometimes in places like the South of France or the Swiss Alps, which come with their own, rarefied dress codes.Before signing up for Unlimited, she regularly met with a wardrobe consultant near her Rye, N.Y., home. \u201cI\u2019d go to her house and pick out stuff,\u201d Ms. Lemkau said. \u201cI was never thrilled with the clothes. It was the same old black dress and black pants, and I started looking like I was in mourning all the time.\u201dShe ruffled her daisy-printed hem. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve bought this, but it\u2019s super cute, it\u2019s fun. I look forward to getting dressed every day instead of, \u2018What thing am I going to wear? Is my dry cleaning back?\u2019 I don\u2019t remember looking forward to getting dressed, ever.\u201dUnlimited frees mental space for women to think about more important matters: what to say in that big meeting; how to describe their employment history in a crucial job interview; how to, in the grand scheme of their professional lives, get ahead. \u201cWomen spend more time, more energy, more, just, time being distracted with shopping and thinking about the way they look compared to men,\u201d Ms. Lemkau said. \u201cEven at work, men were basically just deciding what tie to wear, and now, for the most part, they don\u2019t even wear ties. Is this service another way to potentially level the playing field?\u201dBefore joining Unlimited in 2016, Ms. Dwivedi spent untold hours rifling through fast-fashion stores like H&M and Zara, searching for a trendy blazer or statement necklace to liven up her work wardrobe. These days, she typically \u201cshops\u201d on Rent the Runway\u2019s iPhone app, scrolling through silk blouses and floral dresses as if they were Spotify songs, assessing member-submitted photos of the clothes out in the real world.\u201cI\u2019m having drinks with my mentor on Wednesday. I wasn\u2019t sure what to wear to that, so I gave myself a couple of options. If this is as flattering as I think it could be, I\u2019ll probably wear this,\u201d Ms. Dwivedi said, holding up a striped, sleeveless linen shift dress in a clear plastic sheathe. \u201cAnd if not, this maxi\u201d \u2014 a floor length, flowy black dress emblazoned with tropical blossoms.This is the trade-off. While Ms. Dwivedi luxuriates in the designer clothing that does fit \u2014 she received a steady stream of compliments from co-workers on a pink, plaid Trina Turk coat that she wore while pregnant with her first child \u2014 the stuff that does not must be sent back to the warehouse before she can order something new. The process generally takes a day or two.The Rent the Runway app and website regularly prompt users to review what they borrowed, and with a few taps, Ms. Dwivedi could report that the dress was not true to size. Despite the inconvenience of waiting for another shipment, she prefers this process to trying on outfits in a store. \u201cI would rather have the shaming of it all and the judging experience on my own,\u201d she said.\u201cOver 50 percent of our customers provide data back to us after they rent, every single time,\u201d said Jenn Hyman, 38, who is Rent the Runway\u2019s chief executive and co-founder. \u201cWithout an incentive, our customers want to make this service better for other women, and they\u2019re telling us because they want us to fix the problem.\u201d She was standing in the company\u2019s 250,000-square-foot warehouse in Secaucus, N.J. \u2014 a structure it says is the largest dry-cleaning facility in the world. Rent the Runway calls it the Dream Fulfillment Center.It is garment-tracking infrastructure of staggering proportions. Unlike companies that have democratized access to movies (Netflix) or music (Spotify), Rent the Runway peddles in touchable, feel-able, not-streamable material goods \u2014 garments that lose buttons and rip and stain and go through God knows what after they slide onto the bodies of their temporary owners.\u201cThere are three times during the process where we\u2019re doing a quality inspection,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. Next to her, an employee was sniffing the contents of a garment bag, one of hundreds that UPS and FedEx deliver to the warehouse each morning. \u201cCustomers sometimes tell us that there\u2019s an item they didn\u2019t wear, but our smell test is more important,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. \u201cEvery single item goes through a cleaning and sanitation process.\u201dIndustrial washers spun, dryers tumbled and garments on hangers clicked as they made their way through a maze of scaffolding, en route to a machine that would spit them out encased in plastic. \u201cThe system knows that that blouse needs to wait for a pair of jeans to come in,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. \u201cIt won\u2019t send it over to shipping until all of the items in that order have been brought together. That\u2019s something someone\u2019s wearing to an event,\u201d she said, gesturing at an off-the-shoulder gown of salmon-colored chiffon. \u201cVegas!\u201d she trilled, pointing at a white-and-red-sequined bomber jacket.Of Rent the Runway\u2019s 1,200 employees, 770 are in Secaucus. A second such facility is due to open in Dallas next year, to speed up delivery times to users not on the East Coast. An additional 130 people work on the company\u2019s engineering, information technology and analytics teams. They continually tweak algorithms to identify pieces that customers might like and highlight them on the app\u2019s home screen, similar to recommendations offered by Amazon and Netflix.\u201cWe\u2019re collecting hundreds of thousands of data points every week: style, fit of the garment, what occasion you wore that to, what else is going on in your life, who are you?\u201d said Ms. Hyman. \u201cWe\u2019re creating one-to-one style personas for every user we have, which is helping us create an individual home page for you, where we can recommend clothing that you might like. Part of that is not just to recommend the things that you\u2019re already comfortable with, but to help you discover things that you didn\u2019t know you\u2019d love.\u201d Essentially, they\u2019re using data to engineer whimsy \u2014 that feeling of seeing something in a store window and rushing in to plunk down a credit card.Rent the Runway shares its findings with the designers whose clothing it stocks. (The company buys wholesale, like a department store.) \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing amount of data that traditional retailers don\u2019t always share: What other brands is she wearing, how many times do our dresses get dry-cleaned and still come back as new?\u201d said Jan-Hendrik Schlottmann, the C.E.O. of the high-fashion label Derek Lam. \u201cYou learn a lot from that and from reading the comments the clients make online. It\u2019s great market research, frankly.\u201dMr. Schlottmann said he doesn\u2019t worry that rentals will cannibalize sales. \u201cThe Rent the Runway customer is not a customer we\u2019re losing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to spend $1,500 on a dress, because she doesn\u2019t understand the value. We kind of think we\u2019re taking money away from fast fashion by letting her try on and rent clothes. Instead of having her buy Zara\u2019s copy of our dress, I\u2019d rather have her experience our construction, our fabric. Hopefully, she will buy it when she\u2019s ready.\u201dAs a private company, Rent the Runway declined to share its revenue or profit. Ms. Hyman also declined to specify how many Unlimited members there are, but said the subscription business was up 150 percent year over year. In March, an investment of $20 million, in part from the founders of the Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba, reportedly put the company\u2019s valuation at $800 million.Even if Rent the Runway is small compared to established fashion brands, the NPD analyst Marshal Cohen considers the company\u2019s impact significant. \u201cThey are a disrupter. They have really changed the dynamic of what goes on in the marketplace,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not building wardrobes the way we used to, we\u2019re not buying as many shoes, as many bags, we\u2019re wearing a few staple items and mixing and matching them. We\u2019ve gotten so casual in the workplace that we\u2019re basically wearing loungewear.\u201dSeventy-five percent of the clothing that gets shipped out to Unlimited members falls into the broad bucket of business casual. Members have written in asking for more tailored options, and as a result, this fall, the company\u2019s business formal assortment \u2014 suits and pencil skirts by labels including Theory, Tibi and Iro \u2014 will increase 250 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s attire that a conservative lawyer could wear to the office everyday,\u201d Ms. Hyman said.Before joining Unlimited in 2016, Ariel Cohen, a 29-year-old account director for the New York public relations firm Magrino, spent about $500 a month at shops like Club Monaco and Anthropologie. She\u2019s cut that to $100 a month \u2014 and eliminated her monthly dry cleaning bill, also around $100. \u201cI make investments in things now that I consider \u2018forever pieces,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m able to have the more colorful and loud parts of my wardrobe be things that I can wear once or twice, post a pic to Instagram, and move on.\u201d She gestured at her Jason Wu pants: white, wide-legged, emblazoned with big, blue flowers. \u201cLike these, I\u2019d never buy.\u201dFor women entering the job force, Unlimited has been a crucial hack. \u201cTo go from college to my first career, it was really challenging,\u201d said Elisabeth Armstrong, 24, a former television reporter in Tennessee who recently transitioned to a finance job in Colorado. \u201cMy salary was not really conducive to buying a new wardrobe.\u201d\u201cI found myself falling into this pattern of fast fashion, buying a blazer here, a dress there,\u201d before signing up for Unlimited in 2016, Ms. Armstrong said. \u201cIt\u2019s really challenging for us, as women. Men have the standard suit. With the emphasis on your personal brand, your presentation, I think there\u2019s more weight on appearance than there ever has been.\u201d\u201cI had exhausted the options that I own \u2014 my co-workers had seen them all,\u201d said Caroline Peck, a 25-year-old advertising associate in Birmingham, Ala. \u201cRecently, I was in San Antonio for a big client meeting. I rented this beautiful dress, and even my client complimented me. Then I told them about Unlimited.\u201d Ms. Peck ended up buying the dress, a black, full-skirted Erin Fetherston number with a white Peter Pan collar.Sarah Joyce, who works at a major technology company in Los Angeles, joined Unlimited last December, feeling frumpy and uninspired by her wardrobe. Her initial attitude, she said, was: \u201cRad. I\u2019m going to take more risks, I can send it back, I\u2019m going to do the Chlo\u00e9, the Veronica Beard.\u201d\u201cI was like, now I know how female baller executives look hot,\u201d said Ms. Joyce, 40. \u201cYou\u2019re faking it till you make it. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d She got so much praise on a maroon Cinq \u00e0 Sept maxi dress that she ended up buying it for $500. Then it happened again. \u201cI ended up buying everything,\u201d said Ms. Joyce. \u201cI bought a romper, blouses. It was a problem. Ninety percent of the stuff I rented, I never returned. Then it occurred to me this stuff has been worn by other people so many times, that\u2019s probably why it\u2019s cheap.\u201dIn June, wary of devouring Unlimited\u2019s collection of designer purses, Ms. Joyce canceled her membership. She also grew weary of attracting attention at the office. \u201cIt made such a fuss at work,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Oh, is that also Rent the Runway?\u2019 I felt like a walking billboard.\u201dSome women don\u2019t mind this, like Elizabeth Derby, a 29-year-old senior product marketing manager at Artsy, an art start-up. I spoke to her this summer, when she worked at Betterment, a financial services start-up in New York. \u201cThe funny thing is, there are a lot of men that work here, more men than women, and way more guys in the office know that I use Rent the Runway because they\u2019re always commenting on stuff and saying, \u2018I wish they had that for guys,\u2019\u201d Ms. Derby said. At the time, she was part of a Slack channel that Unlimited subscribers at Betterment use to rate outfits and collect garment bags for drop-off at a showroom Rent the Runway keeps on West 15th Street in Manhattan. (Returns taken there get processed faster than those sent to the warehouse.)\u201cThere\u2019s also the sustainability factor,\u201d said her tag-checking co-worker, Danielle Shechtman. \u201cIf you keep buying clothes and not using them, it\u2019s pretty harmful for the environment.\u201dMs. Derby nodded. \u201cEvery year I get rid of four or five garbage bags of clothes. I don\u2019t even know how I accumulate them.\u201dWith unlimited options comes a kind of perverse pressure: There\u2019s no excuse to not look good. I discovered this myself in April, when I signed up for Unlimited. One major upside: Since enlisting, I\u2019ve purchased only one piece of clothing, a dress I initially rented through Unlimited. But on the app, I routinely went down the rabbit hole of comparing one potential rental to another, reading review after review, scrolling through top picks, new arrivals and categories like \u201cDress Spotlight\u201d and \u201cTrending: Statement Tops.\u201d I had to force myself to stop.It happened again in real life in August, when I visited Rent the Runway\u2019s New York showroom, a Willy Wonka-esque emporium for fashion fiends. Intending to be in and out in 20 minutes, I instead stayed for more than an hour.When I got there, a smiling greeter prompted me to sign up for a fitting room on an iPad, so I could spend time browsing and not standing in line. Salespeople \u2014 if they can be called that, since none of the merchandise had price tags \u2014 went out of their way to unload my arms as they filled with hangers.But when I got to where I was staying, I tried the dress on again and started sweating almost immediately. I ended up wearing a cotton dress I\u2019d owned for three years to the meeting. Later, I inelegantly stuffed the Marni into my suitcase and eventually sent it back to the warehouse unworn.Rent the Runway can\u2019t be expected to solve the paralysis of choice or irrationality that plagues some of us; if anything, its future plans will exacerbate those tendencies. Ms. Hyman wants customers to be able to borrow more items, from an ever-expanding library of brands, at any time they choose.\u201cThe vision is that within a few blocks of where all of our subscribers live, all over the country, our members have access to a magical closet that has inventory that\u2019s personalized to them, that they can access 24 hours a day,\u201d said Ms. Hyman. \u201cWe\u2019re building out the technology to make seamless access to that closet as delightful and frictionless as possible.\u201d She added, \u201cRent the Runway closets should feel as organic in your day as going to Starbucks.\u201dThe ephemeral, on-demand closets of Ms. Hyman\u2019s dreams would be something altogether different, and freeing. They would allow us to use our old-fashioned physical closets, and our time and energy, for something else.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Offering Inspiration and Advice, Real Vision Is HGTV for Hedge Fund Hopefuls", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKieran O\u2019Dea rises at 5 a.m. to begin his daily routine, shuffling to his desk to eye his portfolio: a cluster of biotechnology stocks and a bet that Tesla will go bust.His office consists of an unmade bed, two computer screens and a stunning view of Long Island Sound. Mr. O\u2019Dea may be master of his own hedge fund, but he could not be more disconnected from the Wall Street machine. No sell-side research clogs his inbox. He does not own a Bloomberg terminal. And there is no TV tuned to CNBC, the financial news hub ubiquitous on trading floors.\u201cI hardly watch it \u2014 and I don\u2019t have access to any of that other stuff, either,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cI get all my market access from Twitter and Real Vision.\u201dReal Vision offers a way to skip the traditional hedge fund path: slog away at an investment bank or a mutual fund, then settle down in Midtown Manhattan or Greenwich, Conn. For a modest fee, Real Vision will connect investors to a network of elite Wall Street analysts, traders and hedge fund managers, making it easier for novices like Mr. O\u2019Dea to jump the line.Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund executive who also worked at Goldman Sachs and runs an investment strategy service called Global Macro Investor, co-founded Real Vision. Since then, 20,000 people have signed up, paying $180 a year to hear directly from financial insiders.Real Vision also celebrates the hedge fund life \u2014 the outsize trades, houses and swagger \u2014 and tempts aspirants like Mr. O\u2019Dea into thinking that they, too, might join the club.It is a world that Mr. Pal, who earlier in his career pitched ideas to luminaries like Paul Tudor Jones and George Soros, knows well. He said he was motivated to start Real Vision after watching CNBC\u2019s coverage of the financial crisis and thinking there was an opening for deep dives into finance\u2019s most arcane areas.\u201cThe media was too busy treating finance as entertainment and sound bites,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are going to cheerlead while this thing is going up, you have to warn them of the risks. It is a moral obligation.\u201dBut there\u2019s still an element of theater to Real Vision. Recently, Mr. Pal interviewed Michael Novogratz, a billionaire investor specializing in cryptocurrencies, in his office. During the discussion on the ups and downs of Bitcoin, Mr. Novogratz wore pink jeans that matched his sneakers and took a seat in front of an original leather jumpsuit worn by the motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, standing in a glass case under neon lights.Mr. Pal had flown in from his home in the Cayman Islands, and he displayed an untucked shirt, sneakers without socks and a stubble beard. It could well have been a scene from \u201cBillions,\u201d the television show about the machinations and appetites of hedge fund titans.\u201cI used to think that these guys were gods,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cBut if you spend enough time watching them, you can figure out what they are up to.\u201dAnd if his formative experience was being a world-ranked video game player \u2014 in both World of Warcraft and Smite, he said \u2014 not a striving investment banker, so what? Mr. O\u2019Dea watched the best gamers as he honed his craft once before. How hard could it be?\u201cIt has been my total school \u2014 I mean, I had no idea what a bear market or a bull market was when I started,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cIt was like watching people play video games.\u201dCurrently, 9,790 hedge funds are plying their trade, according to HFR, an industry tracker. With so many options, the pressure to perform has never been greater.The last time hedge funds collectively beat the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was 2008. So far this year, Hedge Knight is up 37 percent Mr. O\u2019Dea said, soundly beating the index\u2019s 9 percent increase and thrashing the near-flat return the fund\u2019s peer group has delivered.Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s grandfather Leonard E. Baum was Hedge Knight\u2019s main financial backer until his death. Propped up against Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s window is a faded photograph of Mr. Baum, a mathematician who put in place the trading framework that James H. Simons, the founder of Renaissance Technologies, employed to make his $84 billion Medallion Fund one of the world\u2019s most successful hedge funds. Sitting in a lawn chair, Mr. Baum has his toddler grandson in a tight hug.If his grandfather was Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s main source of capital, Real Vision is his source of inspiration.In the video, Mr. Hart wears his hair slicked back and spins tales of accumulating art, becoming an expert in Brazilian jujitsu and living in the moment \u2014 what he refers to as \u201cchasing flow.\u201d\u201cI wanted to be that guy,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea recalled.He made a pilgrimage to Texas to meet Mr. Hart, and they bonded over biotechnology companies. Mr. O\u2019Dea was curious about the science of disease: His grandfather suffered from cone-rod dystrophy, a condition that erodes vision, and his younger brother Brennan \u2014 the only other employee at Hedge Knight \u2014 is afflicted with over a half-dozen autoimmune illnesses. Brennan O\u2019Dea spends nine months a year in a small cabin in Idaho, studying biology and scanning the market for cutting-edge companies. He has selected all 12 biotech stocks in Hedge Knight\u2019s portfolio.Real Vision has plenty of believers.\u201cI have been a subscriber since they were two months old,\u201d said Chase Taylor, 35, an Air Force officer whose dream is to sell investment research to hedge funds.He has not worked in the industry, nor did he go to business school. \u201cI figured if these guys are doing it, I can too,\u201d he said.When Mr. Pal told subscribers in early 2017 that he was raising $7 million from outside investors, 1,700 offered to invest. He ultimately increased the sum to $10 million, and 50 subscribers became shareholders, although neither Mr. O\u2019Dea nor Mr. Taylor is among them.Take Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s fund: a dozen biotechnology stocks, some with values below $50 million, and a bet that Tesla goes bankrupt. It is a very risky portfolio, especially for a manager with such limited experience.Real Vision is careful to present its strategies as trading ideas \u2014 not recommendations. At the end of each video, an employee warns investors to weigh their risk appetite before jumping in.Ultimately, Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s contention that in finance \u2014 as with video games \u2014 you can ascend to an elite level by scrutinizing what the best players do remains unproven.Which does not mean he won\u2019t give it a shot.\u201cNow, I know what I am doing,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cAnd guess what: I am a 29-year-old hedge fund manager.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In August, its credit rating was cut to one level above junk status. And Ford\u2019s stock price has fallen to its lowest point since 2009, when the United States economy was in a deep recession.\u201cThe foundation of Ford \u2014 the trucks \u2014 is still healthy, but there are concerns about whether Ford has prepared for tomorrow and the future,\u201d said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of the auto information providers Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. \u201cFord hasn\u2019t been effective enough in convincing investors that they are.\u201dIn the latest move to cut costs, Ford is reorganizing its worldwide salaried work force of 70,000 with the goal of having a leaner staff by the second quarter of 2019. The move, outlined to employees on Thursday, is likely to eliminate several thousand jobs, said Karen Hampton, a company spokeswoman.\u201cWe believe there will be reductions as part of it, but we don\u2019t have specific targets,\u201d Ms. Hampton said. She said the reorganization was meant to speed decision-making and cut the time it takes to develop new vehicles, two points that Mr. Hackett has emphasized.The effort was first reported by The Detroit Free Press.Part of the frustration among those sizing up the company stems from Mr. Hackett\u2019s slow rollout of a recovery plan. Since taking the helm in May 2017, Mr. Hackett has outlined broad cost-reduction goals, but has stopped short of explaining how they will be achieved. Ford once planned a daylong meeting with Wall Street analysts on Sept. 25, but canceled it in July, saying it needed more time.Elements of the plan are emerging bit by bit. Beyond the reduction in the salaried work force, another initiative involves partnerships.Ford is in talks with Volkswagen about a broad alliance that could help turn around its ailing operations in Europe and South America. It is also discussing ways to expand cooperation with Mahindra, the Indian automaker. India is another market where Ford is struggling.Mr. Ford, a great-grandson of the company\u2019s founder, Henry Ford, acknowledged the discussions at the Rouge complex, now the site of a plant that produces the F-150 pickup.\u201cWe don\u2019t ever rely on a partner to fix things for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to get our own house in order first. Partnerships can help with capital intensity and things like that.\u201dAnalysts said a partnership with Volkswagen could help both companies. Ford makes money on delivery vans and other small trucks, an area where Volkswagen struggles. The cooperation could involve helping Volkswagen produce small pickups like the Ford Ranger and sharing the cost of developing electric vehicles and other technologies to meet more stringent emissions regulations in Europe.\u201cVolkswagen is definitely intriguing,\u201d said Brian Johnson of Barclays Capital. \u201cYou can definitely see the business logic behind it.\u201dA century ago, Ford revolutionized auto manufacturing when it opened the Rouge complex. A marvel in its time, it produced cars and all their parts, including glass, tires and engines. It generated its own electricity, had a hospital and police station and employed as many as 100,000 workers. This vertical integration helped Ford lower costs enough to produce cars that ordinary people could afford.The urgency was highlighted last week when Mr. Hackett said on Bloomberg television that the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on imported aluminum and steel would raise Ford\u2019s costs by $1 billion. The company said the costs would be incurred in 2018 and 2019.The tariffs could erode the profit margins of the F-150, which has aluminum body panels. But Mr. Ford said the automaker had taken the tariffs into account and did not need to modify its turnaround plan.\u201cWe just want to work with the administration on trade issues, tariff issues, and they\u2019ve been quite good about it,\u201d he said. But Ford \u201cruns a lot better when we have certainty and we don\u2019t have big gyrations,\u201d he added. \u201cOur business is at its best when we have certainty with tax regimes, trade regimes.\u201dAnother trade move by the administration was welcomed by Ford \u2014 the agreement that keeps Canada in a three-nation trade zone in North America. Ford makes trucks and sport utility vehicles in Ontario.Just two years ago, Ford seemed like the healthiest of the three Detroit automakers. But while it makes a solid profit on trucks and S.U.V.s like the Explorer, recent earnings reports have shown it losing money on its cars. At the same time, profit has plunged in Europe and Asia, efforts to turn around its South American business have shown little progress, and returns in North America, by far Ford\u2019s largest region, have slumped.\u201cThe problem is they didn\u2019t update and redesign their products enough,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader. \u201cIt comes back to being slow on product decisions and product development.\u201dBut his reluctance to spell out the elements of his restructuring plan has rankled analysts who follow the company and try to predict how much money it will make.Mr. Hackett was hailed for his previous tenure as chief executive \u2014 at the office-furniture company Steelcase \u2014 but he is facing a tougher challenge in running Ford, a much larger company with 200,000 employees and dozens of plants around the world.\u201cWe\u2019d like him to be crisper in going from high-level statements into the actionable plans they are going to carry out,\u201d Mr. Johnson of Barclays Capital said.The tension was evident in a July conference call when Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley expressed frustration at the lack of detail on what the $11 billion in charges will cover. He asked Mr. Hackett if he would still be around when it came time to assess the results.\u201cI think there should be zero question about that,\u201d Mr. Hackett replied.In the meantime, plenty of questions remain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Charged Ahead in the Third Quarter", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy barreled ahead in the third quarter as consumers stepped up and spent more, keeping it on track for the best annual performance since 2005.The government said on Friday that the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent between July and September after the 4.2 percent pace in the previous quarter. But there were signs that the growth could cool in the coming months.Businesses remain hesitant to increase spending, despite the large corporate tax cut enacted late last year. Some of the gains were also one-offs that could fade quickly, like the restocking of shelves at stores and warehouses, which contributed more than half of the overall growth.If there is a slowdown in the economy, it could further unsettle the markets, which have slumped in recent weeks. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 1.7 percent on Friday and is down nearly 9 percent for the month.\u201cClearly a strong headline, but the details are a little less robust,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, who leads United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Still, with 10 days to go before the midterm election, the headline number will be a valuable talking point for Republicans on the campaign trail. The second and third quarters represented the strongest back-to-back growth since 2014, and Republican leaders were quick to claim credit.\u201cAmericans have more opportunity and more money in their pockets today than they did two years ago, and that\u2019s in large part due to the reforms we\u2019ve pushed forward,\u201d said Representative Erik Paulsen, a Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee and is in a tight race for re-election, according to recent polls.Tax cuts for individuals and the budget deal early this year, which raised federal spending, helped elevate growth in the third quarter. Consumer spending increased 4 percent, and federal outlays rose 3.3 percent.\u201cThere will come a day of reckoning for the economy after the money from the tax cuts is all gone,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, \u201cbut for today Washington really has something to crow about.\u201dThe effect of the corporate tax cut was less evident. Businesses did not ramp up investment in equipment and factories \u2014 the kinds of things executives do when they anticipate the good times to continue.\u201cYou really lean back in your chair and wonder whether this enormous tax cut that was given to corporations only lasted three months,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank. \u201cThe economics textbook would say that if you give a tax cut that lasts several years, you should see the effects for several years.\u201dLooking ahead, Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said that he was not expecting a big rebound in business spending and that \u201cif you\u2019re banking on strong G.D.P. growth, you need business investment.\u201dAnother wild card is the effect from one of President Trump\u2019s signature economic moves: increasing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports. The president has also raised tariffs on imports from around the world, including on steel, aluminum and solar panels. So far, there is little evidence that those trade policies have hurt growth much.A surge in soybean purchases by buyers seeking to act before retaliatory Chinese tariffs kicked in helped lift gross domestic product in the second quarter. But that uptick reversed itself in the third quarter.\u201cOne interpretation of the data is that the trade war is not having the intended effect of boosting exports and lowering imports,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cAnother interpretation is that the trade war can\u2019t do much about that. If the consumer spends more, you will have more imports.\u201dTrip Tollison, chief executive of the Savannah Economic Development Authority in Georgia, said that shipping volume at the Port of Savannah was up 12 percent from a year ago and that there were almost no vacancies in the industrial real estate market. Warehouses and logistics companies have been among the most active businesses in the area.\u201cWe\u2019re in a great spot, no complaints for sure,\u201d Mr. Tollison said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very strong economy right now.\u201dThe latest data could increase the likelihood that policymakers at the Federal Reserve will continue to gradually raise interest rates, in order to prevent the economy from overheating and to head off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise rates one more time this year, in December, and several times in 2019.Officials at the Fed, who do not report to the president, consider themselves above politics. Mr. Trump\u2019s attack is highly unusual.The steady increase in borrowing costs is already being felt in the housing market. Residential investment slid 4 percent in the third quarter, and has fallen in five of the last six quarters.Rising interest rates also put downward pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has been climbing, which makes riskier stocks less appealing to investors than safer bonds.\u201cWe can only think investors are already looking ahead to economic conditions next year when the fiscal stimulus boost starts to fade,\u201d Mr. Rupkey of MUFG Union Bank said. \u201cFor the stock market, the economy\u2019s as good as it gets, and after buying the rumors, they are selling the fact.\u201dWall Street\u2019s recent decline, which began in early October, came too late to affect sentiment or spending in the third quarter. But on Main Street, consumers do have plenty to cheer. Unemployment in September stood at 3.7 percent, the lowest in nearly half a century, and wages are finally rising.In Chicago, Avant, an online consumer lender with 600 employees, is planning to hire 400 more people by the end of 2019. The company specializes in lending to families earning between $40,000 and $100,000 for things like debt consolidation, auto repairs and medical bills. It also sells online lending technology to banks.\u201cConsumers today are in great shape,\u201d said Al Goldstein, Avant\u2019s chief executive. Injecting a note of caution, he added that \u201cif interest rates continue to rise, that may change.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Strong earnings from companies like Twitter and Microsoft seemed to ease some worries of investors, who have been focused on issues like the trade war with China, rising interest rates and the midterms.The stock market tumble of the last few weeks is not a mystery to be solved, nor a warning of horrible things to come, so much as an inevitable result of the economic expansion reaching a more mature stage. The stock market looks forward, not back \u2014 share prices are determined by what investors think the future looks like. And the economic future is starting to look quite different from the past.Some key points from the WSJ\u2019s Shalini Ramachandran and Joe Flint:\u2022 \u201cEmployees are encouraged to give one another blunt feedback. Managers are all told to apply a \u2018keeper test\u2019 to their staff \u2014 asking themselves whether they would fight to keep a given employee \u2014 a mantra for firing people who don\u2019t fit the culture and ensuring only the strongest survive.\u201d\u2022 \u201cThe firings can be insensitive, several former employees said. Ernie Tam, who had worked as a Netflix engineer for six years, was called into his manager\u2019s office on a Monday morning in 2015. \u2018You\u2019re no longer a star performer,\u2019 the manager said.

The emails about firings can reach hundreds of employees across multiple divisions and can be painfully specific, calling out an employee\u2019s flaws, while inviting more questions and gossip, many employees say.\u201dProminent Western business executives like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Larry Fink of BlackRock abandoned this week\u2019s big Saudi investment conference, and the crowd was mostly made up of lower-profile Russian, Asian and Arab attendees. And the scandal may reduce Prince Mohammed\u2019s ability to work with international investors while finding new places to invest his country\u2019s wealth abroad.As Denis Florin of the consultancy Lavoisier Conseil told the NYT, \u201cPractically, is this going to delay M.B.S.\u2019s ambitions? Yes. Is it going to wreck them? No.\u201dTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will be watching closely. He has commented on the falling value of the renminbi and warned China not to adjust the currency improperly.

{"Headline": "The Joy of Cooking for One", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCooking for yourself can be even better \u2014\u00a0more delicious, practical and creative \u2014 than cooking for a crowd.A touch of any of these ingredients can change the direction of a dish. Take Ms. Lo\u2019s recipe for pan-roasted cauliflower, which relies on a store-bought spice mix \u2014 tangy with dried mango and black salt \u2014 to effortlessly turn the vegetable into a quick, South Asian-style chaat.The cauliflower is broken into florets and browned in a saucepan (an impossible task when cooking a large amount), then seasoned with a sauce of cilantro, yogurt and green chiles. To make the garnish, Ms. Lo warms chopped almonds in the toaster oven, which she considers a valuable and versatile tool in any small, efficient kitchen.In her book, Ms. Jones wrote that \u201cthe secret of making cooking for one fun and creative is not to think of a meal as self-contained, but to understand that home cooking is an ongoing process, one dish leading to another.\u201d This is distinct from leftovers, warmed up as they are.To preserve vegetables when cooking in small amounts, Ms. Lo cuts them with care. \u201cIf you\u2019re cutting an onion, you cut it from the growth side, not the root side,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you leave the brown paper skin on so it holds the moisture. Then you cut off what you\u2019re going to use and only peel and chop that part.\u201dFrom shopping to prepping to eating, cooking for one requires more efficiency to avoid waste or a mountain of leftovers.\u201cI think a lot of learning to cook for yourself is about portions, and just making sure you\u2019re cooking the amount you\u2019re going to eat,\u201d Ms. Lo added.\u201cPeople want more recipes for one,\u201d said Mr. Kim, who usually pours himself a glass of wine and plays an episode of the Netflix show \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d on his laptop while he cooks. \u201cCooking for myself is part of my ritual,\u201d he said. \u201cIt keeps me sane.\u201dMr. Kim also believes that cooking on a smaller scale happens to yield more delicious food. \u201cI think it\u2019s a volume situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a huge batch, it\u2019s hard to make it taste the way you want.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a way to nurture yourself and nourish yourself,\u201d Ms. Miller said.Ms. Miller\u2019s approach is exact. \u201cOne thing I believe strongly in is buying small quantities of food so you don\u2019t end up wasting ingredients,\u201d she said.When she buys something big, like a whole chicken, Ms. Miller might roast it and use the meat for four consecutive recipes, cooking each one differently but still using up every part of the bird.Otherwise, she\u2019ll portion meat or fish individually and pack them in the freezer. \u201cGetting good at using your freezer is key,\u201d Ms. Miller said. (Likewise, Ms. Lo vacuum-seals bacon in packages of two slices so she can grab a single portion from the freezer.) Ms. Miller also uses ice cube trays to freeze sauces, such as chimichurri, and to store any excess herbs in olive oil before they have the chance to spoil in the fridge. Later she\u2019ll pop out the herb cubes one at a time to finish a soup or stew.She first began cooking for herself when she lived in Paris while attending culinary school. She started small, with rice and saut\u00e9ed vegetables from the market, but later, at a restaurant called Mama Shelter, she tasted a shepherd\u2019s pie made with duck and decided to recreate it at home, just for herself, using mashed potatoes and a piece of store-bought, fat-encased duck confit.\u201cMost people are taught from a young age to be kind and generous to other people,\u201d said Ms. Miller. \u201cWhy not turn some of that kindness and generosity toward yourself?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Resume Slide, Pulling S.&P. 500 Briefly Into a Correction ", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe benchmark index fell to 10 percent off its most recent peak in early trading on Friday but recovered some of those losses. It is down more than 9 percent from its high in September.Disappointing earnings reports from the tech giants Amazon and Alphabet set off another turbulent day on Wall Street on Friday, and the benchmark stock-market index briefly dipped into a correction. Amazon ended down nearly 8 percent and Alphabet, the parent company of the search giant Google, fell 1.8 percent after they reported quarterly results on Thursday evening. Their reports did little to calm jittery investors who have focused on quarterly corporate updates in search of clues to the economic outlook for 2019. Amazon\u2019s sales forecast for the coming holiday season fell short of investor hopes. And Alphabet\u2019s revenue fell short of analyst expectations. \u201cThe poor earnings are reflecting a slowdown in growth, not a disastrous slowdown, but enough to take stocks down,\u201d said Ilya Feygin, managing director at the institutional brokerage firm WallachBeth. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the broad measure of the United States stock market, tumbled throughout the morning, falling as much as 2.8 percent before clawing back some losses to finish down 1.7 percent. At one point, the early-day losses had the index down more than 10 percent below its recent peak on Sept. 20. By the close of trading Friday, the S.&.P. was down more 9 percent from that late-September high, and is now in negative territory for the year.In financial markets, a drop of 10 percent or more is typically referred to as a correction \u2014 a term that describes a market sell-off that is more serious than a garden-variety slump. Such stumbles are not uncommon: Earlier this year markets fell more than 10 percent in a violent sell-off that ended in early February. There was some indication on Friday that the sharp downturn in stocks had some investors reconsidering whether the Federal Reserve will go through with an interest rate hike at its next meeting in December. Analysis of interest rate futures suggested that there was less certainty about that rate hike than there had been even a few days ago, according to Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets.Some pockets of the market sensitive to interest rates actually rallied, helping to cut losses. Shares of homebuilders, which have been hit hard this year rose more than 2 percent.Including this recent slide, six sell-offs have earned the correction designation since the current bull market for stocks began in March 2009. The nearly decade-long rise in stocks is one of the longest such runs on record. But given the length of the current bull market \u2014 in which stocks have risen nearly 300 percent \u2014 investors have been uneasy. \u201cThe question is: Is this the top of a bull market? And is the recession going to start?\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity strategist at institutional brokerage BTIG. But those worries are not necessarily justified, Mr. Emanuel said.\u201cFrom our point of view, everything that we see tells us that a recession is not imminent,\u201d he said.Fresh economic data supports that view. Government numbers released on Friday showed that gross domestic product rose at a robust 3.5 percent annual pace during the third quarter. Third-quarter corporate profits \u2014 which public companies are currently releasing \u2014 are on pace to be up more than 20 percent. Even so, there are factors that have dampened investor enthusiasm, including rising interest rates, slowing growth in China \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest economy \u2014 and cost increases tied to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.On Friday, the waves of selling, and the odd bit of buying, churned through the markets in a volatile session. Alphabet\u2019s share price was down as much as 5.5 percent and up as much as 1 percent before settling lower by 1.8 percent. Investors continued to pound the share prices of companies that offered less optimistic outlooks for the coming year. Mohawk Industries, which makes carpet, hardwood flooring and vinyl tiling, plunged 23.9 percent after its earnings report on Friday fell short of expectations. The computer-drive maker Western Digital, which delivered disappointing results in its report after the market closed on Thursday, dove by 18 percent. Not all corporate results have depressed the market. The information technology services firm Roper Technologies rose 7.6 percent on a solid earnings report on Friday, making it the best performing stock in the S.&P. 500. But on the whole, the technology sector continued its recent slump, as large and small companies alike continued to slide. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.1 percent, pulled lower by Facebook, which fell 3.7 percent, and Apple, which declined 1.6 percent. Both companies are scheduled to report earnings next week. The Nasdaq is down nearly 11 percent this month, in a brutal reversal for the tech and software shares that had been a favorite for mutual funds, hedge funds and other institutional investors this year.\u201cWe think that institutional money kind of got crowded into those kinds of names,\u201d said Kevin Dennean, Americas I.T. sector strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cFor whatever reason, you\u2019re seeing money come out of those high-growth software names.\u201dAdvertisement"}

A strong market going into the election doesn\u2019t necessarily help the incumbent\u2019s party.\u201d Nor does a bad stock market seem to hurt it.The same was true for the health of the economy: It had no discernible impact on the political outcome.Consider 2006, the middle of President George W. Bush\u2019s second term. Heading into the congressional elections that year, the stock market was up 11 percent. The economy grew that year at a 2.7 percent clip.Yet Democrats achieved a sweeping victory, gaining a majority in the House (which made Nancy Pelosi the first female speaker) and control of the Senate (where Bernie Sanders and Joe Lieberman joined 49 Democratic senators for an effective Democratic majority).Polls that year suggested that voter frustration over the Iraq war, Mr. Bush\u2019s proposal to privatize Social Security and the Republican-controlled Congress\u2019s scant achievements outweighed the positive economic backdrop.Many investors feared that the loss of Republican majorities would hurt financial markets. But the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended 2006 with an impressive gain of nearly 16 percent.In 2010, during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, the economy was growing at a respectable 2.5 percent rate, and the stock market was up nearly 7 percent.Yet Democrats suffered widespread midterm losses. Republicans captured 63 seats in the House, regaining the majority, and gained six seats in the Senate. With the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party whipping up resentment about Wall Street bailouts and high unemployment, Democrats weren\u2019t able to capitalize on either rising stock prices or the economy\u2019s return to growth.Neither do plunging stock prices seem to have much impact on the electorate. In 2002, when the bursting technology bubble caused the S. & P. 500 to drop 22 percent, the president\u2019s party \u2014 in this case the Republicans during Mr. Bush\u2019s first term \u2014 gained seats in the House and Senate.Heading into the 1966 midterms, with Lyndon B. Johnson in the White House, stocks were in a bear market, having fallen 22 percent that year from peak to trough.Yet, the incumbent Democrats fared relatively well, losing only three seats in the Senate and 46 seats in the House and maintaining control of both chambers.The good news for investors is that just as stock prices and the economy appear to have little impact on midterm results, the converse is also true: The outcome of congressional elections has little or no impact on stock prices and the economy. \u201cWhatever the momentum there is going into the elections tends to continue,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cPolitics don\u2019t seem to have much impact.\u201dHe found that, on average, stocks gained 14.5 percent from the end of August to the end of March in the year after midterm elections. That compares with average gains of 6.1 percent over the same period in non-midterm years.Of the 17 midterm election periods Mr. Parker analyzed, only two \u2014 1978 and 2002 \u2014 were followed by market drops.There have been six midterms where one or both houses of Congress experienced a change in control. That had no impact on stocks: The average gains in those years were the same as in years when there was no change in control.The reason stocks do so well around midterm elections, Mr. Parker theorized, is that valuations before the elections tend to be lower than fair value, perhaps because investors are overly concerned about the risk of political change. (That doesn\u2019t appear to have been much of a factor in this week\u2019s drop, which was fueled in large part by concerns about rising interest rates and a trade war with China.)Mr. Parker\u2019s reasoning suggests that any pre-election weakness is a buying opportunity.Mr. Parker cautioned that the period he studied provides too few midterm elections, and thus too little data, to draw any firm conclusions. Still, the market\u2019s outsize gains around midterms are \u201ca significant statistical anomaly,\u201d he said.This year, the S. & P. 500 is down more than 5 percent since the end of August. That means there will have to be a big rally by next spring if Mr. Parker\u2019s pattern is to continue.An earlier version of this column misstated the period of time the chief equity strategist at UBS studied in a review of American midterm elections. The strategist looked at all midterms from 1950 to 2014, not since 1938.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Is Howard Schultz an Asset or a Liability for Starbucks?", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsA presidential run by Howard Schultz may be a double-edged sword for Starbucks investors.The retired founder of the $78 billion coffee chain is widely expected to challenge Donald Trump for the presidency in 2020. Die-hard Starbucks customers might like to see the man who is responsible for their morning caffeine enter the political fray. But the company\u2019s domestic growth will come from Republican states. In the end, Mr. Schultz for president may just be a flat zero for the stock.Credit Bill Ackman for putting the issue front and center for investors. The founder of the Pershing Square hedge fund revealed on Tuesday that his firm has bought 15 million shares, worth some $870 million at current prices, with a view to a \u201cdoppio\u201d \u2014 or double, in Italian. The stock has been unloved by the market, Mr. Ackman said, because Wall Street is overly obsessed with same-store sales. As a result, the shares fetch around $58 a piece today, about the same as three years ago.Mr. Ackman\u2019s bullish presentation at a conference held by the financial markets publication Grant\u2019s Interest Rate Observer was underpinned by a conviction that Kevin Johnson, the chief executive of Starbucks, has taken the right steps to increase sales at existing United States outlets, including combating a slump in sales of its famous Frappuccino drinks. At the same time, Mr. Ackman showed a map of the United States where, despite having 14,000 outlets, the company has little penetration in the Midwest and South. Most of those areas are Republican.The risk is that by taking on Mr. Trump and the G.O.P. in states where Starbucks has little business, Mr. Schultz might become a liability to the company\u2019s expansion plans. America is already deeply divided over far lesser things than the taste \u2014 and provider \u2014 of their coffee. A liberal campaign by Mr. Schultz may be just what rival Dunkin\u2019 needs to take its brand beyond New England.But there\u2019s a benefit, too, in Mr. Schultz entering politics. As Mr. Ackman pointed out, the idea that the Starbucks founder might occupy the Oval Office could offer the company protection from retaliation by Chinese authorities: \u201cThe last thing the Chinese would do is go after the next American president\u2019s company.\u201dBlending those two effects suggests that, for Mr. Ackman and other investors, Mr. Schultz\u2019s effect on the stock may be a wash.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Legalizing Recreational Marijuana, Canada Begins a National Experiment", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAcross the country, as government pot retailers opened from Newfoundland to British Columbia, jubilant Canadians waited for hours in line to buy the first state-approved joints. For many, it was a seminal moment, akin to the ending of Prohibition in the United States in the 1930s.\u201cI have never felt so proud to be Canadian,\u201d said Marco Beaulieu, 29, a janitor, as he waited with friends outside a government cannabis retailer in the east end of Montreal. \u201cCanada is once again a progressive global leader. We have gay rights, feminism, abortion rights, and now we can smoke pot without worrying police are going to arrest us.\u201dIt called on the government to promise to change the law if it leads to increased marijuana use.Marijuana for medical purposes has been legal in Canada since 2001, and about 330,000 Canadians, including cancer patients, are registered to receive it from licensed producers.Pre-rolled joints, fresh or dried marijuana flowers, and cannabis oil are all permitted under the law. Cannabis edibles \u2014 like pot-infused jelly beans, peanut butter and coffee \u2014 won\u2019t be legal for another year.According to Canada\u2019s national statistics office, 4.9 million Canadians used cannabis last year and consumed more than 20 grams of marijuana per person.On Wednesday morning, the government announced that it would introduce legislation to make it easier for Canadians who had been convicted of possessing small amounts of marijuana to obtain a pardon.While the government is not offering a blanket amnesty, Ralph Goodale, the public safety minister, said at a news conference in Ottawa that as \u201ca matter of basic fairness,\u201d the government would seek to end the minimum waiting period of five years to apply for a pardon as well as waiving the fee of 631 Canadian dollars.The federal government has left the country\u2019s 13 provinces and territories to carry out the new legislation and set their own rules, creating a patchwork of regulations. Among many open questions are how the police will test drivers who may be high and how employers deal with employees who smoke before coming to work.\u201cCannabis is not a benign substance,\u201d Dr. Le Foll said. \u201cThere is a clear risk of addiction, and it can produce significant mental health issues if used by the wrong kind of people.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt took decades for the public to understand the risks of cigarettes, and the legalization of cannabis has taken place only over a few years.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t want young people to feel stigmatized, for example, if they don\u2019t use cannabis,\u201d Professor Fallu said.After months of soaring share prices, though, the first day of legal marijuana sales initially saw steep drops in the value of marijuana stocks. That reversed somewhat in the afternoon, leaving the largest companies\u2019 shares down just slightly by the end of trading. Many analysts say the value of legalization was long ago priced to the shares\u2019 value.At the government cannabis store in Montreal \u2014 one of 12 in Quebec \u2014 a line stretched across a long city block on Wednesday morning. Some of the hundreds of people had waited since 3:30 a.m., anticipating the store\u2019s 10 a.m. opening.Kate Guihan, 29, a beautician, said she planned to celebrate the \u201chistoric moment\u201d on Wednesday night with several puffs on a joint. The low cost of government pot, she added, was a big draw for her, along with the fact that legal marijuana was screened and devoid of contaminants.In Halifax, the mood was similarly buoyant.\u201cWe are witnessing history,\u201d said Shawn King, the host of a countdown to legalization on a local radio station. \u201cMarijuana prohibition is ending after 96 years. There\u2019s going to be a generation of people that never knew it was ever banned.\u201dInside a government retailer in Halifax that looked like an Apple store, shoppers browsed for products including \u201cGhost Train\u201d and \u201cLemon Skunk.\u201d Bongs were on display. Some shoppers bought weed, and others accessorized.Others across Canada were ordering pot online from government stores.As online demand soared, stocks quickly ran out, creating fears of marijuana shortages.In New Brunswick, the government cannabis agency provided a step-by-step guide on its website on how to roll a joint.The stated rationale for legalizing cannabis was to tame an illegal multibillion-dollar trade. But from Toronto to Winnipeg to Vancouver, hundreds of illegal shops have indicated that they have no intention of shutting down, and the black market supply chain remains deeply entrenched.In Toronto on Wednesday, revelers \u2014 some wearing T-shirts that said \u201cWeed Won\u201d \u2014 packed a cannabis lounge in the city\u2019s bohemian Kensington Market, where some were smoking black market pot to the sound of reggae music.Toronto had 92 illegal dispensaries the day before legalization, though 56 were shut down Wednesday afternoon. One had a \u201cFor Rent\u201d sign inside its window. Others were shuttered.In Vancouver, dozens of illegal marijuana dispensaries defied the new law by selling, among other things, outlawed edible cannabis and marijuana-infused face creams.Some illegal shops in both cities are hoping to get licensed.\u201cFentanyl kills 11 Canadians a day,\u201d he said, referring to the powerful synthetic opioid that is a public health scourge in some cities like Vancouver. \u201cMarijuana does not.\u201dHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t expect a big crackdown on day one.\u201dIan Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa, Meagan Campbell from Halifax, and Catherine Porter from Toronto.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slumping Stock Market Enters Negative Territory for the Year ", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother wave of selling hit the nearly decade-long bull market as investors worried that the ideal climate they have long enjoyed \u2014 a surging economy, low interest rates and fast-growing corporate profits \u2014 would soon be behind them. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index shed 3 percent on Wednesday, wiping out its gains for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 4.4 percent, and has fallen more than 12 percent since early September.Just over a month ago, the S.&P. 500 was up nearly 10 percent for 2018, with expectations that coming quarterly corporate earnings reports \u2014 juiced by a generous tax cut and strong economic growth \u2014 would keep sending stock prices upward. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.\u201cIt was kind of a market that was looking for a reason to have some money come out of it,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. \u201cAnd it found it.\u201dThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 608 points, or 2.4 percent, on Wednesday. And the Nasdaq has now fallen into correction territory \u2014 a decline of more than 10 percent from an earlier peak, which indicates a drop that\u2019s more serious than a garden-variety slump. The S.&P. 500 is down to 2,656.10, more than 9 percent off its recent peak on Sept. 20, meaning it, too, is nearing a correction. Some market observers think that investors may be moving to the sidelines before what could be a very close and bitter election. \u201cI think people just want to clear the decks and get the heck out before the midterm elections, frankly,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. President Trump has repeatedly cited the strong performance of the stock market as evidence of the success of his administration\u2019s business-friendly approach. And as the market has slid lately, he has ratcheted up his criticism of the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to raise interest rates as economic growth remains strong. Low interest rates have helped support economic growth and the stock market since the financial crisis 10 years ago. But with unemployment at a 49-year low, the Fed is now raising interest rates, saying it wants to keep the economy from overheating, which could set off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again at its next meeting in December.The rise in interest rates has been particularly painful for some pockets of the markets. Shares of homebuilders are down more than 16 percent this month, as rising mortgage rates have made houses less affordable. Smaller companies \u2014 which are heavily exposed to floating-rate debt \u2014 have also been hurt by rising rates, which increases the cost of their debt payments. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks has fallen more than 13 percent in October. And the president\u2019s trade war with China has increasingly preoccupied the markets, analysts said. Official numbers released by Beijing last week showed China\u2019s economic growth has slowed to 6.5 percent, its lowest level since 2009. The slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, could mean falling sales for American companies that export to that market. As large consumers of metal who have invested heavily to gain access to the Chinese auto market \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 carmakers are particularly vulnerable to such risks. On Wednesday, Ford cited weak sales in China for falling profits. Company officials said issues surrounding trade disputes \u2014 including tariffs on imported steel and aluminum \u2014 could cost Ford $1 billion this year. \u201cWhat is really happening here is that people are saying, \u2018We just don\u2019t know about trade. We don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to hit the margins or the earnings streams next year,\u2019\u201d said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm Weeden & Company. Mr. Purves said investors were eager for a resolution to the trade dispute and nervous that it could escalate further.\u201cI think there is a game of chicken going on between Trump and the markets right now,\u201d he added. On Wednesday, the market tumble snowballed over the course of the day. Technology companies that have driven big market gains were badly battered. Shares in the tech heavyweights Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all fell more than 5 percent. Netflix fell more than 9 percent after a media report that Apple planned to announce a subscription television service that would go head-to-head with its streaming service. The news wasn\u2019t all bad for tech. Later Wednesday, Microsoft reported results that exceeded analyst expectations, sending its shares higher in after-hours trading. And Tesla shares also rose in after-hours trading after the electric-car maker reported its first profit in two years. Advertisement"}

So any sign that that inflection point is here is going to be viewed negatively by the market.\u201dThe drop in oil prices rippled through stock markets, sending American energy stocks down more than 2.5 percent.But falling energy prices also seemed to lift shares of companies that rely on consumer spending and could benefit as consumers spend less on gasoline. Companies selling consumer staples, such as groceries, rose slightly Tuesday. Even beyond staples, the picture wasn\u2019t all bad in the United States. Shares of the Pulte Group, a homebuilder, rose 7.3 percent after it reported stronger earnings on higher home prices, helping to pull its fellow homebuilder Lennar higher. That\u2019s a welcome sign for the industry, which has been hammered this year as rising mortgage rates have hurt affordability. McDonald\u2019s reported better-than-expected third-quarter profits and revenue, and its shares jumped 6.3 percent. And shares of Verizon rose more than 4 percent after its results exceed expectations. The electric-car maker Tesla surged more than 12.5 percent after the company announced late Monday that it would move up its third-quarter earnings announcement to Wednesday. Some analysts interpreted the move as an indication that good results were on the way. Tesla shares were also helped when a high-profile Tesla critic and short-seller, Andrew Left of Citron Research, made an about face and announced that he was now betting on a rise in the price. Such isolated bright spots have been swamped out by the overall gloom in the stock markets this earnings season as investors scour results for indications that earnings growth will slow. The S.&P. 500 is down more than 6 percent since peaking on Sept. 20. Back then, the benchmark stock market index was up nearly 10 percent for the year. The tumble in stocks has cut that gain to less than 3 percent. \u201cPeople have been assuming that both fourth-quarter and, more importantly, 2019 growth, in terms of G.D.P. growth and earnings, will continue along the path that it was on this year,\u201d said Matt Maley, an equity strategist at the brokerage firm Miller Tabak. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re hearing otherwise.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Advice on Dealing With the Market, if You Are Already a Pro", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOff the ShelfThe most intriguing part of Howard Marks\u2019s new book about market cycles has nothing to do with the cycles themselves.That\u2019s not a criticism. Mr. Marks does cover his stated subject thoroughly, including the economic cycle (also known as the business cycle), the credit cycle, the real estate cycle and more. And he has filled \u201cMastering the Market Cycle\u201d (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, $30) with graphs mapping out the patterns that occur at various phases during all those cycles.But what is surprising about this detailed and serious work is that he doesn\u2019t think that investors need to pay extremely close attention to these cycles in themselves. What\u2019s truly important, he says, is how other investors are reacting to them.\u201cIn business, financial, and market cycles, most excesses on the upside \u2014 and the inevitable reactions to the downside, which also tend to overshoot \u2014 are the result of exaggerated swings of the pendulum of psychology,\u201d he writes. \u201cThus understanding and being alert to excessive swings is an entry-level requirement for avoiding harm from cyclical extremes and hopefully for profiting from them.\u201dThe reason for the emphasis on investor psychology seems twofold. For one thing, various data about any given cycle are readily available. For example, just about every investor knows we are in the middle of a long bull market. When everyone has the same information, it is difficult to gain an advantage from the data alone.Second, investors\u2019 reactions to the data are not always rational. To oversimplify \u2014 something that Mr. Marks is never guilty of in this 323-page book \u2014 during rising stock markets, investors may overlook any potential warning signs because they are so intoxicated with their current good fortune. As he puts it, in the last stage of a bull market, \u201ceveryone concludes things will get better forever.\u201dSo what is a rational investor to do?Two things, according to Mr. Marks, who is co-founder and co-chairman of Oaktree Capital, a global investment firm with more than $100 billion under management. First, determine the intrinsic value of the investment you are interested in. Intrinsic value is what the investment is actually worth.One way to calculate it is: Total assets minus liabilities and intangible assets such as patents and good will. Don\u2019t worry. You usually don\u2019t have to do the math. The number is labeled \u201cbook value\u201d on a company\u2019s balance sheet.Then, watch the spread between the intrinsic value and market value, the price someone is willing to pay for the investment. For example, in bear markets, a stock with an intrinsic value of $25 a share could be selling at less than half that, a potential buying opportunity.\u201cThere is only one form of intelligent investing, and that is figuring out what something is worth and buying it for that price or less,\u201d Mr. Marks writes. \u201cYou can\u2019t have intelligent investing in the absence of quantification of value and insistence on an attractive purchase price.\u201dStudying the spread can also keep you from paying too much.\u201cWhat\u2019s the greatest source of investment risk? Does it come from negative economic developments? Corporate events that fall short of forecasts? Earning declines? Low creditworthiness? No,\u201d says Mr. Marks, \u201cit comes when asset prices attain excessively high levels as a result of some new intoxicating investment rationale that can\u2019t be justified on the basis of fundamentals and that causes unreasonably high valuations to be assigned.\u201dMr. Marks\u2019s advice echoes what you have heard seemingly forever from Warren E. Buffett and other value investors, and indeed Mr. Marks is one: Buy when everyone else is scared to buy, and worry when everyone else is buying.I have three problems with the book, two small and one more troubling. Let\u2019s start with the small ones.The first is that Mr. Marks has a habit of introducing a point that he wants to emphasize with some variation of \u201cthis is the most important thing you need to know.\u201d I lost track of the number of times he used the construction. Obviously, not everything can be most important.The other nit? This is often not an easy read. Here\u2019s an example: \u201cIt is essential to note that since rational, unemotional investors are very much in the minority, the totality of investors rarely achieve equilibrium regarding their attitudes toward risk, or any of the other aspects of psychology or emotion as to which the cycle oscillates or the pendulum swings.\u201dNow the bigger one. While Mr. Marks does discuss buying stocks for substantially less than their intrinsic value, he and his firm are known for purchasing, among other things, distressed debt, money owed by a company under severe financial pressure, in default or bankruptcy.For example, Mr. Marks says his publicly traded firm made substantial sums during the financial crisis by boldly buying near the bottom of the market. \u201cOaktree invested more than a half a billion dollars a week over the fifteen weeks from September 15 to the end of\u201d 2008 buying debt, he said, and, \u201cThe assets we bought appreciated substantially.\u201dWhy did it buy so heavily? His thinking is consistent with what he advocates for the rest of us. \u201cThe key to profiting lay in recognizing that even in the face of uniformly bad news and a very poor outlook, pessimism can be overdone and thus assets can become too cheap.\u201dBut buying distressed debt is difficult for the average investor. A relatively small number of mutual funds are devoted to it. And while the easiest way would be through a hedge fund that invests heavily in distressed debt, hedge funds usually require investors to have a net worth of at least $1 million not including the value of their home.In other words, Mr. Marks and his firm have resources that are not available to many of us. Those resources allow them to look for bargains where many of us cannot easily go.Mr. Marks is very much an active investor. But passive investing \u2014 an approach where you try to avoid the taxes and fees that come with frequent trading by buying and holding stocks and bonds for the long term \u2014 has always made more sense to me, for one simple reason. It is difficult to outthink both the market and the shrewdest investors \u2014 like Mr. Marks \u2014 who study it.Since that is the case, I am happy to buy index funds, which are designed to match the performance of the market as a whole or a particular segment within it. And since history has shown that the majority of professional managers in any given year fail to outperform the benchmark they are judged against, I feel pretty good about my decision.But there are people who feel compelled to try to exceed market averages. In the words of Mr. Marks\u2019s subtitle, knowing where we stand in a particular market cycle, and equally important, how investors are feeling about it, can, indeed, get \u201cthe odds on your side.\u201d But that assumes you are right about both things. That\u2019s a tall challenge not suited for everyone, as Mr. Marks points out.\u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s entirely reasonable to try to improve long-term performance by altering positions on the basis of the market cycle,\u201d he writes. \u201cBut it\u2019s essential you also understand the limitations as well as the skills that are required and how difficult it is.\u201dThat may be a limitation of his intriguing book, too. It\u2019s got plenty of information, but few people are likely to be able to profit from it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yale\u2019s Endowment Grew 12.3%, Beating Harvard\u2019s but Not Some Others\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike Harvard\u2019s returns, Yale\u2019s exceeded the 8.4 gains that a typical 60-40 portfolio of Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock and aggregate bond index equities would have delivered over the same period, said Jeff Schwartz, president of Markov Processes International, a quantitative research and technology firm.Like Harvard\u2019s, though, Yale\u2019s performance trailed results at prominent rivals like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, whose endowment gained 13.5 percent, and the University of Pennsylvania, which experienced a 12.9 percent increase.Last year, as bonds languished, that approach paid off. The Yale portfolio had roughly 26 percent of its holdings in absolute-return funds, 18 percent in venture capital and roughly 15 percent each in foreign equity and leveraged buyouts, the university said. The rest was invested in real estate, bonds, natural resources and domestic equity.Endowments are crucial to university budgets. In Yale\u2019s case, the endowment provided $1.4 billion, or roughly 34 percent, of net revenue, officials said in a news release.Yale\u2019s results were notable because its strategy has drawn criticism in recent years as returns from equity markets have stayed strong and popular alternative investments like hedge funds have lagged. Over the past decade, the Yale endowment has had an average annual return of 7.4 percent, compared with 8.1 percent for a typical 60-40 portfolio.Mr. Swensen\u2019s critics have argued that it would be better to stick with stocks and bonds and avoid the high fees tied to investing in hedge funds and private equity.No less a figure than Warren E. Buffett has questioned the strategy. In 2016, he wrote in his closely watched letter to Berkshire Hathaway investors that university endowments, like other \u201cfinancial elites,\u201d were wasting money on high fees because they had \u201cgreat trouble meekly signing up for a financial product or service that is available as well to people investing only a few thousand dollars.\u201dMr. Swensen acknowledged the criticism in last year\u2019s endowment report, while also noting that Mr. Buffett had agreed that a small number of investors had the intellect and character to excel while putting their money in alternative investments.Mr. Swensen noted in the news release on Monday that Yale\u2019s endowment had added $33.3 billion more in value over the past 30 years than a 60-40 portfolio would have.Charles Skorina, whose firm does executive searches for chief investment officers for nonprofits and other institutions, said Yale and the rest of the 10 top university endowments with more than $10 billion were doing well relative to simple stock-and-bond portfolios.But, he added, \u201cit has been getting harder for them to find outsize returns in private markets because it is tough to find enough opportunities that will make a significant difference at such large institutions.\u201dYale also said in its release that it had kept its investments in illiquid assets to 50 percent of the portfolio and had targeted a minimum allocation of 30 percent of the endowment to market-insensitive assets. Even in a turbulent market turmoil, it suggested, the university would not have to sell illiquid assets at distressed prices to meet its needs.Yale\u2019s endowment, like those of virtually all the other major universities except Harvard, has historically relied on outside money managers. Harvard, which had managed a big chunk of its funds internally, is now shifting in that direction under a new chief investment officer, N. P. Narvekar.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: This Year\u2019s Stock Gains Are Wiped Out", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatt Phillips of the NYT explains what\u2019s driving the rout:Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.Either way, optimists may find solace in U.S. futures markets trading up slightly this morning, which hints at a brighter start for the day.More from Matt Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman of the NYT:China\u2019s effort is a 21st-century version of what officials there have been doing for many decades, which is trying to influence American leaders by cultivating an informal network of prominent businesspeople and academics who can be sold on ideas and policy prescriptions and then carry them to the White House. The difference now is that China, through its eavesdropping on Mr. Trump\u2019s calls, has a far clearer idea of who carries the most influence with the president, and what arguments tend to work.Combined with the eavesdropping is a lobbying effort by Beijing involving close Trump friends like Steve Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and Steve Wynn, the former casino magnate. One U.S. official told the NYT that the Chinese were pushing for those friends to persuade Mr. Trump to sit down with President Xi Jinping of China as often as possible.The profit will help stabilize Tesla\u2019s finances. But the question now is whether the automaker can continue this success. It has struggled to deliver cars to customers, and it hasn\u2019t yet rolled out its long-promised $35,000 Model 3. More from Mr. Boudette on what could yet happen:If sales falter, the company could quickly find itself in a financial squeeze. It has to make bond payments of $230 million in November and $920 million in March. It can use stock for the second payment but only if its share price is above $360. At the same time, Tesla hopes to build a factory in China, which will require hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenses.The suit, built on three years of investigations, does not charge the company with creating climate change. But it claims that the company essentially kept two sets of books when accounting for the effects of global warming: publicly, it claimed to be ready for stringent regulations, while internally it discounted potential costs of climate policies, prosecutors said. Executives as senior as Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon C.E.O. who later became President Trump\u2019s secretary of state, \u201cknew for years\u201d about the practice, the complaint said.An Exxon spokesman dismissed the lawsuit as \u201cbaseless.\u201d But as the NYT points out, New York attorneys general have had success bringing shareholder fraud lawsuits before, aided by the state\u2019s sweeping Martin Act.At stake isn\u2019t just hundreds of millions of dollars in punishment, but also a reputation that Exxon has tried to shape as a global leader on climate change issues.That starts with cars, said Mr. Khosrowshahi: \u201cIf there\u2019s one big goal for Uber, it\u2019s to replace car ownership.\u201d But Uber is also betting on bike and scooter rentals, food delivery, aircraft, and drones. The goal, he said, is to develop four or five multibillion-dollar businesses.That will come at a cost. Uber is at least a few years away from making money on ride-hailing, and investing in new technologies will require more cash. The company says revenue from mature markets is helping cover costs elsewhere, but prospective investors in its forthcoming I.P.O. will decide if that\u2019s enough to make a bet on its vision.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Trump Engaged in Suspect Tax Schemes as He Reaped Riches From His Father", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "The president has long sold himself as a self-made billionaire, but a Times investigation found that he received at least $413 million in today\u2019s dollars from his father\u2019s real estate empire, much of it through tax dodges in the 1990s.President Trump participated in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud, that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents, an investigation by The New York Times has found.Mr. Trump won the presidency proclaiming himself a self-made billionaire, and he has long insisted that his father, the legendary New York City builder Fred C. Trump, provided almost no financial help.But The Times\u2019s investigation, based on a vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records, reveals that Mr. Trump received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father\u2019s real estate empire, starting when he was a toddler and continuing to this day.Much of this money came to Mr. Trump because he helped his parents dodge taxes. He and his siblings set up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents, records and interviews show. Records indicate that Mr. Trump helped his father take improper tax deductions worth millions more. He also helped formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents\u2019 real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns, sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings.These maneuvers met with little resistance from the Internal Revenue Service, The Times found. The president\u2019s parents, Fred and Mary Trump, transferred well over $1 billion in wealth to their children, which could have produced a tax bill of at least $550 million under the 55 percent tax rate then imposed on gifts and inheritances.The Trumps paid a total of $52.2 million, or about 5 percent, tax records show.The president declined repeated requests over several weeks to comment for this article. But a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Charles J. Harder, provided a written statement on Monday, one day after The Times sent a detailed description of its findings. \u201cThe New York Times\u2019s allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100 percent false, and highly defamatory,\u201d Mr. Harder said. \u201cThere was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone. The facts upon which The Times bases its false allegations are extremely inaccurate.\u201dMr. Harder sought to distance Mr. Trump from the tax strategies used by his family, saying the president had delegated those tasks to relatives and tax professionals. \u201cPresident Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever with these matters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe affairs were handled by other Trump family members who were not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law.\u201dThe president\u2019s brother, Robert Trump, issued a statement on behalf of the Trump family:\u201cOur dear father, Fred C. Trump, passed away in June 1999. Our beloved mother, Mary Anne Trump, passed away in August 2000. All appropriate gift and estate tax returns were filed, and the required taxes were paid. Our father\u2019s estate was closed in 2001 by both the Internal Revenue Service and the New York State tax authorities, and our mother\u2019s estate was closed in 2004. Our family has no other comment on these matters that happened some 20 years ago, and would appreciate your respecting the privacy of our deceased parents, may God rest their souls.\u201dThe Times\u2019s findings raise new questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to release his income tax returns, breaking with decades of practice by past presidents. According to tax experts, it is unlikely that Mr. Trump would be vulnerable to criminal prosecution for helping his parents evade taxes, because the acts happened too long ago and are past the statute of limitations. There is no time limit, however, on civil fines for tax fraud.The findings are based on interviews with Fred Trump\u2019s former employees and advisers and more than 100,000 pages of documents describing the inner workings and immense profitability of his empire. They include documents culled from public sources \u2014 mortgages and deeds, probate records, financial disclosure reports, regulatory records and civil court files.The investigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records \u2014 bank statements, financial audits, accounting ledgers, cash disbursement reports, invoices and canceled checks. Most notably, the documents include more than 200 tax returns from Fred Trump, his companies and various Trump partnerships and trusts. While the records do not include the president\u2019s personal tax returns and reveal little about his recent business dealings at home and abroad, dozens of corporate, partnership and trust tax returns offer the first public accounting of the income he received for decades from various family enterprises.What emerges from this body of evidence is a financial biography of the 45th president fundamentally at odds with the story Mr. Trump has sold in his books, his TV shows and his political life. In Mr. Trump\u2019s version of how he got rich, he was the master dealmaker who broke free of his father\u2019s \u201ctiny\u201d outer-borough operation and parlayed a single $1 million loan from his father (\u201cI had to pay him back with interest!\u201d) into a $10 billion empire that would slap the Trump name on hotels, high-rises, casinos, airlines and golf courses the world over. In Mr. Trump\u2019s version, it was always his guts and gumption that overcame setbacks. Fred Trump was simply a cheerleader.\u201cI built what I built myself,\u201d Mr. Trump has said, a narrative that was long amplified by often-credulous coverage from news organizations, including The Times.Certainly a handful of journalists and biographers, notably Wayne Barrett, Gwenda Blair, David Cay Johnston and Timothy L. O\u2019Brien, have challenged this story, especially the claim of being worth $10 billion. They described how Mr. Trump piggybacked off his father\u2019s banking connections to gain a foothold in Manhattan real estate. They poked holes in his go-to talking point about the $1 million loan, citing evidence that he actually got $14 million. They told how Fred Trump once helped his son make a bond payment on an Atlantic City casino by buying $3.5 million in casino chips.But The Times\u2019s investigation of the Trump family\u2019s finances is unprecedented in scope and precision, offering the first comprehensive look at the inherited fortune and tax dodges that guaranteed Donald J. Trump a gilded life. The reporting makes clear that in every era of Mr. Trump\u2019s life, his finances were deeply intertwined with, and dependent on, his father\u2019s wealth.By age 3, Mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars from his father\u2019s empire. He was a millionaire by age 8. By the time he was 17, his father had given him part ownership of a 52-unit apartment building. Soon after Mr. Trump graduated from college, he was receiving the equivalent of $1 million a year from his father. The money increased with the years, to more than $5 million annually in his 40s and 50s.Fred Trump\u2019s real estate empire was not just scores of apartment buildings. It was also a mountain of cash, tens of millions of dollars in profits building up inside his businesses, banking records show. In one six-year span, from 1988 through 1993, Fred Trump reported $109.7 million in total income, now equivalent to $210.7 million. It was not unusual for tens of millions in Treasury bills and certificates of deposit to flow through his personal bank accounts each month.Fred Trump was relentless and creative in finding ways to channel this wealth to his children. He made Donald not just his salaried employee but also his property manager, landlord, banker and consultant. He gave him loan after loan, many never repaid. He provided money for his car, money for his employees, money to buy stocks, money for his first Manhattan offices and money to renovate those offices. He gave him three trust funds. He gave him shares in multiple partnerships. He gave him $10,000 Christmas checks. He gave him laundry revenue from his buildings.Much of his giving was structured to sidestep gift and inheritance taxes using methods tax experts described to The Times as improper or possibly illegal. Although Fred Trump became wealthy with help from federal housing subsidies, he insisted that it was manifestly unfair for the government to tax his fortune as it passed to his children. When he was in his 80s and beginning to slide into dementia, evading gift and estate taxes became a family affair, with Donald Trump playing a crucial role, interviews and newly obtained documents show.The line between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion is often murky, and it is constantly being stretched by inventive tax lawyers. There is no shortage of clever tax avoidance tricks that have been blessed by either the courts or the I.R.S. itself. The richest Americans almost never pay anything close to full freight. But tax experts briefed on The Times\u2019s findings said the Trumps appeared to have done more than exploit legal loopholes. They said the conduct described here represented a pattern of deception and obfuscation, particularly about the value of Fred Trump\u2019s real estate, that repeatedly prevented the I.R.S. from taxing large transfers of wealth to his children.\u201cThe theme I see here through all of this is valuations: They play around with valuations in extreme ways,\u201d said Lee-Ford Tritt, a University of Florida law professor and a leading expert in gift and estate tax law. \u201cThere are dramatic fluctuations depending on their purpose.\u201dThe manipulation of values to evade taxes was central to one of the most important financial events in Donald Trump\u2019s life. In an episode never before revealed, Mr. Trump and his siblings gained ownership of most of their father\u2019s empire on Nov. 22, 1997, a year and a half before Fred Trump\u2019s death. Critical to the complex transaction was the value put on the real estate. The lower its value, the lower the gift taxes. The Trumps dodged hundreds of millions in gift taxes by submitting tax returns that grossly undervalued the properties, claiming they were worth just $41.4 million.The same set of buildings would be sold off over the next decade for more than 16 times that amount.The most overt fraud was All County Building Supply & Maintenance, a company formed by the Trump family in 1992. All County\u2019s ostensible purpose was to be the purchasing agent for Fred Trump\u2019s buildings, buying everything from boilers to cleaning supplies. It did no such thing, records and interviews show. Instead All County siphoned millions of dollars from Fred Trump\u2019s empire by simply marking up purchases already made by his employees. Those millions, effectively untaxed gifts, then flowed to All County\u2019s owners \u2014 Donald Trump, his siblings and a cousin. Fred Trump then used the padded All County receipts to justify bigger rent increases for thousands of tenants.After this article was published on Tuesday, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance said the agency was \u201creviewing the allegations\u201d and \u201cvigorously pursuing all appropriate areas of investigation.\u201dAll told, The Times documented 295 streams of revenue that Fred Trump created over five decades to enrich his son. In most cases his four other children benefited equally. But over time, as Donald Trump careened from one financial disaster to the next, his father found ways to give him substantially more money, records show. Even so, in 1990, according to previously secret depositions, Mr. Trump tried to have his father\u2019s will rewritten in a way that Fred Trump, alarmed and angered, feared could result in his empire\u2019s being used to bail out his son\u2019s failing businesses.Of course, the story of how Donald Trump got rich cannot be reduced to handouts from his father. Before he became president, his singular achievement was building the brand of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire, a brand so potent it generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue through TV shows, books and licensing deals.Constructing that image required more than Fred Trump\u2019s money. Just as important were his son\u2019s preternatural marketing skills and always-be-closing competitive hustle. While Fred Trump helped finance the accouterments of wealth, Donald Trump, master self-promoter, spun them into a seductive narrative. Fred Trump\u2019s money, for example, helped build Trump Tower, the talisman of privilege that established his son as a major player in New York. But Donald Trump recognized and exploited the iconic power of Trump Tower as a primary stage for both \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and his presidential campaign.The biggest payday he ever got from his father came long after Fred Trump\u2019s death. It happened quietly, without the usual Trumpian news conference, on May 4, 2004, when Mr. Trump and his siblings sold off the empire their father had spent 70 years assembling with the dream that it would never leave his family.Donald Trump\u2019s cut: $177.3 million, or $236.2 million in today\u2019s dollars.Early experience, cultivated connections and a wave of federal housing subsidies helped Fred Trump lay the foundation of his son\u2019s wealth.Before he turned 20, Fred Trump had already built and sold his first home. At age 35, he was building hundreds of houses a year in Brooklyn and Queens. By 45, he was building some of the biggest apartment complexes in the country.Aside from an astonishing work ethic \u2014 \u201cSleeping is a waste of time,\u201d he liked to say \u2014 the growth reflected his shrewd application of mass-production techniques. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle called him \u201cthe Henry Ford of the home-building industry.\u201d He would erect scaffolding a city block long so his masons, sometimes working a second shift under floodlights, could throw up a dozen rowhouses in a week. They sold for about $115,000 in today\u2019s dollars.By 1940, American Builder magazine was taking notice, devoting a spread to Fred Trump under the headline \u201cBiggest One-Man Building Show.\u201d The article described a swaggering lone-wolf character who paid for everything \u2014 wages, supplies, land \u2014 from a thick wad of cash he carried at all times, and whose only help was a secretary answering the phone in an office barely bigger than a parking space. \u201cHe is his own purchasing agent, cashier, paymaster, building superintendent, construction engineer and sales director,\u201d the article said.It wasn\u2019t that simple. Fred Trump had also spent years ingratiating himself with Brooklyn\u2019s Democratic machine, giving money, doing favors and making the sort of friends (like Abraham D. Beame, a future mayor) who could make life easier for a developer. He had also assembled a phalanx of plugged-in real estate lawyers, property appraisers and tax accountants who protected his interests.All these traits \u2014 deep experience, nimbleness, connections, a relentless focus on the efficient construction of homes for the middle class \u2014 positioned him perfectly to ride a growing wave of federal spending on housing. The wave took shape with the New Deal, grew during the World War II rush to build military housing and crested with the postwar imperative to provide homes for returning G.I.s. Fred Trump would become a millionaire many times over by making himself one of the nation\u2019s largest recipients of cheap government-backed building loans, according to Gwenda Blair\u2019s book \u201cThe Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President.\u201dThose same loans became the wellspring of Donald Trump\u2019s wealth. In the late 1940s, Fred Trump obtained roughly $26 million in federal loans to build two of his largest developments, Beach Haven Apartments, near Coney Island, Brooklyn, and Shore Haven Apartments, a few miles away. Then he set about making his children his landlords.As ground lease payments fattened his children\u2019s trusts, Fred Trump embarked on a far bigger transfer of wealth. Records obtained by The Times reveal how he began to build or buy apartment buildings in Brooklyn and Queens and then gradually, without public trace, transfer ownership to his children through a web of partnerships and corporations. In all, Fred Trump put up nearly $13 million in cash and mortgage debt to create a mini-empire within his empire \u2014 eight buildings with 1,032 apartments \u2014 that he would transfer to his children.The handover began just before Donald Trump\u2019s 16th birthday. On June 1, 1962, Fred Trump transferred a plot of land in Queens to a newly created corporation. While he would be its president, his children would be its owners, records show. Then he constructed a 52-unit building called Clyde Hall.It was easy money for the Trump children. Their father took care of everything. He bought the land, built the apartments and obtained the mortgages. His employees managed the building. The profits, meanwhile, went to his children. By the early 1970s, Fred Trump would execute similar transfers of the other seven buildings.The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.For Donald Trump, this meant a rapidly growing new source of income. When he was in high school, his cut of the profits was about $17,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars. His share exceeded $300,000 a year soon after he graduated from college.How Fred Trump transferred 1,032 apartments to his children without incurring hundreds of thousands of dollars in gift taxes is unclear. A review of property records for the eight buildings turned up no evidence that his children bought them outright. Financial records obtained by The Times reveal only that all of the shares in the partnerships and corporations set up to create the mini-empire shifted at some point from Fred Trump to his children. Yet his tax returns show he paid no gift taxes on seven of the buildings, and only a few thousand dollars on the eighth.That building, Sunnyside Towers, a 158-unit property in Queens, illustrates Fred Trump\u2019s catch-me-if-you-can approach with the I.R.S., which had repeatedly cited him for underpaying taxes in the 1950s and 1960s.Donald Trump went to work for his father after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. His father made him vice president of dozens of companies. This was also the moment Fred Trump telegraphed what had become painfully obvious to his family and employees: He did not consider his eldest son, Fred Trump Jr., a viable heir apparent.Fred Jr., seven and a half years older than Donald, had also worked for his father after college. It did not go well, relatives and former employees said in interviews. Fred Trump openly ridiculed him for being too nice, too soft, too lazy, too fond of drink. He frowned on his interests in flying and music, could not fathom why he cared so little for the family business. Donald, witness to his father\u2019s deepening disappointment, fashioned himself Fred Jr.\u2019s opposite \u2014 the brash tough guy with a killer instinct. His reward was to inherit his father\u2019s dynastic dreams.Fred Trump began taking steps that enriched Donald alone, introducing him to the charms of building with cheap government loans. In 1972, father and son formed a partnership to build a high-rise for the elderly in East Orange, N.J. Thanks to government subsidies, the partnership got a nearly interest-free $7.8 million loan that covered 90 percent of construction costs. Fred Trump paid the rest.But his son received most of the financial benefits, records show. On top of profit distributions and consulting fees, Donald Trump was paid to manage the building, though Fred Trump\u2019s employees handled day-to-day management. He also pocketed what tenants paid to rent air-conditioners. By 1975, Donald Trump\u2019s take from the building was today\u2019s equivalent of nearly $305,000 a year.Fred Trump also gave his son an extra boost through his investment, in the early 1970s, in the sprawling Starrett City development in Brooklyn, the largest federally subsidized housing project in the nation. The investment, which promised to generate huge tax write-offs, was tailor-made for Fred Trump; he would use Starrett City\u2019s losses to avoid taxes on profits from his empire.Fred Trump invested $5 million. A separate partnership established for his children invested $1 million more, showering tax breaks on the Trump children for decades to come. They helped Donald Trump avoid paying any federal income taxes at all in 1978 and 1979. But Fred Trump also deputized him to sell a sliver of his Starrett City shares, a sweetheart deal that generated today\u2019s equivalent of more than $1 million in \u201cconsulting fees.\u201dThe money from consulting and management fees, ground leases, the mini-empire and his salary all combined to make Donald Trump indisputably wealthy years before he sold his first Manhattan apartment. By 1975, when he was 29, he had collected nearly $9 million in today\u2019s dollars from his father, The Times found.Wealthy, yes. But a far cry from the image father and son craved for Donald Trump.Fred Trump would play a crucial role in building and carefully maintaining the myth of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire.\u201cHe is tall, lean and blond, with dazzling white teeth, and he looks ever so much like Robert Redford. He rides around town in a chauffeured silver Cadillac with his initials, DJT, on the plates. He dates slinky fashion models, belongs to the most elegant clubs and, at only 30 years of age, estimates that he is worth \u2018more than $200 million.\u2019\u201dIn the chauffeured Cadillac, Donald Trump took The Times\u2019s reporter on a tour of what he called his \u201cjobs.\u201d He told her about the Manhattan hotel he planned to convert into a Grand Hyatt (his father guaranteed the construction loan), and the Hudson River railroad yards he planned to develop (the rights were purchased by his father\u2019s company). He showed her \u201cour philanthropic endeavor,\u201d the high-rise for the elderly in East Orange (bankrolled by his father), and an apartment complex on Staten Island (owned by his father), and their \u201cflagship,\u201d Trump Village, in Brooklyn (owned by his father), and finally Beach Haven Apartments (owned by his father). Even the Cadillac was leased by his father.\u201cSo far,\u201d he boasted, \u201cI\u2019ve never made a bad deal.\u201dIt was a spectacular con, right down to the priceless moment when Mr. Trump confessed that he was \u201cpublicity shy.\u201d By claiming his father\u2019s wealth as his own, Donald Trump transformed his place in the world. A brash 30-year-old playboy worth more than $200 million proved irresistible to New York City\u2019s bankers, politicians and journalists.Yet for all the spin about cutting his own path in Manhattan, Donald Trump was increasingly dependent on his father. Weeks after The Times\u2019s profile ran, Fred Trump set up still more trusts for his children, seeding each with today\u2019s equivalent of $4.3 million. Even into the early 1980s, when he was already proclaiming himself one of America\u2019s richest men, Donald Trump remained on his father\u2019s payroll, drawing an annual salary of $260,000 in today\u2019s dollars.In theory, the money had to be repaid. In practice, records show, many of the loans were more like gifts. Some were interest-free and had no repayment schedule. Even when loans charged interest, Donald Trump frequently skipped payments.This previously unreported flood of loans highlights a clear pattern to Fred Trump\u2019s largess. When Donald Trump began expensive new projects, his father increased his help. In the late 1970s, when Donald Trump was converting the old Commodore Hotel into a Grand Hyatt, his father stepped up with a spigot of loans. Fred Trump did the same with Trump Tower in the early 1980s.In the mid-1980s, as Donald Trump made his first forays into Atlantic City, Fred Trump devised a plan that sharply increased the flow of money to his son.The plan involved the mini-empire \u2014 the eight buildings Fred Trump had transferred to his children. He converted seven of them into cooperatives, and helped his children convert the eighth. That meant inviting tenants to buy their apartments, generating a three-way windfall for Donald Trump and his siblings: from selling units, from renting unsold units and from collecting mortgage payments.In 1982, Donald Trump made today\u2019s equivalent of about $380,000 from the eight buildings. As the conversions continued and Fred Trump\u2019s employees sold off more units, his son\u2019s share of profits jumped, records show. By 1987, with the conversions completed, his son was making today\u2019s equivalent of $4.5 million a year off the eight buildings.Fred Trump made one other structural change to his empire that produced a big new source of revenue for Donald Trump and his siblings. He made them his bankers.The Times could find no evidence that the Trump children had to come up with money of their own to buy their father\u2019s mortgages. Most were purchased from Fred Trump\u2019s banks by trusts and partnerships that he set up and seeded with money.Co-op sales, mortgage payments, ground leases \u2014 Fred Trump was a master at finding ways to enrich his children in general and Donald Trump in particular. Some ways were like slow-moving creeks. Others were rushing streams. A few were geysers. But as the decades passed they all joined into one mighty river of money. By 1990, The Times found, Fred Trump, the ultimate silent partner, had quietly transferred today\u2019s equivalent of at least $46.2 million to his son.Donald Trump took on a mien of invincibility. The stock market crashed in 1987 and the economy cratered. But he doubled down thanks in part to Fred Trump\u2019s banks, which eagerly extended credit to the young Trump princeling. He bought the Plaza Hotel in 1988 for $407.5 million. He bought the Eastern Airlines shuttle fleet in 1989 for $365 million and called it Trump Shuttle. His newest casino, the Trump Taj Mahal, would need at least $1 million a day just to cover its debt.The skeptics who questioned the wisdom of this debt-fueled spending spree were drowned out by one magazine cover after another marveling at someone so young taking such breathtaking risks. But whatever Donald Trump was gambling, not for one second was he at risk of losing out on a lifetime of frictionless, effortless wealth. Fred Trump had that bet covered.Bailouts, collateral, cash on hand \u2014 Fred Trump was prepared, and was not about to let bad bets sink his son.As the 1980s ended, Donald Trump\u2019s big bets began to go bust. Trump Shuttle was failing to make loan payments within 15 months. The Plaza, drowning in debt, was bankrupt in four years. His Atlantic City casinos, also drowning in debt, tumbled one by one into bankruptcy.Fred Trump\u2019s generosity also provided a crucial backstop when his son pleaded with bankers in 1990 for an emergency line of credit. With so many of his projects losing money, Donald Trump had few viable assets of his own making to pledge as collateral. What has never been publicly known is that he used his stakes in the mini-empire and the high-rise for the elderly in East Orange as collateral to help secure a $65 million loan.Fred Trump, former employees say, detested taking unnecessary distributions from his companies because he would have to pay income taxes on them. So why would a penny-pinching, tax-hating 85-year-old in the twilight of his career abruptly pull so much money out of his cherished properties, incurring a tax bill of $12.2 million?The Times found no evidence that Fred Trump made any significant debt payments or charitable donations. The frugality he brought to business carried over to the rest of his life. According to ledgers of his personal spending, he spent a grand total of $8,562 in 1991 and 1992 on travel and entertainment. His extravagances, such as they were, consisted of buying his wife the odd gift from Antonovich Furs or hosting family celebrations at the Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn. His home on Midland Parkway in Jamaica Estates, Queens, built with unfussy brick like so many of his apartment buildings, had little to distinguish it from neighboring houses beyond the white columns and crest framing the front door.There are, however, indications that he wanted plenty of cash on hand to bail out his son if need be.Such was the case with the rescue mission at his son\u2019s Trump\u2019s Castle casino. Donald Trump had wildly overspent on renovations, leaving the property dangerously low on operating cash. Sure enough, neither Trump\u2019s Castle nor its owner had the necessary funds to make an $18.4 million bond payment due in December 1990.With this ruse \u2014 it was an illegal $3.5 million loan under New Jersey gaming laws, resulting in a $65,000 civil penalty \u2014 Donald Trump narrowly avoided defaulting on his bonds.Both the son and the father were masters of manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs.As the chip episode demonstrated, father and son were of one mind about rules and regulations, viewing them as annoyances to be finessed or, when necessary, ignored. As described by family members and associates in interviews and sworn testimony, theirs was an intimate, endless confederacy sealed by blood, shared secrets and a Hobbesian view of what it took to dominate and win. They talked almost daily and saw each other most weekends. Donald Trump sat at his father\u2019s right hand at family meals and participated in his father\u2019s monthly strategy sessions with his closest advisers. Fred Trump was a silent, watchful presence at many of Donald Trump\u2019s news conferences.\u201cI probably knew my father as well or better than anybody,\u201d Donald Trump said in a 2000 deposition.They were both fluent in the language of half-truths and lies, interviews and records show. They both delighted in transgressing without getting caught. They were both wizards at manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs.Those talents came in handy when Fred Trump Jr. died, on Sept. 26, 1981, at age 42 from complications of alcoholism, leaving a son and a daughter. The executors of his estate were his father and his brother Donald.Fred Trump Jr.\u2019s largest asset was his stake in seven of the eight buildings his father had transferred to his children. The Trumps would claim that those properties were worth $90.4 million when they finished converting them to cooperatives within a few years of his death. At that value, his stake could have generated an estate tax bill of nearly $10 million.This fantastical claim \u2014 that Park Briar should be taxed as if its value had fallen 83 percent in 18 days \u2014 slid past the I.R.S. with barely a protest. An auditor insisted the value should be increased by $100,000, to $3 million.During the 1980s, Donald Trump became notorious for leaking word that he was taking positions in stocks, hinting of a possible takeover, and then either selling on the run-up or trying to extract lucrative concessions from the target company to make him go away. It was a form of stock manipulation with an unsavory label: \u201cgreenmailing.\u201d The Times unearthed evidence that Mr. Trump enlisted his father as his greenmailing wingman.On Jan. 26, 1989, Fred Trump bought 8,600 shares of Time Inc. for $934,854, his tax returns show. Seven days later, Dan Dorfman, a financial columnist known to be chatty with Donald Trump, broke the news that the younger Trump had \u201ctaken a sizable stake\u201d in Time. Sure enough, Time\u2019s shares jumped, allowing Fred Trump to make a $41,614 profit in two weeks.Later that year, Fred Trump bought $5 million worth of American Airlines stock. Based on the share price \u2014 $81.74 \u2014 it appears he made the purchase shortly before Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump was taking a stake in the company. Within weeks, the stock was over $100 a share. Had Fred Trump sold then, he would have made a quick $1.3 million. But he didn\u2019t, and the stock sank amid skepticism about his son\u2019s history of hyped takeover attempts that fizzled. Fred Trump sold his shares for a $1.7 million loss in January 1990. A week later, Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump had sold, too.With other family members, Fred Trump could be cantankerous and cruel, according to sworn testimony by his relatives. \u201cThis is the stupidest thing I ever heard of,\u201d he\u2019d snap when someone disappointed him. He was different with his son Donald. He might chide him \u2014 \u201cFinish this job before you start that job,\u201d he\u2019d counsel \u2014 but more often, he looked for ways to forgive and accommodate.By 1987, for example, Donald Trump\u2019s loan debt to his father had grown to at least $11 million. Yet canceling the debt would have required Donald Trump to pay millions in taxes on the amount forgiven. Father and son found another solution, one never before disclosed, that appears to constitute both an unreported multimillion-dollar gift and a potentially illegal tax write-off.In December 1987, records show, Fred Trump bought a 7.5 percent stake in Trump Palace, a 55-story condominium building his son was erecting on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Most, if not all, of his investment, which totaled $15.5 million, was made by exchanging his son\u2019s unpaid debts for Trump Palace shares, records show.Under state law, developers must file \u201coffering plans\u201d that identify to any potential condo buyer the project\u2019s sponsors \u2014 in other words, its owners. The Trump Palace offering plan, submitted in November 1989, identified two owners: Donald Trump and his father. But under the same law, if Fred Trump had sold his stake to a third party, Donald Trump would have been required to identify the new owner in an amended offering plan filed with the state attorney general\u2019s office. He did not do that, records show.He did, however, sign a sworn affidavit a month after his father sold his stake. In the affidavit, submitted in a lawsuit over a Trump Palace contractor\u2019s unpaid bill, Donald Trump identified himself as \u201cthe\u201d owner of Trump Palace.Under I.R.S. rules, selling shares worth $15.5 million to your son for $10,000 is tantamount to giving him a $15.49 million taxable gift. Fred Trump reported no such gift.According to tax experts, the only circumstance that would not have required Fred Trump to report a gift was if Trump Palace had been effectively bankrupt when he unloaded his shares.Yet Trump Palace was far from bankrupt.Property records show that condo sales there were brisk in 1991. Trump Palace sold 57 condos for $52.5 million \u2014 94 percent of the total asking price for those units.By failing to tell the I.R.S. about his $15.49 million gift to his son, Fred Trump evaded the 55 percent tax on gifts, saving about $8 million. At the same time, he declared to the I.R.S. that Trump Palace was almost a complete loss \u2014 that he had walked away from a $15.5 million investment with just $10,000 to show for it.Federal tax law prohibits deducting any loss from the sale of property between members of the same family, because of the potential for abuse. Yet Fred Trump appears to have done exactly that, dodging roughly $5 million more in income taxes.The partnership between Fred and Donald Trump was not simply about the pursuit of riches. At its heart lay a more ambitious project, executed to perfection over decades \u2014 to create that origin story, the myth of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire.Donald Trump built the foundation for the myth in the 1970s by appropriating his father\u2019s empire as his own. By the late 1980s, instead of appropriating the empire, he was diminishing it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great business, it was a good business,\u201d he said, as if Fred Trump ran a chain of laundromats. Yes, he told interviewers, his father was a wonderful mentor, but given the limits of his business, the most he could manage was a $1 million loan, and even that had to be repaid with interest.Donald Trump tried to change his ailing father\u2019s will, prompting a backlash \u2014 but also a recognition that plans had to be set in motion before Fred Trump died.Fred Trump had given careful thought to what would become of his empire after he died, and had hired one of the nation\u2019s top estate lawyers to draft his will. But in December 1990, Donald Trump sent his father a document, drafted by one of his own lawyers, that sought to make significant changes to that will.Fred Trump, then 85, had never before set eyes on the document, 12 pages of dense legalese. Nor had he authorized its preparation. Nor had he met the lawyer who drafted it.Yet his son sent instructions that he needed to sign it immediately.What happened next was described years later in sworn depositions by members of the Trump family during a dispute, later settled, over the inheritance Fred Trump left to Fred Jr.\u2019s children. These depositions, obtained by The Times, reveal something startling: Fred Trump believed that the document potentially put his life\u2019s work at risk.As close as they were \u2014 or perhaps because they were so close \u2014 Fred Trump did not immediately confront his son. Instead he turned to his daughter Maryanne Trump Barry, then a federal judge whom he often consulted on legal matters. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t pass the smell test,\u201d he told her, she recalled during her deposition. When Judge Barry read the codicil, she reached the same conclusion. \u201cDonald was in precarious financial straits by his own admission,\u201d she said, \u201cand Dad was very concerned as a man who worked hard for his money and never wanted any of it to leave the family.\u201d (In a brief telephone interview, Judge Barry declined to comment.)Fred Trump took prompt action to thwart his son. He dispatched his daughter to find new estate lawyers. One of them took notes on the instructions she passed on from her father: \u201cProtect assets from DJT, Donald\u2019s creditors.\u201d The lawyers quickly drafted a new codicil stripping Donald Trump of sole control over his father\u2019s estate. Fred Trump signed it immediately.Clumsy as it was, Donald Trump\u2019s failed attempt to change his father\u2019s will brought a family reckoning about two related issues: Fred Trump\u2019s declining health and his reluctance to relinquish ownership of his empire. Surgeons had removed a neck tumor a few years earlier, and he would soon endure hip replacement surgery and be found to have mild senile dementia. Yet for all the financial support he had lavished on his children, for all his abhorrence of taxes, Fred Trump had stubbornly resisted his advisers\u2019 recommendations to transfer ownership of his empire to the children to minimize estate taxes.With every passing year, the actuarial odds increased that Fred Trump would die owning apartment buildings worth many hundreds of millions of dollars, all of it exposed to the 55 percent estate tax. Just as exposed was the mountain of cash he was sitting on. His buildings, well maintained and carrying little debt, consistently produced millions of dollars a year in profits. Even after he paid himself $109.7 million from 1988 through 1993, his companies were holding $50 million in cash and investments, financial records show. Tens of millions of dollars more passed each month through a maze of personal accounts at Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, UBS, Bowery Savings and United Mizrahi, an Israeli bank.Simply put, without immediate action, Fred Trump\u2019s heirs faced the prospect of losing hundreds of millions of dollars to estate taxes.Whatever their differences, the Trumps formulated a plan to avoid this fate. How they did it is a story never before told.It is also a story in which Donald Trump played a central role. He took the lead in strategy sessions where the plan was devised with the consent and participation of his father and his father\u2019s closest advisers, people who attended the meetings told The Times. Robert Trump, the youngest sibling and the beta to Donald\u2019s alpha, was given the task of overseeing day-to-day details. After years of working for his brother, Robert Trump went to work for his father in late 1991.The Trumps\u2019 plan, executed over the next decade, blended traditional techniques \u2014 such as rewriting Fred Trump\u2019s will to maximize tax avoidance \u2014 with unorthodox strategies that tax experts told The Times were legally dubious and, in some cases, appeared to be fraudulent. As a result, the Trump children would gain ownership of virtually all of their father\u2019s buildings without having to pay a penny of their own. They would turn the mountain of cash into a molehill of cash. And hundreds of millions of dollars that otherwise would have gone to the United States Treasury would instead go to Fred Trump\u2019s children.A family company let Fred Trump funnel money to his children by effectively overcharging himself for repairs and improvements on his properties. All County had no corporate offices. Its address was the Manhasset, N.Y., home of John Walter, a favorite nephew of Fred Trump\u2019s. Mr. Walter, who died in January, spent decades working for Fred Trump, primarily helping computerize his payroll and billing systems. He also was the unofficial keeper of Fred Trump\u2019s personal and business papers, his basement crowded with boxes of old Trump financial records. John Walter and the four Trump children each owned 20 percent of All County, records show.All County\u2019s main purpose, The Times found, was to enable Fred Trump to make large cash gifts to his children and disguise them as legitimate business transactions, thus evading the 55 percent tax.The way it worked was remarkably simple.Each year Fred Trump spent millions of dollars maintaining and improving his properties. Some of the vendors who supplied his building superintendents and maintenance crews had been cashing Fred Trump\u2019s checks for decades. Starting in August 1992, though, a different name began to appear on their checks \u2014 All County Building Supply & Maintenance.Mr. Walter\u2019s computer systems, meanwhile, churned out All County invoices that billed Fred Trump\u2019s empire for those same services and supplies, with one difference: All County\u2019s invoices were padded, marked up by 20 percent, or 50 percent, or even more, records show.The Trump siblings split the markup, along with Mr. Walter.Years later, in his deposition during the dispute over Fred Trump\u2019s estate, Robert Trump would say that All County actually saved Fred Trump money by negotiating better deals. Given Fred Trump\u2019s long experience expertly squeezing better prices out of contractors, it was a surprising claim. It was also not true.The Times\u2019s examination of thousands of pages of financial documents from Fred Trump\u2019s buildings shows that his costs shot up once All County entered the picture.Beach Haven Apartments illustrates how this happened: In 1991 and 1992, Fred Trump bought 78 refrigerator-stove combinations for Beach Haven from Long Island Appliance Wholesalers. The average price was $642.69. But in 1993, when he began paying All County for refrigerator-stove combinations, the price jumped by 46 percent. Likewise, the price he paid for trash-compacting services at Beach Haven increased 64 percent. Janitorial supplies went up more than 100 percent. Plumbing repairs and supplies rose 122 percent. And on it went in building after building. The more Fred Trump paid, the more All County made, which was precisely the plan.While All County systematically overcharged Fred Trump for thousands of items, the job of negotiating with vendors fell, as it always had, to Fred Trump and his staff.Leon Eastmond can attest to this.Mr. Eastmond is the owner of A. L. Eastmond & Sons, a Bronx company that makes industrial boilers. In 1993, he and Fred Trump met at Gargiulo\u2019s, an old-school Italian restaurant in Coney Island that was one of Fred Trump\u2019s favorites, to hash out the price of 60 boilers. Fred Trump, accompanied by his secretary and Robert Trump, drove a hard bargain. After negotiating a 10 percent discount, he made one last demand: \u201cI had to pay the tab,\u201d Mr. Eastmond recalled with a chuckle.There was no mention of All County. Mr. Eastmond first heard of the company when its checks started rolling in. \u201cI remember opening my mail one day and out came a check for $100,000,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize the company. I didn\u2019t know who the hell they were.\u201dAll County\u2019s owners devised another ruse to profit off Mr. Eastmond\u2019s boilers. To win Fred Trump\u2019s business, Mr. Eastmond had also agreed to provide mobile boilers for Fred Trump\u2019s buildings free of charge while new boilers were being installed. Yet All County charged Fred Trump rent on the same mobile boilers Mr. Eastmond was providing free, along with hookup fees, disconnection fees, transportation fees and operating and maintenance fees, records show. These charges siphoned hundreds of thousands of dollars more from Fred Trump\u2019s empire.Mr. Walter, asked during a deposition why Fred Trump chose not to make himself one of All County\u2019s owners, replied, \u201cHe said because he would have to pay a death tax on it.\u201dAfter being briefed on All County by The Times, Mr. Tritt, the University of Florida law professor, said the Trumps\u2019 use of the company was \u201chighly suspicious\u201d and could constitute criminal tax fraud. \u201cIt certainly looks like a disguised gift,\u201d he said.While All County was all upside for Donald Trump and his siblings, it had an insidious downside for Fred Trump\u2019s tenants.As an owner of rent-stabilized buildings in New York, Fred Trump needed state approval to raise rents beyond the annual increases set by a government board. One way to justify a rent increase was to make a major capital improvement. It did not take much to get approval; an invoice or canceled check would do if the expense seemed reasonable.The Trumps used the padded All County invoices to justify higher rent increases in Fred Trump\u2019s rent-regulated buildings. Fred Trump, according to Mr. Walter, saw All County as a way to have his cake and eat it, too. If he used his \u201cexpert negotiating ability\u201d to buy a $350 refrigerator for $200, he could raise the rent based only on that $200, not on the $350 sticker price \u201ca normal person\u201d would pay, Mr. Walter explained. All County was the way around this problem. \u201cYou have to understand the thinking that went behind this,\u201d he said.As Robert Trump acknowledged in his deposition, \u201cThe higher the markup would be, the higher the rent that might be charged.\u201dState records show that after All County\u2019s creation, the Trumps got approval to raise rents on thousands of apartments by claiming more than $30 million in major capital improvements. Tenants repeatedly protested the increases, almost always to no avail, the records show.One of the improvements most often cited by the Trumps: new boilers.Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, disputed The Times\u2019s reporting: \u201cShould The Times state or imply that President Trump participated in fraud, tax evasion or any other crime, it will be exposing itself to substantial liability and damages for defamation.\u201dOn Jan. 21, 1994, they created a company called Apartment Management Associates Inc., with a mailing address at Mr. Walter\u2019s Manhasset home. Two months later, records show, Apartment Management started collecting fees that had previously gone to Trump Management.The only difference was that Donald Trump and his siblings owned Apartment Management.But these savings were trivial compared with those that would come when Fred Trump transferred his empire \u2014 the actual bricks and mortar \u2014 to his children.The transfer of most of Fred Trump\u2019s empire to his children began with a \u2018friendly\u2019 appraisal and an incredible shrinking act.Six months later, on Nov. 22, the Trumps began transferring ownership of most of Fred Trump\u2019s empire. (A few properties were excluded.) The instrument they used to do this was a special type of trust with a clunky acronym only a tax lawyer could love: GRAT, short for grantor-retained annuity trust.GRATs are one of the tax code\u2019s great gifts to the ultrawealthy. They let dynastic families like the Trumps pass wealth from one generation to the next \u2014 be it stocks, real estate, even art collections \u2014 without paying a dime of estate taxes.The details are numbingly complex, but the mechanics are straightforward. For the Trumps, it meant putting half the properties to be transferred into a GRAT in Fred Trump\u2019s name and the other half into a GRAT in his wife\u2019s name. Then Fred and Mary Trump gave their children roughly two-thirds of the assets in their GRATs. The children bought the remaining third by making annuity payments to their parents over the next two years. By Nov. 22, 1997, it was done; the Trump children owned nearly all of Fred Trump\u2019s empire free and clear of estate taxes.As for gift taxes, the Trumps found a way around those, too.The entire transaction turned on one number: the market value of Fred Trump\u2019s empire. This determined the amount of gift taxes Fred and Mary Trump owed for the portion of the empire they gave to their children. It also determined the amount of annuity payments their children owed for the rest.The I.R.S. recognizes that GRATs create powerful incentives to greatly undervalue assets, especially when those assets are not publicly traded stocks with transparent prices. Indeed, every $10 million reduction in the valuation of Fred Trump\u2019s empire would save the Trumps either $10 million in annuity payments or $5.5 million in gift taxes. This is why the I.R.S. requires families taking advantage of GRATs to submit independent appraisals and threatens penalties for those who lowball valuations.In practice, though, gift tax returns get little scrutiny from the I.R.S. It is an open secret among tax practitioners that evasion of gift taxes is rampant and rarely prosecuted. Punishment, such as it is, usually consists of an auditor\u2019s requiring a tax payment closer to what should have been paid in the first place. \u201cGRATs are typically structured so that no tax is due, which means the I.R.S. has reduced incentive to audit them,\u201d said Mitchell Gans, a professor of tax law at Hofstra University. \u201cSo if a gift is in fact undervalued, it may very well go unnoticed.\u201dThis appears to be precisely what the Trumps were counting on. The Times found evidence that the Trumps dodged hundreds of millions of dollars in gift taxes by submitting tax returns that grossly undervalued the real estate assets they placed in Fred and Mary Trump\u2019s GRATs.The methods the Trumps used to pull off this incredible shrinking act were hatched in the strategy sessions Donald Trump participated in during the early 1990s, documents and interviews show. Their basic strategy had two components: Get what is widely known as a \u201cfriendly\u201d appraisal of the empire\u2019s worth, then drive that number even lower by changing the ownership structure to make the empire look less valuable to the I.R.S.A crucial step was finding a property appraiser attuned to their needs. As anyone who has ever bought or sold a home knows, appraisers can arrive at sharply different valuations depending on their methods and assumptions. And like stock analysts, property appraisers have been known to massage those methods and assumptions in ways that coincide with their clients\u2019 interests.The Trumps used Robert Von Ancken, a favorite of New York City\u2019s big real estate families. Over a 45-year career, Mr. Von Ancken has appraised many of the city\u2019s landmarks, including Rockefeller Center, the World Trade Center, the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. Donald Trump recruited him after Fred Trump Jr. died and the family needed friendly appraisals to help shield the estate from taxes.Mr. Von Ancken appraised the 25 apartment complexes and other properties in the Trumps\u2019 GRATs and concluded that their total value was $93.9 million, tax records show.To assess the accuracy of those valuations, The Times examined the prices paid for comparable apartment buildings that sold within a year of Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s appraisals. A pattern quickly emerged. Again and again, buildings in the same neighborhood as Trump buildings sold for two to four times as much per square foot as Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s appraisals, even when the buildings were decades older, had fewer amenities and smaller apartments, and were deemed less valuable by city property tax appraisers.Mr. Von Ancken valued Argyle Hall, a six-story brick Trump building in Brooklyn, at $9.04 per square foot. Six blocks away, another six-story brick building, two decades older, had sold a few months earlier for nearly $30 per square foot. He valued Belcrest Hall, a Trump building in Queens, at $8.57 per square foot. A few blocks away, another six-story brick building, four decades older with apartments a third smaller, sold for $25.18 per square foot.The pattern persisted with Fred Trump\u2019s higher-end buildings. Mr. Von Ancken appraised Lawrence Towers, a Trump building in Brooklyn with spacious balcony apartments, at $24.54 per square foot. A few months earlier, an apartment building abutting car repair shops a mile away, with units 20 percent smaller, had sold for $48.23 per square foot.The Times found even starker discrepancies when comparing the GRAT appraisals against appraisals commissioned by the Trumps when they had an incentive to show the highest possible valuations.Such was the case with Patio Gardens, a complex of nearly 500 apartments in Brooklyn.Of all Fred Trump\u2019s properties, Patio Gardens was one of the least profitable, which may be why he decided to use it as a tax deduction. In 1992, he donated Patio Gardens to the National Kidney Foundation of New York/New Jersey, one of the largest charitable donations he ever made. The greater the value of Patio Gardens, the bigger his deduction. The appraisal cited in Fred Trump\u2019s 1992 tax return valued Patio Gardens at $34 million, or $61.90 a square foot.By contrast, Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s GRAT appraisals found that the crown jewels of Fred Trump\u2019s empire, Beach Haven and Shore Haven, with five times as many apartments as Patio Gardens, were together worth just $23 million, or $11.01 per square foot.In an interview, Mr. Von Ancken said that because neither he nor The Times had the working papers that described how he arrived at his valuations, there was simply no way to evaluate the methodologies behind his numbers. \u201cThere would be explanations within the appraisals to justify all the values,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBasically, when we prepare these things, we feel that these are going to be presented to the Internal Revenue Service for their review, and they better be right.\u201dOf all the GRAT appraisals Mr. Von Ancken did for the Trumps, the most startling was for 886 rental apartments in two buildings at Trump Village, a complex in Coney Island. Mr. Von Ancken claimed that they were worth less than nothing \u2014 negative $5.9 million, to be exact. These were the same 886 units that city tax assessors valued that same year at $38.1 million, and that a bank would value at $106.6 million in 2004.It appears Mr. Von Ancken arrived at his negative valuation by departing from the methodology that he has repeatedly testified is most appropriate for properties like Trump Village, where past years\u2019 profits are a poor gauge of future value.In 1992, the Trumps had removed the two Trump Village buildings from an affordable housing program so they could raise rents and increase their profits. But doing so cost them a property tax exemption, which temporarily put the buildings in the red. The methodology described by Mr. Von Ancken would have disregarded this blip into the red and valued the buildings based on the higher rents the Trumps would be charging. Mr. Von Ancken, however, appears to have based his valuation on the blip, producing an appraisal that, taken at face value, meant Fred Trump would have had to pay someone millions of dollars to take the property off his hands.Mr. Von Ancken told The Times that he did not recall which appraisal method he used on the two Trump Village buildings. \u201cI can only say that we value the properties based on market information, and based on the expected income and expenses of the building and what they would sell for,\u201d he said. As for the enormous gaps between his valuation and the 1995 city property tax appraisal and the 2004 bank valuation, he argued that such comparisons were pointless. \u201cI can\u2019t say what happened afterwards,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they increased the income tremendously.\u201dTo further whittle the empire\u2019s valuation, the family created the appearance that Fred Trump held only 49.8 percent.Armed with Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s $93.9 million appraisal, the Trumps focused on slashing even this valuation by changing the ownership structure of Fred Trump\u2019s empire.The I.R.S. has long accepted the idea that ownership with control is more valuable than ownership without control. Someone with a controlling interest in a building can decide if and when the building is sold, how it is marketed and what price to accept. However, since someone who owns, say, 10 percent of a $100 million building lacks control over any of those decisions, the I.R.S. will let him claim that his stake should be taxed as if it were worth only $7 million or $8 million.But Fred Trump had exercised total control over his empire for more than seven decades. With rare exceptions, he owned 100 percent of his buildings. So the Trumps set out to create the fiction that Fred Trump was a minority owner. All it took was splitting the ownership structure of his empire. Fred and Mary Trump each ended up with 49.8 percent of the corporate entities that owned his buildings. The other 0.4 percent was split among their four children.Splitting ownership into minority interests is a widely used method of tax avoidance. There is one circumstance, however, where it has at times been found to be illegal. It involves what is known in tax law as the step transaction doctrine \u2014 where it can be shown that the corporate restructuring was part of a rapid sequence of seemingly separate maneuvers actually conceived and executed to dodge taxes. A key issue, according to tax experts, is timing \u2014 in the Trumps\u2019 case, whether they split up Fred Trump\u2019s empire just before they set up the GRATs.In all, the Trumps broke up 12 corporate entities to create the appearance of minority ownership. The Times could not determine when five of the 12 companies were divided. But records reveal that the other seven were split up just before the GRATs were established.The pattern was clear. For decades, the companies had been owned solely by Fred Trump, each operating a different apartment complex or shopping center. In September 1995, the Trumps formed seven new limited liability companies. Between Oct. 31 and Nov. 8, they transferred the deeds to the seven properties into their respective L.L.C.\u2019s. On Nov. 21, they recorded six of the deed transfers in public property records. (The seventh was recorded on Nov. 24.) And on Nov. 22, 49.8 percent of the shares in these seven L.L.C.\u2019s was transferred into Fred Trump\u2019s GRAT and 49.8 percent into Mary Trump\u2019s GRAT.That enabled the Trumps to slash Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s valuation in a way that was legally dubious. They claimed that Fred and Mary Trump\u2019s status as minority owners, plus the fact that a building couldn\u2019t be sold as easily as a share of stock, entitled them to lop 45 percent off Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s $93.9 million valuation. This claim, combined with $18.3 million more in standard deductions, completed the alchemy of turning real estate that would soon be valued at nearly $900 million into $41.4 million.According to tax experts, claiming a 45 percent discount was questionable even back then, and far higher than the 20 to 30 percent discount the I.R.S. would allow today.The I.R.S. determined that the Trumps\u2019 assets were worth $57.1 million, 38 percent more than the couple had claimed. From the perspective of an I.R.S. auditor, pulling in nearly $5 million in additional revenue could be considered a good day\u2019s work. For the Trumps, getting the I.R.S. to agree that Fred Trump\u2019s properties were worth only $57.1 million was a triumph.\u201cAll estate matters were handled by licensed attorneys, licensed C.P.A.s and licensed real estate appraisers who followed all laws and rules strictly,\u201d Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, said in his statement.In the end, the transfer of the Trump empire cost Fred and Mary Trump $20.5 million in gift taxes and their children $21 million in annuity payments. That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than they would have paid based on the empire\u2019s market value, The Times found.On the day the Trump children finally took ownership of Fred Trump\u2019s empire, Donald Trump\u2019s net worth instantly increased by many tens of millions of dollars. And from then on, the profits from his father\u2019s empire would flow directly to him and his siblings. The next year, 1998, Donald Trump\u2019s share amounted to today\u2019s equivalent of $9.6 million, The Times found.This sudden influx of wealth came only weeks after he had published \u201cThe Art of the Comeback.\u201d\u201cI learned a lot about myself during these hard times,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI learned about handling pressure. I was able to home in, buckle down, get back to the basics, and make things work. I worked much harder, I focused, and I got myself out of a box.\u201dOver 244 pages he did not mention that he was being handed nearly 25 percent of his father\u2019s empire.During Fred Trump\u2019s final years, dementia stole most of his memories. When family visited, there was one name he could reliably put to a face.Donald.On June 7, 1999, Fred Trump was admitted to Long Island Jewish Medical Center, not far from the house in Jamaica Estates, for treatment of pneumonia. He died there on June 25, at the age of 93.Fifteen months later, Fred Trump\u2019s executors \u2014 Donald, Maryanne and Robert \u2014 filed his estate tax return. The return, obtained by The Times, vividly illustrates the effectiveness of the tax strategies devised by the Trumps in the early 1990s.Fred Trump, one of the most prolific New York developers of his time, owned just five apartment complexes, two small strip malls and a scattering of co-ops in the city upon his death. The man who paid himself $50 million in 1990 died with just $1.9 million in the bank. He owned not a single stock, bond or Treasury bill. According to his estate tax return, his most valuable asset was a $10.3 million I.O.U. from Donald Trump, money his son appears to have borrowed the year before Fred Trump died.The bulk of Fred Trump\u2019s empire was nowhere to be found on his estate tax return. And yet Donald Trump and his siblings were not done. Recycling the legally dubious techniques they had mastered with the GRATs, they dodged tens of millions of dollars in estate taxes on the remnants of empire that Fred Trump still owned when he died, The Times found.As with the GRATs, they obtained appraisals from Mr. Von Ancken that grossly understated the actual market value of those remnants. And as with the GRATs, they aggressively discounted Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s appraisals. The result: They claimed that the five apartment complexes and two strip malls were worth $15 million. In 2004, records show, bankers would put a value of $176.2 million on the exact same properties.As with the Trump Village appraisal, the Trumps appear to have hidden key facts from the I.R.S. Tysens Park, like Trump Village, had operated for years under an affordable housing program that by law capped Fred Trump\u2019s profits. This cap drastically reduced the property\u2019s market value.Except for one thing: The Trumps had removed Tysens Park from the affordable housing program the year before Fred Trump died, The Times found. When Donald Trump and his siblings filed Fred Trump\u2019s estate tax return, there were no limits on their profits. In fact, they had already begun raising rents.As their father\u2019s executors, Donald, Maryanne and Robert were legally responsible for the accuracy of his estate tax return. They were obligated not only to give the I.R.S. a complete accounting of the value of his estate\u2019s assets, but also to disclose all the taxable gifts he made during his lifetime, including, for example, the $15.5 million Trump Palace gift to Donald Trump and the millions of dollars he gave his children via All County\u2019s padded invoices.\u201cIf they knew anything was wrong they could be in violation of tax law,\u201d Mr. Tritt, the University of Florida law professor, said. \u201cThey can\u2019t just stick their heads in the sand.\u201dIn addition to drastically understating the value of apartment complexes and shopping centers, Fred Trump\u2019s estate tax return made no mention of either Trump Palace or All County.It wasn\u2019t until after Fred Trump\u2019s wife, Mary, died at 88 on Aug. 7, 2000, that the I.R.S. completed its audit of their combined estates. The audit concluded that their estates were worth $51.8 million, 23 percent more than Donald Trump and his siblings had claimed.That meant an additional $5.2 million in estate taxes. Even so, the Trumps\u2019 tax bill was a fraction of what they would have owed had they reported the market value of what Fred and Mary Trump owned at the time of their deaths.Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, defended the tax returns filed by the Trumps. \u201cThe returns and tax positions that The Times now attacks were examined in real time by the relevant taxing authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cThe taxing authorities requested a few minor adjustments, which were made, and then fully approved all of the tax filings. These matters have now been closed for more than a decade.\u201dIn 2003, the Trump siblings gathered at Trump Tower for one of their periodic updates on their inherited empire.As always, Robert Trump drove into Manhattan with several of his lieutenants. Donald Trump appeared with Allen H. Weisselberg, who had worked for Fred Trump for two decades before becoming his son\u2019s chief financial officer. The sisters, Maryanne Trump Barry and Elizabeth Trump Grau, were there as well.The meeting followed the usual routine: a financial report, a rundown of operational issues and then the real business \u2014 distributing profits to each Trump. The task of handing out the checks fell to Steve Gurien, the empire\u2019s finance chief.A moment later, Donald Trump abruptly changed the course of his family\u2019s history: He said it was a good time to sell.Fred Trump\u2019s empire, in fact, was continuing to produce healthy profits, and selling contradicted his stated wish to keep his legacy in the family. But Donald Trump insisted that the real estate market had peaked and that the time was right, according to a person familiar with the meeting.He was also, once again, in financial trouble. His Atlantic City casinos were veering toward another bankruptcy. His creditors would soon threaten to oust him unless he committed to invest $55 million of his own money.Yet if Donald Trump\u2019s sudden push to sell stunned the room, it met with no apparent resistance from his siblings. He directed his brother to solicit private bids, saying he wanted the sale handled quickly and quietly. Donald Trump\u2019s signature skill \u2014 drumming up publicity for the Trump brand \u2014 would sit this one out.Three potential bidders were given access to the finances of Fred Trump\u2019s empire \u2014 37 apartment complexes and several shopping centers. Ruby Schron, a major New York City landlord, quickly emerged as the favorite. In December 2003, Mr. Schron called Donald Trump and they came to an agreement; Mr. Schron paid $705.6 million for most of the empire, which included paying off the Trumps\u2019 mortgages. A few remaining properties were sold to other buyers, bringing the total sales price to $737.9 million.On May 4, 2004, the Trump children spent most of the day signing away ownership of what their father had doggedly built over 70 years. The sale received little news coverage, and an article in The Staten Island Advance included the rarest of phrases: \u201cTrump did not return a phone call seeking comment.\u201dEven more extraordinary was this unreported fact: The banks financing Mr. Schron\u2019s purchase valued Fred Trump\u2019s empire at nearly $1 billion. In other words, Donald Trump, master dealmaker, sold his father\u2019s empire for hundreds of millions less than it was worth.Within a year of the sale, Mr. Trump spent $149 million in cash on a rapid series of transactions that bolstered his billionaire bona fides. In June 2004 he agreed to pay $73 million to buy out his partner in the planned Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago. (\u201cI\u2019m just buying it with my own cash,\u201d he told reporters.) He paid $55 million in cash to make peace with his casino creditors. Then he put up $21 million more in cash to help finance his purchase of Maison de l\u2019Amiti\u00e9, a waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., that he later sold to a Russian oligarch.*****The first season of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was broadcast in 2004, just as Donald Trump was wrapping up the sale of his father\u2019s empire. The show\u2019s opening montage \u2014 quick cuts of a glittering Trump casino, then Trump Tower, then a Trump helicopter mid-flight, then a limousine depositing the man himself at the steps of his jet, all set to the song \u201cFor the Love of Money\u201d \u2014 is a reminder that the story of Donald Trump is fundamentally a story of money.Money is at the core of the brand Mr. Trump has so successfully sold to the world. Yet essential to that mythmaking has been keeping the truth of his money \u2014 how much of it he actually has, where and whom it came from \u2014 hidden or obscured. Across the decades, aided and abetted by less-than-aggressive journalism, Mr. Trump has made sure his financial history would be sensationalized far more than seen.In a statement to The Times, the president\u2019s spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, reiterated what Mr. Trump has always claimed about the evolution of his fortune: \u201cThe president\u2019s father gave him an initial $1 million loan, which he paid back. President Trump used this money to build an incredibly successful company as well as net worth of over $10 billion, including owning some of the world\u2019s greatest real estate.\u201dBut the more than 100,000 pages of records obtained during this investigation make it possible to sweep away decades of misinformation and arrive at a clear understanding about the original source of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth \u2014 his father.Here is what can be said with certainty: Had Mr. Trump done nothing but invest the money his father gave him in an index fund that tracks the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, he would be worth $1.96 billion today. As for that $1 million loan, Fred Trump actually lent him at least $60.7 million, or $140 million in today\u2019s dollars, The Times found.And there is one more Fred Trump windfall coming Donald Trump\u2019s way. Starrett City, the Brooklyn housing complex that the Trumps invested in back in the 1970s, sold this year for $905 million. Donald Trump\u2019s share of the proceeds is expected to exceed $16 million, records show.It was an investment made with Fred Trump\u2019s money and connections. But in Donald Trump\u2019s version of his life, Starrett City is always and forever \u201cone of the best investments I ever made.\u201dPhoto illustration by Grant Gold/The New York Times.

{"Headline": "Income Investors Finally Have a Chance to Cash In", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the first time since the financial crisis, playing it safe is paying off for income investors.After a decade when conservative money market funds and similar short-term investments yielded close to zero, it is now possible to earn about 2 percent and even a bit more.Lately, pocketing a 2 percent to 3 percent return owning cash is better than the performance of popular core bond funds that track the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.That\u2019s because bond fund returns have two components: the interest paid by the bonds and changes in bond prices. When interest rates rise, prices fall. A bond statistic called duration estimates a portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to rate changes; the longer a portfolio\u2019s duration, the bigger its price loss when rates rise.Core bond funds that track the aggregate index have a duration of around six years, considered intermediate-term in bond parlance. That means when interest rates rise one percentage point, the index\u2019s bond prices will fall 6 percent. Over the past year, rising interest rates lifted the yield on core bond funds above 3 percent, but that was not enough income to offset price declines.Morningstar Direct reports that ultrashort-term bond funds \u2014 portfolios with durations below one year \u2014 have had the highest net inflows among all types of taxable bond funds for six consecutive months through August.\u201cImplicitly, that is trying to time the market,\u201d Ms. Jones said, and such behavior can hurt investor returns.For example, in the 12 months through February 2009 \u2014 the heart of the last stock meltdown \u2014 intermediate-term bonds rallied 5 percent and Treasury bills gained 1.3 percent.Moreover, if you\u2019re worried about a bond bear market, it\u2019s time to check your rearview mirror.With inflation still in check, expectations are that longer-term interest rates may already be near a peak. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen to 3.1 percent recently from 1.4 percent in July 2016.That means you and your core bond fund have probably already lived through what passes for a bond bear market in this economic cycle. The aggregate index has lost a grand total of less than two percentage points since July 2016.If your current fixed-income strategy is simply to own a core bond fund that tracks the aggregate index, you can reduce the duration by adding shorter-term mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, or even cash.Shifting some money out of a core bond fund can also be an opportunity to add diversification in securities that are not included in the index.With the same outlook for the economy, Mr. Fredericks said he had placed nearly 30 percent of the BlackRock Multi-Asset Income fund\u2019s assets in high-yield corporate bonds and floating rate loans, which are usually high-yield issues. That said, BlackRock is being careful, he said. \u201cOur focus is on higher-quality high yield. Even if we find ourselves in recession, those companies are better positioned to weather it,\u201d he said.The resurrection of short-term yields merits two more portfolio considerations.Once you\u2019ve got your tweaking done, you might relax. \u201cThe whole idea of fixed income is you don\u2019t have to worry about it if you have it invested properly,\u201d Ms. Jones said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trump Bump in Stocks Is Weakening", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the stock market keeps dropping, President Trump could lose one of his favorite bragging rights.Concerns about higher interest rates, Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies and slower economic growth outside the United States have weighed heavily on stocks this month. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 5 percent in October and sits 5.6 percent below its record high in September.Still the stock market remains up a lot since Election Day in 2016, something Mr. Trump has often trumpeted. And with the economy solid and unemployment low, the recent volatility in the stock market is unlikely to have much effect on the midterm elections next month.But the stock market is one of the most prominent indicators of confidence, and recent weakness suggests investors have some doubts about Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership. If the S. & P. 500 falls further, Mr. Trump will struggle to compare himself favorably with other presidents. Here\u2019s how he compares with his predecessors in the nearly two-year period after they were each elected.The S. & P. 500 is up 29.4 percent in the 710 days since Nov. 8, 2016. Over the same number of days after Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012, the benchmark posted a gain of 32.1 percent.The performance of stocks under Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama fall far short of the rally that took place after Bill Clinton was re-elected in 1996. The S. & P. 500 soared 48 percent over the equivalent period.It\u2019s fun to debate how much credit presidents deserve for strong stock market performance, but it\u2019s hard to know for sure. Investors take cues primarily from corporate earnings, forecasts of economic growth and whether stocks are expensive or cheap. Presidents typically have little direct influence over any of those. It\u2019s hard, for instance, to tie Mr. Clinton\u2019s policies to the innovation in the technology sector that helped stocks soar during his second term.With Mr. Trump, there is some clear causality. The tax cuts that he enacted last year have lifted corporate earnings, which helped push the S. & P. 500 higher.The rally since 2016 also stands out because it started when stocks were already quite highly valued. The price-to-earnings ratio of the S. & P. 500, which compares stock prices with the earnings of companies in the index, was 14 when Mr. Obama was re-elected. When Mr. Trump won, it was 18.But some of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies seem to have weighed on stocks and could continue to do so. His tax cuts that bolstered profits are causing the budget deficit to balloon, which is a growing source of concern among investors. The trade frictions that he has created have hurt the earnings of some companies. And if Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on China weigh on that country\u2019s economy, the effects could be felt around the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Uber and Lyft Charge Toward Potential I.P.O.s Next Year", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUber and Lyft have for years battled for customers in the fast-growing ride-hailing business. Now the bitter rivals may fight for investors in their initial public offerings.Uber has received proposals from the investment banks Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs that say the technology giant could be worth as much as $120 billion in an I.P.O., two people briefed on the matter who were not allowed to discuss it publicly said on Tuesday.At $120 billion, Uber\u2019s debut on Wall Street would be the biggest since the Alibaba Group of China began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014.The market for tech I.P.O.s has surged in 2018. Nearly 200 companies have raised more than $53 billion in initial public offerings in American markets, making it the busiest year for tech newcomers to Wall Street since 2014, according to data from Dealogic.But a blockbuster public offering for Uber, which has burned through billions of dollars since it was founded in 2009 and does not appear to be close to sustained profitability, would mark a significant increase in risk-taking for investors in publicly traded companies.The banks also suggested that Uber could list its shares for trading on the stock market earlier than its original plans for late 2019. That would put pressure on the company\u2019s main rival in the United States, Lyft, which recently picked JPMorgan Chase to lead its own initial public offering, said two other people briefed on the matter who were not allowed to speak about it publicly.This year, Lyft\u2019s latest fund-raising round valued the company at $15 billion. It had been planning to go public in the spring, putting distance between its I.P.O. and Uber\u2019s.Now the companies could find themselves in a race to the public markets, courting investors eager for a piece of two prominent tech industry darlings. The company that goes first is expected to have an advantage and could demand a higher price for its shares.\u201cThe first ride-sharing I.P.O. will get a lot of attention, so I think there\u2019s some marketing value to being the first one out of the gate,\u201d said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, which provides research and manages funds.Uber\u2019s I.P.O. is likely to be among the biggest financial events on Wall Street next year. At $120 billion, it would rival the total value of Facebook when it went public in 2012 with a market capitalization of $104 billion, Ms. Smith said.As a privately held company, Uber is not required to publicly disclose its quarterly results. But for some time it has revealed basic financial information to give investors a better sense of its health.At the time, Uber was struggling to overcome a range of management issues, and the SoftBank investment was a steep discount from earlier rounds, which priced the company as high as $70 billion.A $500 million investment made by Toyota in August valued Uber at $76 billion.The San Francisco company is aggressively trying to increase business for UberEats, its food delivery business, and is expanding into rentals of electric bikes and scooters, as well as bookings for freight shipments.Lyft said revenue for 2017 was $1 billion \u2014 a 168 percent increase from the year before \u2014 but did not disclose its profits or losses for the year. Financial analysts assume Lyft, like Uber, has burned through significant amounts of cash.Uber and Lyft are both working on autonomous vehicles. Executives believe that driverless cars could eliminate one of their biggest expenses \u2014 human drivers. But the technology is, for the moment, prohibitively expensive and far from wide commercial use.A lack of profits is unlikely to scare off investors. Much as it did during the dot-com boom nearly 20 years ago, Wall Street is cozying up to tech companies that are growing fast but burning through cash.\u201cI think investors are going to be comfortable with Uber,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cThe issue is going to be at what price.\u201dMatt Phillips contributed reporting in New York.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Legal Cannabis Experiment Begins: The Canada Letter", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s probably not a coincidence that the first day of legal recreational marijuana sales landed on a weekday. Canada\u2019s big new social and legal step was met by midnight crowds at marijuana shops in St. John\u2019s, a concert in Halifax (where security guards told partygoers to put out celebratory joints) and a countdown party in Toronto. But for most Canadians, today is another workday rather than a time for getting high and partying.Still, this is a moment when much of the world is watching Canada. I began this morning being interviewed by broadcasters in the United States and Britain. What some are calling Canada\u2019s great experiment may, if it unfolds successfully, serve as a template for other countries. If Canada stumbles, legalization will become a cautionary tale.This week, we began to explore the social, economic and legal consequences of the government\u2019s plan, which we\u2019ve compiled in this bonus issue of the Canada Letter.Dan Bilefsky is leading our news coverage today from Montreal where, among other things, he\u2019s visiting provincially owned pot shops. Dan, along with the Canada bureau chief, Catherine Porter, and I, will continue updating the story.While Canada is the first major industrial nation to take on this challenge, several states in the United States have already legalized marijuana, though it remains prohibited under federal law. Thomas Fuller, the San Francisco bureau chief for The Times, found that after 10 months of legalization in California, the black market still rules.Like many things in Canada, what legal marijuana actually entails will vary depending on where you live. Montrealers can now peruse the offerings at cannabis shops run by Quebec\u2019s liquor board. But the only legal option for people in Ontario is online shopping.That\u2019s not the only thing that will differ, province to province. The list includes legal age, whether you can grow legal marijuana at home, and where you can actually smoke it. We\u2019ve put together a guide to help you sort out the new rules.The government has said that one of its goals for the heavily regulated system is to put the brakes on the growth in marijuana use by Canadians, and to keep it away from children. We are, by global standards, something of a land of potheads. Catherine made her way through the haze of the underground scene to get a sense of how cannabis culture will change with legalization.Mixed in with celebration, there\u2019s consternation among some previously illicit users.\u201cSome people are referring to this as Prohibition 2.0,\u201d a sociologist who studies cannabis users told Catherine. \u201cThe regulation has brought an enhanced sense of scrutiny.\u201dSince Canada\u2019s medical marijuana industry was greatly expanded in 2013, I\u2019ve been writing about the people who hope to cash in on marijuana. Back then, major banks wouldn\u2019t deal with many of their companies and several of them seemed perpetually on the brink of bankruptcy.The transformation has been dizzying. The largest producers are now valued by investors in the billions. Executives who were once scraping by now drive around in Ferraris. Many of their employees, thanks to stock options, are now millionaires. And some of the communities where they are based, notably Smiths Falls, Ontario, are experiencing an economic revival.But like the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, there\u2019s unease over how real the current paper wealth of the marijuana industry will ultimately prove to be.An earlier version of this article included two photo captions that incorrectly identified a marijuana facility in Vancouver.

{"Headline": "Why Has the Stock Market Been Dropping? The Expansion Heads Toward a New Phase", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a less bullish time for investors, but mostly good for workers and the economy. The bull market that will turn 10 years old early next year has, for most of its run, been a total dream for stock investors.Economic growth in the United States has been steady, but growth worldwide has been slow \u2014 which has kept interest rates low, making stocks a more compelling investment than cash or bonds in comparison.Late in this bull market, the Trump administration made its signature domestic policy initiative a steep cut in corporate tax rates, which flows through directly into higher after-tax profits for shareholders.Those three factors together were enough to propel the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 up more than 300 percent from its March 2009 low to its recent high in September. But now, all three are shifting.The economy is now heating up enough that interest rates are rising to more normal levels. Part of that is a result of Federal Reserve rate increases aimed at preventing the economy from overheating and from having excess inflation break out, a policy that President Trump has attacked.But it\u2019s not just the Fed. Even longer-term interest rates that the Fed does not directly control have risen substantially in the last year, as have longer-term rates in other countries. British, German and Japanese bond yields are all up over the same span.If you look at the stock market only in terms of its valuation \u2014 how much you have to spend to buy shares for each dollar of corporate earnings you are capturing \u2014 the stock market drop in recent weeks can be explained in significant part by the rise in longer-term rates in the same period.If you look at the price-earnings ratio of the S.&P. 500 stocks, for example, and invert it to view it as the earnings-to-price ratio, it was 4.77 percent on Sept 1, meaning buying $100 bought you $4.77 worth of corporate profits. After the stock drop, that had risen to 5.23 percent.Higher interest rates have made bonds more attractive, and it makes perfect sense that investors would demand a more favorable valuation from stocks given that alternative.The story might be different if investors believed that higher growth would feed disproportionately into higher corporate profits. But the current economic moment offers plenty of reason to think it won\u2019t.Earlier in the expansion, there might have been lots of workers on the sidelines, and companies had leverage with their suppliers. But there are signs that is changing, like recent comments by 3M and Caterpillar that their input costs were rising, which helped kick off the recent bout of market weakness.This is bad news for stocks and for the bottom lines of the largest companies, but good news for American workers. When you hear a phrase on a corporate call like \u201cinput costs are rising,\u201d keep in mind that the wages you receive are one of those costs.So far, the scale of the tariffs hasn\u2019t been big enough to have much impact on overall economic growth. But there has been a direct bottom-line impact for particular blue-chip companies that make goods using steel or aluminum (prices of which have spiked because of tariffs) or that import key parts from China.As companies try to reroute supply chains or absorb higher costs to avoid raising prices on consumers, the trade war may have a much larger effect on the bottom lines of major industrial companies, and hence on their stock prices, than it does for ordinary consumers.Put it together, and the stock market tumble of the last few weeks is not a mystery to be solved, nor a warning of horrible things to come, so much as an inevitable result of the economic expansion reaching a more mature stage.The stock market looks forward, not back \u2014 share prices are determined by what investors think the future looks like. And the economic future is starting to look quite different from the past.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.P.O. Procrastinators Might Now Face a Long Wait", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsRising interest rates, trade war tensions and the threat of Brexit may mean that some I.P.O. procrastinators have missed their chance.The Spanish oil group Cepsa on Monday became the latest market hopeful to put its stock market debut on hold. It joined the Dutch car-leasing company LeasePlan, which was seeking a 7.5 billion euro (about $8.8 billion) price tag according to Bloomberg, but last week said it would not proceed \u201cdue to market conditions.\u201d The Chinese streaming service Tencent Music Entertainment has also paused plans to raise $2 billion in a U.S. listing until equity markets stabilized, Reuters reported.Blaming the markets is far from a catchall excuse, though. The German brake maker Knorr Bremse last week raised 3.9 billion euros with an offering priced in the middle of its expected range, and the shares are up slightly since. And shares in Shurgard, a self-storage group that priced its Brussels I.P.O. near the bottom of the range, rose about 5 percent on its first hours of trading on Monday. The lesson is that, even in turbulent times, investors will support modestly-priced companies with business models that are easy to understand.Prospective shareholders will use a bigger magnifying glass when examining harder-to-value prospects. While Tencent Music has a listed peer in Spotify, its strategy for getting listeners to pay for music in piracy-heavy China is unclear. LeasePlan struggled to reassure investors who worried that corporate clients would slash company car spending in the next recession. And Mubadala, an Abu Dhabi state investor that owns Cepsa, was seeking proceeds of 2 billion euros at a valuation premium to Spanish rival Repsol, based on Breakingviews calculations.The trio may have missed the boat for a while. Europe\u2019s Stoxx 50 stock index has not yet recovered from a worldwide rout on Oct. 10. So long as the Federal Reserve keeps tightening monetary policy, higher bond yields are probably here to stay. Add United States-China trade tensions and the fallout from a possible no-deal Brexit next year, and it\u2019s hard to imagine investors taking a chance on risky I.P.O.s for some time.Advertisement"}

But the power of BlackRock could help this approach catch on. Today alone, the firm unveiled seven new ESG funds in the U.S. and Europe.And the firm has grand ambitions. Mark Wiedman, the head of its iShares unit, told the FT: \u201cOne day we\u2019ll drop \u2018sustainable\u2019 because this lineup will just be the core of all great portfolios.\u201dLooser regulations on banks may help usher in the next financial crisis, he says.

That\u2019s not surprising: Lawmakers are still in the early stages of figuring out what new privacy rules should look like, so industry groups are doing what they can now to shape their thinking.The U.S. labor market is in its best shape in decades, with unemployment averaging about 4 percent this year. But wage growth has stagnated, puzzling economists.\u2022 More slack in the labor market could mean that the economy can support more work than is actually being created.\u2022 A slowdown in productivity gains, so that the value of what workers produce is growing more slowly than in the past.\u2022 Rising inequality, which could reduce upward mobility and weaken the bargaining power of unions to negotiate raises.Mr. Tedeschi\u2019s conclusion: \u201cAlthough the unemployment rate may look the way it did in boom times in 2000, for many Americans, wage growth has much further to go.\u201dThe Trump administration wants NASA to focus on ambitious challenges like sending astronauts to Mars. Some of the money to make that happen is supposed to come from handing off parts of space exploration to the private sector. The federal government, for instance, plans to cut direct financing of the International Space Station after 2024.Companies like Bigelow are years from launching their space stations, and such expensive, cutting-edge projects often slip behind schedule. Critics worry that the International Space Station might be discarded before its successors are ready. A gap without space stations would disrupt NASA\u2019s studies, as well as emerging commercial endeavors.

For #MeToo, this may just be the beginning.The sight of Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s top Washington official, sitting behind his friend Brett Kavanaugh at last week\u2019s Senate nomination hearing angered many at the social network. They saw it as a kind of an endorsement from the company.This week, Facebook employees kept flooding internal forums with comments about Mr. Kaplan\u2019s appearance at the hearing. In a post on Wednesday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive, appeared to dismiss the concerns when he wrote to employees that \u201cit is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.\u201d Facebook plans to hold another staff meeting on Friday to contain the damage, said the current and former employees.After the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the country, the E.U. \u2014 still in the pact \u2014 began trying to shield its companies from the financial penalties. There\u2019s more at stake than one agreement.What the Europeans devised is a \u201cspecial payments entity\u201d to let companies move money in and out of Tehran when Western banks won\u2019t. While big multinationals have already withdrawn from Iran, others haven\u2019t \u2014 and Europeans hope that continued trade will keep the nuclear deal alive. (American officials threatened to crack down on any such move.)The danger for the United States is that the payments mechanism gives the European Union valuable experience operating outside Washington\u2019s financial sphere of influence and becomes a permanent part of the international payments system.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "The Gloom Encroaching on Trump\u2019s Stock Boom", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe good times President Trump brought to the stock market may be ending.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down nearly 7 percent from its peak in late September, and the Nasdaq index, which includes many hot technology stocks, has fallen nearly 10 percent from its high.Doubts appear to be overwhelming investors\u2019 bullishness. They are concerned that Mr. Trump\u2019s bellicose trade policy will disrupt corporate America\u2019s supply chains and push up costs. Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts have contributed to a ballooning fiscal deficit. Borrowing costs have also risen this year, which could dampen investment.\u201cDonald Trump has made uncertainty great again,\u201d said David Rosenberg, chief economist of Gluskin Sheff. \u201cHis policies are doing more harm than good.\u201dThe market reaction is a stark reversal. Investors had piled into stocks with abandon for much of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Taxes and regulations were being slashed, earnings were surging and the United States economy was performing better than many of its rivals. The S.&P. 500 is up 28 percent since Election Day 2016.Crucially, to investors, it is not clear when the threats to the stock market will lift. But until they do, stocks could remain weak.The market plunge does not seem to fit with the strong economic data. Unemployment is at a multi-decade low, the economy grew at a 4.2 percent clip last quarter and corporate earnings, the biggest driver of stock prices, are expected to rise more than 20 percent this year.But this good news, according to some analysts, had caused investors to underestimate a number of concerns.\u201cThere was this great sense of complacency,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.This could be seen in the stock market\u2019s stretched valuations. Earlier this year, the S.&.P 500\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio, a yardstick that compares stock prices to past earnings, hit its highest level in over 15 years. But investors kept buying stocks in the expectation that the strong earnings growth would continue. Much of the growth this year came from the tax cuts enacted at the end of 2017. As a result, investors expect slower earnings growth in 2019.Not even Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-edge trade policies could shake investor faith in stocks. After the Trump administration forged a trade truce with the European Union over the summer, Wall Street seemed to grow comfortable with the trade war, and stocks resumed their climb.But in recent weeks, investors became newly worried about the trade tensions with China, which the United States has targeted with tariffs on $250 billion of its goods. The battle could now have an outsize effect on the stock market. Technology companies, whose stocks have risen strongly, may be among those most harmed. The tariffs along with China\u2019s retaliatory measures make it harder for them to operate and expand their finely honed supply chains.Investors have also grown concerned about the Federal Reserve. For much of the year, they seemed to believe that the central bank would continue to gradually raise interest rates without significantly slowing the economy and disrupting financial markets. But with a strong United States economy, it\u2019s not clear when the Fed will stop raising interest rates.The growing fiscal deficit illustrates how investors suddenly had to grapple with the flip side of a policy \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts \u2014 that they had favored. The lower taxes immediately bolstered companies\u2019 bottom lines, but the federal government\u2019s revenues fell short, forcing the government to sell more debt. The interest payments on Treasury securities are now higher than they were during the Great Recession.In any sell-off, it\u2019s important to keep things in perspective. Even after the past week\u2019s drop, the S.&P. 500 is still up 2 percent this year. Retail investors appear to be well ahead. Households\u2019 holdings of mutual funds have risen by $1.9 trillion since the third quarter of 2016, according to figures from the Federal Reserve.Long-term rallies in stocks are often punctuated with corrections, or declines of 10 percent or more from their most recent high. If another occurred this year, the S.&P. 500 would be down only 1 percent this year. Investors can most likely stomach that. The Fed can always choose to hold off on raising interest rates.Larry Kudlow, President Trump\u2019s economic adviser, on Thursday sought to calm nerves. \u201cIf you have a strong economy, that will provide confidence for stocks, but corrections come and go,\u201d he told CNBC.The big question now is whether the stock market rout is a signal that the economy is set to slow markedly. Analysts are looking at trading patterns to determine whether that is the case. They note that so-called defensive stocks, like utilities, have outperformed companies in other sectors.Bank stocks, which usually do well when the Fed raises interest rates gently, have lagged the wider market for months. Investors may be betting that banks will have less business because the economy is about to slow. A handful of large banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, are scheduled to report third-quarter earnings early Friday.Mr. Paulsen predicts that the economy\u2019s growth rate will fall back toward 2 percent. \u201cIf it does, how will Trump act?\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated in one instance the surname of the analyst who predicted that growth would slow to 2 percent.

{"Headline": "Is a Slowdown in Bank Lending a Bad Sign for the Economy?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySomething is afoot in the world of banking that suggests the economy is not as strong as it looks.Four of the United States\u2019 largest banks on Friday reported third-quarter results that, for the most part, exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations.But a worrisome trend again showed up in their numbers: The banks were not lending at the same rate that they had in recent years. While the economy can grow without strong lending, it may struggle to maintain its strength if loan growth remains lackluster.In the third quarter, the combined loans of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial Services increased just 2 percent from a year earlier, in line with the second-quarter rate. Last year, loans at the four banks grew 2.9 percent, and in 2016 and 2015 the rate was well above 4 percent.Though third-quarter loan growth was subpar, the tax cuts enacted at the end of last year continued to lift bank profits, and rising interest rates are helping banks earn more on their loans. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings surged 24 percent. Wells Fargo, still under regulatory scrutiny after a series of scandals, posted a 32 percent rise in net income, helped, in part, by a decline in costs. Citigroup\u2019s profits were up 12 percent.Earnings at PNC were solidly higher, but its sluggish lending helped send its stock down over 5 percent on Friday. In the third quarter, its loans grew only 0.9 percent, and the banks said growth would be modest in the fourth quarter.It\u2019s probably too early to get alarmed about the slowdown in lending.One of the reasons growth has decelerated should not be a source of concern. Companies, enjoying stronger revenues and lower taxes, have less need to borrow and roll over existing debt when it comes due. William S. Demchak, chief executive of PNC, said Friday that borrowers were paying down their loans more than expected.Another reason for the lower growth is sensible. Bank executives said they saw signs of the economy overheating and were holding back. At Wells Fargo, loans fell 1 percent in the third quarter. Loans to finance the purchase or construction of buildings used by businesses drove the decline. John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief financial officer, said Friday that the bank had stayed cautious in lending to the sector out of a desire to maintain \u201ccredit discipline.\u201dStill, the weak lending growth could be a sign that the economy is losing momentum.Take mortgages: Rising interest rates are pushing up the cost of mortgages at the same time housing prices in many parts of the country remain elevated. As a result, demand for mortgages has lessened. Wells Fargo\u2019s mortgage applications in the third quarter were lower than in the preceding four quarters.Some companies may be less willing to borrow because their executives are starting to get nervous that President Trump\u2019s trade policies and other geopolitical developments could weigh on global growth. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, sounded a warning about global uncertainties in a statement accompanying the bank\u2019s third-quarter earnings report. JPMorgan\u2019s loan growth, at 4.4 percent, was the strongest of the four banks that reported, but it was still well below the rates it posted in 2016 and 2015.Notably, there are signs outside of the banks\u2019 balance sheets of a weakening in credit growth. Companies borrow in the bond markets, and many loans also end up in special financial entities called collateralized loan obligations. But corporate bond issues were down 15.6 percent this year through September, compared with the same period last year, according to data from Sifma, a financial industry trade group. Debt issued by collateralized loan and debt obligations was down by 47 percent, according to Sifma.Then there is the message that bank stocks are sending. Even with the economy doing well, interest rates rising and the Trump administration\u2019s promises of deregulation, shares in banks have lagged the broader market for months. It\u2019s a sign that investors are not particularly excited about the growth prospects for the core businesses of banking, like lending and trading. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is up 3.5 percent this year. Bank stocks, measured using the KBW Nasdaq Bank index, is down 5.9 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Interest Rates Are Rising for All the Right Reasons", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what the bond market is really telling us about the economic future.The cost to borrow money is on the rise. That is bad news for home buyers and other prospective borrowers. It helped cause a stock market sell-off on Wednesday and Thursday, and prompted President Trump to say that the Federal Reserve has \u201cgone crazy.\u201dBut it amounts to good news for the long-term direction of the economy.In effect, the multi-trillion dollar global bond market is signaling a little greater confidence than it did just a few weeks ago that the nine-year expansion in the United States may have room to keep going for years to come, and without inflation taking off.But beyond those headline numbers, the details of how the prices of different types of securities have moved relative to one another tell a story that is decidedly optimistic.For much of the last couple of years, short-term interest rates, which the Fed controls directly, have risen much faster than longer-term rates, which are set based on global supply and demand for bonds. The Fed was plowing ahead with rate increases, while investors were evidently skeptical that growth would be persistent enough to justify higher long-term rates.Since then, longer-term rates have risen faster than shorter-term ones. While the yield curve remains flat by historical standards (the gap between 10-year and two-year bonds was up to only 0.33 percent in recent days), it has moved in a direction consistent with a more optimistic outlook.\u201cThe long end of the yield curve has finally moved to the view that this could be a more persistent recovery,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. \u201cIt\u2019s reflecting the possibility that this recovery has further legs.\u201dBut, crucially, the higher long-term interest rates don\u2019t seem to be driven by expectations that inflation will soar higher.The yields of inflation-protected bonds have moved mostly in lock step with traditional bonds in recent weeks, suggesting that traders haven\u2019t become more worried about inflation.In previous years, financial markets have been doubtful that the Fed would follow through with its forecasts for rate increases. Now the Fed\u2019s own projections are consistent with the path of rate increases priced into markets.\u201cThe market seems to have accepted the Fed\u2019s rate path,\u201d said Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management.Moreover, Roberto Perli of Cornerstone Macro calculates that a big part of the higher rates is an increase in the \u201cterm premium.\u201d That means investors are demanding more compensation than they did a few weeks ago for tying their money up for many years. This implies they now see a greater possibility that growth and short-term interest rates could surprise by rising faster than forecasters now project.\u201cThe markets are bringing up their expectations for growth, and have been bringing them up all year,\u201d Mr. Perli said. \u201cThe trend is clearly up, and the market is betting that will continue.\u201dOf course, there are downsides to the higher rates. The recent stock market volatility has been fueled in part by the realization that higher rates will mean higher borrowing costs for corporations.The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.9 percent, from below 4 percent at the end of 2017, according to data from Freddie Mac.\u201cWe are getting into that zone where the typical mortgage payment is increasing much faster than incomes, and that\u2019s going to put a brake on some markets,\u201d said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist at the real estate site Zillow.In effect, higher mortgage rates could depress the rate of price appreciation of houses, as home buyers cannot bid as aggressively for properties as they could when rates were lower.And markets, even deep and liquid ones like the bond market, aren\u2019t always right, and are frequently wrong. No one would argue that the details of the yield curve, for example, offer some unassailable prediction of the future.But for all the stock market palpitations and risks to particular interest-rate sensitive industries, the message to take from the recent rise in interest rates is an unambiguously good one: This expansion may have some life in it yet.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Global Stock Markets Show Mixed Results Day After Big Drop on Wall St.", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConcerns over China\u2019s economy continue to weigh on investors.Concerns over China's economy have dragged on stocks this month. China\u2019s currency, the yuan, hit a 21-month low, amid the tariff fight between China and the United States, the world\u2019s largest economies. \u201cPerceptions in markets are evolving, and more people are nervous that this is going to be a long, drawn-out affair,\u201d said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, a trade group and research provider. China\u2019s government on Friday reported that the economy grew by 6.5 percent over the three months that ended in September compared with a year ago. But growing concerns about the health of its economy, along with rising interest rates that could slow the American economy, have made investors jumpy and worried that a near-perfect investing environment \u2014 low inflation, strong growth and relatively low interest rates \u2014 is becoming tougher to navigate. Here\u2019s a briefing on what has been happening in the stock market. Investors are concerned that rising borrowing costs could crimp domestic growth. Small stocks, which are particularly susceptible to higher borrowing costs, fell 1.8 percent. And other interest-rate sensitive areas of the stock market have been beaten up in recent weeks. The S.&P. home-building index is down 10 percent this month, as mortgage rates have pushed above 5 percent. We\u2019re in the middle of earnings season \u2014 and results from companies could help assuage the worst concerns. On the whole, results should be good. When they\u2019re tallied in a few weeks, profits for S.&P. 500 companies are expected to be up more than 20 percent, compared with last year. That\u2019s largely thanks to strong economic growth in the United States and deep corporate tax cuts. But on Thursday, investors seemed to find gloom even in good earnings news. United Rentals \u2014 a company that rents out construction and industrial equipment \u2014 tumbled 15 percent after reporting earnings that were better than expected. Investors did not like the look of softer-than-expected rental price growth, which can be a leading indicator of a slowdown in the highly cyclical rental industry. \u201cInvestors look at slowing rate growth and say, \u2018Well that\u2019s a negative signal,\u2019\u201d said Steven Fisher, who covers United Rentals as an equity analyst at UBS.

But that expenditure actually fell as a percentage of the overall (and rapidly growing) economy.Corporate tax revenues have fallen by a third from a comparable period a year ago, a direct consequence of the tax law signed last year, which reduced the top corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.For the full 2018 fiscal year, corporate tax receipts were nearly $205 billion. That figure is a drop from $297 billion in fiscal year 2017.And because the tax law change didn\u2019t take effect until January, its full effect won\u2019t be known until the 2019 fiscal year.At a conference yesterday celebrating Wired magazine\u2019s 25th anniversary, two of the biggest names in tech addressed some of their divisive business strategies:More from Paul Mozur of the NYT:The military exploited Facebook\u2019s wide reach in Myanmar, where it is so broadly used that many of the country\u2019s 18 million internet users confuse the Silicon Valley social media platform with the internet. Human rights groups blame the anti-Rohingya propaganda for inciting murders, rapes and the largest forced human migration in recent history.Facebook has since removed accounts with a total of 1.3 million followers that supposedly focused on entertainment, but that instead appeared tied to the military.This is the latest in a series of disinformation campaigns \u2014 including from Russia and Iran \u2014 to plague Facebook. But as Mr. Mozur points out, it is \u201camong the first examples of an authoritarian government\u2019s using the social network against its own people.\u201dThe Microsoft co-founder, who helped popularize personal computing with Bill Gates and later used his wealth to transform Seattle, died yesterday. The cause was complications of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which returned years after he had been treated for it.Mr. Allen was instrumental in putting together a deal to buy an early operating system from a programmer in Seattle. He and Mr. Gates tweaked and massaged the code, and it became the operating system that guided the IBM personal computer, introduced in 1981. That product, called Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS, was a watershed for the company. Later would come Microsoft\u2019s immensely popular Windows operating system, designed to be used with a computer mouse and onscreen icons.In a statement, Mr. Gates said that he was \u201cheartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends,\u201d adding that \u201cpersonal computing would not have existed without him.\u201dMr. Icahn said in a letter yesterday that he owns 8.3 percent of a special Dell stock that tracks the company\u2019s holdings in the publicly traded company VMware.

When I was getting out of grad school at the University of Chicago in 1969, I applied for six different jobs in six different finance fields. I was not dedicated to any one, but I had had a summer job at Citibank. I liked the people. I liked what I did. And so I went to Citibank in the equity research department.That was nearly 50 years ago. Do you still like your work?Every day is different, and every investment is different. The variability of investing makes it an interesting intellectual challenge. That\u2019s incredibly enjoyable.You say that investors need to be counterintuitive, and that everything that\u2019s obvious is wrong. What do you mean?Here\u2019s an example.Superior investing is taking advantage of the errors of others. In order to get an above-average return in the long run, you have to buy things for less than they\u2019re worth, which is to say that the other people out there have to be selling that thing for less than its worth.They\u2019re making a mistake and you need to act in a contrarian way to take advantage of that.Do most people understand when to buy or sell? Most people think the goal is to buy good things and sell bad things. How many people understand that there is no asset that is so good that it can\u2019t become overpriced and lethal? And there are few assets that are so bad that they can\u2019t become cheap enough to become compellingly attractive?Your firm, Oaktree, specializes in global alternative investments. Why? If you look at assets that everybody knows about, understands and is objective toward, then it\u2019s less likely you\u2019re going to find mispricings. If you\u2019re going to find bargains or overpricings to short, then it has to be in things that are not understood, known and appreciated.Why write about market cycles? One of the best ways to have a handle on macrorisk, marketwide risk, is by understanding where we stand in a cycle. When the market is high in its cycle, it\u2019s probably pretty risky. When it\u2019s low, most of the time, it turns out that they were giving away money, if only you could figure that out at the time.You say you are not an emotional person, which helps you in a market where others are very emotional. Can others learn how to do that?If you understand the role of emotion, you probably can teach yourself to be less emotional.But can the emotional person become an unemotional person through intention? I would be somewhat skeptical.I think it\u2019s easier if you\u2019re born unemotional.Well, that lets me out. It also explains why I\u2019m in the index funds. And there\u2019s another reason: I can\u2019t outthink people like you. But that\u2019s the point. You remember what Dirty Harry said? \u201cA man\u2019s got to know his limitations.\u201dI don\u2019t write to make investing easy. I write to show how hard it is so that people won\u2019t try tricks that they can\u2019t do. You know what they say, don\u2019t try this at home, right?Why do you believe in market timing?I believe it is highly possible to improve your long-term results by adjusting your investment position at the extremes of the cycle. Not that often. But at the extremes.And by the way, I think that it works fairly dependably at the extremes, but it does not work at all dependably otherwise.So that means you shouldn\u2019t trade a lot?Unless the situation is compelling, trading doesn\u2019t make sense. Waiting patiently is an essential part of being an investor. And when you do take action, do it dynamically, forcefully.If you do a little trading all the time it is going to be a disaster. I always wondered what would happen if we set up a trading room so that it only accepted orders on Thursdays. And in between, all people could do is think. Maybe you would do better.A good percentage of the money we manage here is 10-year money. You put your money in and you can\u2019t get it out for 10 years.I believe denying clients the ability to be hyper- traders is doing them a favor. Most people are not adept enough to take advantage of short-term mis-valuations, and I put myself in that category.Have investors become smarter in the 50 years you\u2019ve been doing this? They\u2019ve gotten more information. They know more about more asset classes. There are fewer secrets in the world today.On the other hand, I think they are more shortsighted, more short term oriented than they used to be.And while people now understand more about contrarianism and counterintuitiveness, I don\u2019t think the human race has become less emotional.So it\u2019s kind of a holding action.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Sense of the Selling in the Stock Market", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome stock declines are more foreboding than others.The selling that has driven down the markets continued on Friday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 9 percent from its peak in September, and on pace for its worst month since the 2008 financial crisis. Swoons like this one can be unnerving, in part because they suggest all is not well with the broader economy.But some of the selling may not augur much.Take technology stocks, whose recent declines have played a big role in dragging down the overall market. Shares of big tech companies have soared this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up more than 17 percent at its peak this year and 55 percent since Donald J. Trump was elected president.That left tech stocks vulnerable to a sharp sell-off.That\u2019s why the declines in shares of companies like Netflix and Amazon this month say more about their stock market valuations than the state of the wider economy.Earlier this year, Netflix was trading at 110 times the earnings Wall Street analysts expected the company to make over the next 12 months, according to FactSet. That multiple is many times that of the wider market and suggests that investors were confident Netflix would deliver on its ambitious goals. But big questions, including its ability to finance its growth and rising competition, hang over the company. The drop in Netflix\u2019s stock is thus evidence of healthy skepticism, rather than kneejerk bearishness about its future.But other selling cannot be so easily shrugged off.Bank stocks are down a lot this year. That\u2019s despite a strong economy, which typically leads to increased lending activity; rising interest rates, which have bolstered the profitability of banks\u2019 core lending business; the tax cuts enacted last year, which had an outsize effect on bank profits; and hopes for deregulation. Yet the shares of Citigroup, the nation\u2019s third largest bank, are down nearly 20 percent from their high earlier this year. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are all down about 15 percent this year.If bank stocks are a barometer for the economy, their poor performance points to some of the questions that keep investors up at night. Will President Trump\u2019s trade war soon start to do real damage to corporate earnings and the global economy? Will the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases crimp economic activity by depriving companies and households of the loans they need to finance purchases?A rout helps investors decide what\u2019s worth really worrying about. With the United States economy growing strongly, they may soon decide they\u2019ve been freaking out too much. A sustained upturn in bank stocks may show that their optimism is returning. But if they remain in the doldrums, real trouble may lie ahead.Advertisement"}

The rise pulled the stock market back into positive territory for 2018 a day after a turbulent session had erased the last of the year\u2019s gains. Stocks are now up 1.2 percent this year.The rally on Thursday was a rare upward jolt in what has been a rough run for stocks. Investors have dumped shares over the past month, worried about factors that could threaten the economic and profit outlook for 2019, including the trade war with China, the Fed\u2019s plans to keep raising interest rates and the midterm elections.Those worries have largely outweighed the strong third-quarter sales and profit numbers that companies have reported since earnings season began this month. Thanks to a strong economy and corporate tax cuts, third-quarter profits for S.&P. 500 companies were on track to be up more than 22 percent, according to an analysis of reported results and projections by the market data firm Refinitiv.Instead, investors are scanning results for any indication \u2014 either in the profit guidance companies offer to analysts or in commentary from executives \u2014 that their fears of a rocky time ahead are warranted.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the guidance,\u201d said Maneesh Deshpande, head of United States equity strategy at Barclays. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really driving stock movements.\u201dOn Thursday, stock in International Paper rose 10.3 percent after it posted better-than-expected results.

Xilinx, a maker of programmable chips used in large data centers, shot up more than 15 percent after it increased full-year profit guidance.And Xilinx was only the S.&P. 500\u2019s second-best performer.Twitter posted its results, with revenue and profit topping forecasts, before the start of trading on Thursday, and its stock jumped 15.5 percent. Large tech companies also climbed. Shares of Microsoft, which reported positive results after the close of trading on Wednesday, rose 5.8 percent.The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose nearly 3 percent and is now up 6 percent for the year, but is nonetheless down 9.8 percent from its peak in early September.If investors were hoping that Thursday\u2019s rise means the latest period of volatility is at an end, they\u2019ll most likely be disappointed.Amazon, which rose more than 7 percent during the day, promptly tumbled in after-hours trading, after the release of its earnings report, which included a holiday forecast investors found underwhelming. And Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, whose shares had risen, dropped sharply when its results likewise disappointed.As long as investors feel that they don\u2019t have a good sense of what next year will look like, such volatility will almost certainly continue. More market swings could leave it ultimately treading water until conditions become more clear, Mr. Deshpande said.\u201cUntil we get through this we\u2019re just going to have this range-bound and very choppy market,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Biggest Buyers of American Stocks Are on the Sidelines Right Now", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerican companies are the largest source of demand for American stocks, and sharp tumbles have come when their buying slows. Another element worth considering? The biggest buyers probably aren\u2019t buying. It may seem counterintuitive, but the largest single source of demand for American stocks is the American companies that issue them. Companies are on track to repurchase more than $770 billion in their own stock this year, according to research from Goldman Sachs. That\u2019s more than twice the size of the next largest source of demand, exchange-traded funds, which last year bought $347 billion in shares. But those companies are getting ready to report earnings, an event that is preceded by a regular slowdown in buyback activity. Some large market dips in the past year have coincided with these quarterly slowdowns. Keith Parker, head of United States equity research at UBS Investment Research, said the market has been weaker when buybacks have slowed. \u201cWhen that dries up or slows significantly, you\u2019re having outsized market effects,\u201d he said. When companies have more cash than they believe they can use productively, they typically return it to shareholders either with cash payments \u2014 known as dividends \u2014 or by repurchasing shares in the market. Buybacks raise demand, putting upward pressure on share prices.Such repurchases have boomed this year as the strong economy \u2014 and steep cuts in corporate tax rates \u2014 have left American companies flush with profits. Companies including Apple, Cisco Systems and Amgen have returned billions in cash to shareholders by buying back shares. Apple is responsible for the largest sum, spending nearly $64 billion on buybacks in the 12 months ending in June 2018, the last period for which full data is available, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.But corporate buybacks regularly slow around the start of the earnings reporting season, because companies want to avoid any potential legal risks from buying stock ahead of publishing their financial results. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out there buying stock if you know good news is about to come out and the market doesn\u2019t know it,\u201d said Charles Elson, a professor of finance and corporate governance at the University of Delaware. This year, periods of reduced buyback activity have, at times, been accompanied by sharp sell-offs in stock markets. Around the time when buybacks dried up in late January, according to UBS data, the S.&P. 500 suffered an ugly drop, falling more than 10 percent from a record high. The market stabilized alongside corporate buying in early February. Likewise, a buyback slowdown in April was accompanied by a tumble in stocks. The stock market\u2019s capricious behavior cannot be traced to a single factor, of course. But a slowdown in buybacks effectively removes a lot of motivated buyers from the American exchanges, which might have been a stabilizing force.\u201cNo one else buys back share proportionately anything like the U.S.,\u201d said Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a uniquely U.S. phenomenon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "These Funds Aim to Power Their Returns With Clean Energy", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you worry about climate change and have some money to spare, it\u2019s natural to wonder whether investing in green energy might plump your returns while helping to stem rising temperatures.A growing number of stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds specialize in the so-called green- or clean-energy industry. They invest not only in the expected companies, like generators of solar and wind power and their suppliers, but also in less obvious ones, like makers of LED light bulbs, electric cars and automobile batteries.Buying into one of these funds means betting on a burgeoning, if volatile, sector and pinning the green in your wallet to your hopes for a more verdant future.Demand for renewable energy is surging, according to the International Energy Agency, a nongovernmental organization based in Paris. As a result, growth in solar- and wind-powered electricity generation is far outstripping that of coal- and natural-gas-fueled generation, the group said in its \u201cRenewables 2017\u201d report. China\u2019s embrace of solar power has been the main engine for this growth, but the United States is the second-strongest market for renewables, the agency said.Even the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett has taken steps toward going green: MidAmerican Energy, one of the subsidiaries of his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, is aiming to obtain 100 percent of its electricity from wind power by 2020.\u201cDecarbonization is a huge and enduring trend, and it\u2019s being led by the private sector now, like Facebook going 100 percent renewable,\u201d said Pavel S. Molchanov, a senior vice president and energy analyst with Raymond James, the financial services company. In August, Facebook, too, announced that it was striving to power its operations with renewables by the end of 2020.But whether investors in mutual funds and E.T.F.s have any effect on the choices being made by companies like Facebook and the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is a subject of debate among investment experts and fund managers.Mr. Molchanov counts himself among the skeptics. \u201cIf a person sells a coal stock, someone is going to buy it,\u201d he said. \u201cWill that action lead to less coal being burned? No. For someone to contribute to decarbonization, the way they can do it is by putting solar on their rooftop.\u201dSome managers of green-energy funds disagree, saying individual investments do help the energy transition, even if they don\u2019t lead to the shuttering of a coal-fired power plant tomorrow.By signaling consumer interest, investment in these companies also can create a virtuous cycle, potentially pulling in even more money, said Jeff Waller, a principal in the global climate finance group at Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Colorado. \u201cYou\u2019re demonstrating there\u2019s demand from the average investor,\u201d he said. \u201cPension funds and 401(k) managers will want to meet that demand. That can create a larger pool of capital focused on this market, which can only help.\u201dJon F. Hale, global head of sustainability research for Morningstar, likened an individual\u2019s green energy bets to \u201cvoting with your money.\u201d Those sorts of \u201cvotes\u201d can embolden fund companies to offer more products and be more aggressive in supporting and even pushing for corporate environmental investments and initiatives.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had the philosophy that the fund exists to build a green energy future,\u201d said Murray D. Rosenblith, one of the portfolio managers of New Alternatives. Mr. Rosenblith said he joined his co-manager, David J. Schoenwald, who founded New Alternatives with his father, in the belief that the fund was contributing to the advancement of renewable energy. \u201cI was a peace activist and had run a charitable foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have come here if I didn\u2019t believe we were helping.\u201dOver the five years ending on Sept. 28, Fidelity\u2019s fund returned an annualized average of 9.75 percent and New Alternatives 6.73 percent, compared with an annualized average of 13.95 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.Calvert opted to go its own way because it judged many of the existing indexes to be too concentrated, Ms. Huang said. The WilderHill index contains 39 stocks and the S.&P. index 29, compared with more than 150 for Calvert\u2019s index. \u201cSo we\u2019re offering a product that\u2019s more diversified but still addresses the energy crisis,\u201d she said.No standard recipe exists for what a renewable energy fund should contain. Some funds broaden their potential pool of holdings by including a salmagundi of stocks.Take Fidelity. Its fund can \u201clook at any company out there trying to push for environmental change in its industry,\u201d said its manager, Kevin G. Walenta. Only about half of its assets are dedicated to renewable energy and energy efficiency stocks. The fund also contains waste-management, water and agricultural holdings. That broad remit suits Mr. Walenta, who said he prefers to invest in longstanding companies and shies away from newer technologies.Energy efficiency, in particular, is a favored theme. \u201cThe payback period for efficiency investments gets better every year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the companies have brand power and long histories of positive economic profits.\u201d As an example, he pointed to Ingersoll Rand, a more-than-a-century-old manufacturer that makes efficient heating and air-conditioning systems. It has lately been one of the fund\u2019s top holdings.Mr. Hale, of Morningstar, said an investor shouldn\u2019t let concern about climate change be all that determines the amount of an investment in renewable energy. A green-energy fund or E.T.F. can supplement a diversified portfolio, with, say, a 5 percent or 10 percent allocation, but it does not take the place of a core holding, he said.A concern when considering such an investment might be the climate-change skepticism of the Trump administration. The solar- and wind-power industries are supported by federal tax credits. And the president likes to talk up coal, and he pulled the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement, the international accord through which countries worldwide committed to goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. If the Trump administration were to push for further changes in federal energy policy, that might hurt renewables.But Lucas White, manager of the GMO Climate Change Fund, said doings in Washington no longer bedevil wind and solar power all that much, as the industries are now mature enough that federal support isn\u2019t crucial for their growth. (Mr. White\u2019s fund, with a minimum initial investment of $10 million, is intended for institutional investors, like pension funds.) \u201cCosts have come down much faster than anyone thought was possible,\u201d he said.Mr. White noted that James L. Robo, chief executive of NextEra Energy, one of the country\u2019s largest power generators, has predicted that solar and wind power will be cheaper than coal or nuclear generation by the beginning of the next decade. \u201cWhen that happens, that\u2019s a massive change in the global energy landscape,\u201d Mr. White said.He is also among those who say that fund and E.T.F. investments can help green energy producers and other companies involved in climate-change mitigation and adaptation.\u201cThis may sound a little squishy, but if no one was willing to invest in these companies, they wouldn\u2019t exist,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Now, much of that is going away. To an entire generation of young shoppers, Sears is the store they least want to visit in the mall they rarely patronize.But for much of its 132-year history, the company was at the forefront of American retail. Its early mail-order and distribution innovations made it the Amazon of the Gilded Age.In the last decade, however, little of that splendor has been evident. The company has lost money for years, its head count has fallen by hundreds of thousands of employees, and it has several thousand fewer stores than it did in 2008. Even the landmark Sears Tower in Chicago \u2014 which it no longer owns \u2014 was renamed, after an insurance company. Here are some key moments in Sears history.1886 Richard Sears, a railway station agent, started the R.W. Sears Watch Company in Minneapolis after buying a batch of watches from a local jeweler and selling them to fellow agents. The next year, he moved the business to Chicago and hired Alvah C. Roebuck, a watchmaker, through a classified ad.189619061925Nearly 40 years after going into business, the company opened its first retail store, in Chicago. Within five years, it had more than 300 outlets, selling in-house brands like Kenmore and Craftsman.The expansion was coordinated by Robert E. Wood, a general during World War I. He realized, while examining census data, that increasingly mobile Americans were moving into and around cities and wanted to browse products in person.The company later created Allstate Insurance, a nod to the growing number of customers with cars. In 1931, retail sales topped mail-order sales.1957The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index debuted with Sears as one of the original members (a position the company exited in 2012).

{"Headline": "Tencent Is Suffering a One-Two Punch From the Tech Stock Sell-Off", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsTencent is exposed to a double dose of pain as a global tech rout gathers pace.On Wednesday, United States technology stocks fell sharply. But even against that backdrop and a similar plight afflicting Chinese rivals, the Hong Kong-listed gaming giant Tencent stands apart. It has lost $230 billion of market value from its peak in January, which is magnified by fickle Chinese traders and its exposure to emerging markets.Investors have wiped out about 40 percent of the tech titan\u2019s market value so far this year: it is now worth $348 billion. That compares to the less than 30 percent declines suffered by its U.S.-listed Chinese rivals Alibaba and Baidu over the same period. Slowing earnings growth and an unforeseen regulatory crackdown on mobile games, Tencent\u2019s core business, by the Chinese government triggered the slump. But it has since snowballed amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and concerns of a slowing economy in the People\u2019s Republic.Tencent\u2019s listing location is one reason it is getting hit harder than other tech companies. Analysts at BNP Paribas believe that it\u2019s currently the top-selling name on the Stock Connect scheme linking mainland exchanges to Hong Kong, which allows investors in China to trade the company\u2019s shares. That means Tencent is exposed to flighty Chinese investors, who tend to be quicker than most to buy and sell, making the good times richer \u2014 and the bad times poorer.A capital flight is also playing a part. Tencent is the top company in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, with a 4.5 percent weighting. The index has slumped 14 percent this year, largely because of outflows from riskier markets as the U.S. Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy. By contrast, Alibaba\u2019s weighting in the index is 3.7 percent and Baidu\u2019s only 1.2 percent.Tencent has responded to its decline with share buybacks. The company has been stepping up repurchases, spending $100 million since September, according to filings. But the amount it has bought \u2014 just 0.03 percent of its shares outstanding \u2014 is too small to make a real difference. Tencent shares still trade at almost 26 times forward earnings, according to Refinitiv data, but the premium is narrowing to its top rival Alibaba at 23 times.If that closes, Tencent will have one more thing to worry about.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Drove Stocks Skyward. It Was a Different Story on the Way Down.", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLarge technology companies, and the big profits they produce, lifted the markets earlier this year. But during October\u2019s tumble they were only part of a broad-based downturn. The world\u2019s largest technology companies drove the stock market to record highs earlier this year. As stocks have tumbled, though, it\u2019s more like they\u2019re just along for the ride.Unlike the rally, the rout that started in late September and dominated trading in October was a broad-based affair. That suggests that investors are less concerned that the tech giants\u2019 shares rose too far too fast, and are instead worried about the fundamentals of the United States economy and the continuing profitability of companies of all kinds.October was particularly painful for investors. At its worst, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down more than 9 percent during the month. A late charge took some of the sharp edge off: The S.&P. 500 was up around 1 percent on Wednesday, its second straight gain, helping to cut losses for the month to around 7 percent. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that\u2019s bothering the markets and I think it\u2019s fears about earnings estimates,\u201d said Randy Watts, chief investment strategist with the investment advisory firm William O\u2019Neil & Company. And only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. There are plenty of factors worrying investors: President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.\u201cDespite the fact that earnings are exceptional by any objective measure, investors are concerned that they will slow more dramatically than expected next year,\u201d said Jason DeSena Trennert, managing partner at Strategas Research Partners, a markets and economic analysis firm. The tech companies\u2019 declines are not minor, but they are not big enough to signal that investors are overly concerned about the health of the stocks that fueled so much of the gains of the past decade.

It may not be able to have it both ways.It\u2019s not Facebook\u2019s size that caused the issues. Size makes a platform attractive to hackers, but it also gives that platform more resources to defend itself. If there were, say, five smaller social networks in place of Facebook, that would probably make the situation far worse, because each would be more vulnerable to attack, and when serious problems arose, it would be harder to track down the bad behavior and figure out how to thwart it.Instead, he argues that there\u2019s a bigger problem: \u201cWe haven\u2019t agreed on a set of goals for how social media should impact civil society.\u201d Before we rush to tear up Facebook, he writes, we should work out if social media can be changed to improve society \u2014 as happened to newspapers, radio and TV \u2014 by demanding more from the companies.Mr. Hoffman concedes, though, that his approach would mean \u201ca long and never-ending process.\u201dMr. Nordhaus was cited for his work on the implications of environmental factors, including climate change. Mr. Romer was cited for his work on the importance of technological change.It\u2019s all about market failure. Left alone, markets will generate too much pollution (Nordhaus) and too few ideas (Romer).Avoiding global warming is expensive. Dealing with the damage that it causes could be financially ruinous.To avoid that fate, the report urges huge transformations of the world economy in the next few years. That means taxing carbon dioxide emissions (perhaps as high as $27,000 per ton by 2100), investments in clean energy (of $2.4 trillion every year through 2035), and a complete end of coal use by 2050.But such swift and unified change is politically unlikely, especially with President Trump intending to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.Traditional Republican donors like Paul Singer are still giving money to the party, but others have broken rank. Seth Klarman, the hedge fund billionaire, plans to give $20 million to Democrats. Other financiers are backing obscure Democratic candidates for Congress.Some of Wall Street\u2019s Democratic supporters say they\u2019re driven by opposition to President Trump.

He took his concerns to Jeff Dean, the tech giant\u2019s head of A.I. What happened, according to Kate Conger and Cade Metz of the NYT:According to Dr. Poulson, Mr. Dean said that Google complied with surveillance requests from the federal government and asked rhetorically if the company should leave the United States market in protest.

President Trump, his family and more than a few of his appointees are using his presidency to enrich themselves. They are spending taxpayer dollars for their own benefit. They are accepting sweetheart deals from foreigners. And they are harnessing the power of the federal government on behalf of their businesses. There\u2019s a word for this: corruption. Given how widespread Trumpian corruption has become, we thought it was time to make a list. It\u2019s meant to be a definitive list of self-dealing by the president, his family, his staff or his friends \u2014 since he began running for president. To qualify, an incident needs to seem highly credible, even if it remains unresolved, and needs to involve making money. Compiling the list made us understand why some historians believe Trump\u2019s administration is the most corrupt since at least Warren Harding\u2019s, of 1920s Teapot Dome fame. Trump administration officials and people close to them are brashly using power to amass perks and cash. They are betting that they can get away with it. So far, Congress has let them.Here\u2019s the list, sorted into thematic categories:That celebration fits a pattern. Officials from foreign governments have realized they can curry favor with Trump by spending money at his properties. The list of governments includes Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Bahrain, Azerbaijan, Turkey, China, India, Afghanistan and Qatar. Some may have done so even if he were not the president, but others are well aware of what they are doing. The president has played golf at his properties dozens of times since taking office. He refers to his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, as the winter White House. Shortly after his election, he celebrated New Year\u2019s along with 800 guests there, with tickets costing more than $500. And Kellyanne Conway, a top Trump adviser, once encouraged people to buy clothes from Ivanka Trump\u2019s line \u2014 while Conway was giving a television interview from the White House. The president and his aides have repeatedly shown they are willing to use the government\u2019s prestige and power to help their friends and relatives make money. Among the examples:Several Trump officials \u2014 current and former \u2014 have traded stocks while serving in top government positions. In some cases, they appear to have made policy decisions benefiting the companies in which they owned a stake.Corey Lewandowski, the former manager of Trump\u2019s campaign, is paid for work that looks very much like lobbying \u2014 such as participating in a lobbying firm\u2019s phone calls with clients and doing work on behalf of T-Mobile, the telecommunications company firm. But Lewandowski has not registered as a lobbyist and says he does not need to do so. Trump officials have made a habit of billing American taxpayers for their personal travel. Ryan Zinke, Trump\u2019s secretary of the interior, chartered a $12,000 flight to fly out of Las Vegas, where he had given a 12-minute speech to a hockey team owned by a businessman who donated to his congressional campaign.And Price, the former health secretary, spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on private planes. His history of unethical stock trading didn\u2019t keep Trump from naming Price to the cabinet. But the private-plane scandal received enough attention that the White House eventually forced Price to resign.The pettiest kind of Trumpian corruption takes the form of interior decorating. It has shirked its constitutional duty.The biggest scandal of all, however, is not even the corruption of the Trump administration. It\u2019s the inaction of Congress. The founders were well aware that the government they were creating could end up with corrupt or unethical leaders, all the way up to the president. That\u2019s why the Constitution gives Congress tremendous power to investigate and even remove officials in the executive branch.Yet the current congressional leaders \u2014 the Republican leaders \u2014 have refused to do so. They have shirked their duty to act as a check on the president and his appointees. They have instead defended Trump and made excuses on his behalf. They have enabled the most corrupt administration of our lifetimes.What\u2019s missing from this list?

{"Headline": "Far-Right Candidate Jair Bolsonaro Widens Lead in Brazil\u2019s Presidential Race", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Jair Bolsonaro, the populist, far-right candidate leading the pack, spent much of the final stretch in a hospital bed, convalescing from a near-fatal stabbing, occasionally posting selfies and shaky videos in which he looked feeble and groggy. His near-disappearance from the political stage only increased his lead: polls suggest Mr. Bolsonaro will trounce opponents in the election on Sunday.His success has defied the laws of political gravity. Until recently, Mr. Bolsonaro was a provocateur on the fringes of power who accomplished little as a seven-term lawmaker, but made headlines by calling for a military dictatorship and verbally attacking women, gays and people of color \u2014 in a country that is mostly nonwhite.Until early August, he did not even have a running mate because traditional parties and politicians found him toxic.But much like President Trump and populist leaders around the world, Mr. Bolsonaro has tapped into a deep well of resentment at the political establishment. He channeled Brazilians\u2019 anger over staggering levels of corruption and crime, presenting himself as the only candidate tough enough to solve them.\u201cBrazilians want a hero,\u201d said Daniel Machado, a professor of political marketing, referring to Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s vow to take radical measures to fix Brazil.\u201cWe need to break that system together,\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro, 63, told followers earlier this week during one of his daily live videos on Facebook.A year ago, most power brokers in Brazil regarded Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s presidential bid as fanciful, deeming him too incendiary to take the helm of the world\u2019s fourth largest democracy. Veteran political strategists and analysts thought his appeal would ebb as the campaign season officially kicked off in August.After all, Mr. Bolsonaro is also the most reviled contender in the field, with a 45 percent disapproval rate. But as Election Day approaches, centrist candidates with larger war chests and robust networks of support are seeing their political base drift toward Mr. Bolsonaro.His popularity only grew after he was stabbed while being carried by supporters during a political rally in September. The assailant told police officers at the scene that he was carrying out \u201can order from God,\u201d which led investigators to question his mental health. But the attack played into Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s message about the need to get tough on crime, analysts said.But many of his backers argue that he represents the only way to defeat the most powerful and corrupt presence on the Brazilian political scene in recent years \u2014 the leftist Workers\u2019 Party, which governed from 2003 to 2016.When the presidential race got underway, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a charismatic former metal worker and founding member of the Workers\u2019 Party, was the front-runner by a wide margin. Many Brazilians, particularly the poor and the working class in this deeply unequal country, identify with Mr. da Silva personally and long for the prosperity they experienced during his tenure. He stepped down in 2011 with record-high approval ratings.Since then, the party\u2019s standing has slipped. Mr. da Silva\u2019s successor, Dilma Rousseff, oversaw the deepest recession in Brazil\u2019s history. She was impeached in 2016 for obscuring a budget deficit.So less than a month before Election Day, the Workers\u2019 Party officially nominated Fernando Haddad, a former education minister and mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, betting that Mr. da Silva\u2019s base would transfer its allegiance to him. This was effective enough to push Mr. Haddad \u2014 a 55-year-old economist, lawyer and history professor with little national name recognition \u2014 into second place in the polls.The matchup between Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. Haddad has crystallized a bitter societal divide in Brazil that has widened in recent years amid the economic woes and public disgust at bribery schemes that tainted much of the political and business elite.While foes see a Bolsonaro presidency as potentially catastrophic for the country\u2019s young democracy, his supporters warn that returning the Workers\u2019 Party to power would put Brazil on the type of ruinous path that has engulfed neighboring Venezuela.\u201cI lived through the era of the dictatorship and not even then did I witness so much hate, so much division, so much aggression,\u201d said Clara Strauss, 79, during a recent demonstration against Mr. Bolsonaro. \u201cIt\u2019s not characteristic of Brazilians.\u201dBrazilians are distrustful of more than just politicians. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolsonaro has sowed skepticism and at times outright hostility toward the press. He has dismissed critical stories \u2014 including investigations into his real estate holdings and a messy divorce \u2014 as \u201cfake news.\u201d That approach has resonated with many Brazilians who see large news organizations as beholden to the elite.Karine Neder, 45, an interior designer from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais state, said she started leaning toward Mr. Bolsonaro as media coverage of him became increasingly negative in recent months. She became a fervent admirer as Mr. Bolsonaro vowed to take drastic measures to restore security, like tougher prison sentences.\u201cWe live in a country where you can\u2019t watch the national news at night without being afraid of going to work the next day,\u201d she said after attending a rally for the candidate in Rio de Janeiro.While rivals enjoyed considerably more free airtime on television \u2014 which is allocated according to a political party\u2019s size \u2014 and spent heavily on polished ads, Mr. Bolsonaro proved very adept at using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to reach voters.\u201cHe had the time and this new, unfettered space to occupy the collective imagination,\u201d Mr. Machado, the professor of political marketing, said.Bolsonaro fans created hundreds of group chats on the messaging app WhatsApp, which has become a prodigious channel to spread misinformation during elections in Latin America.Mr. Bolsonaro is considered a conservative for his hard-line approach to security, his staunch opposition to abortion rights and his disdain for the type of affirmative action initiatives the Workers\u2019 Party created to chip away at Brazil\u2019s steep inequality.But how he would manage the economy \u2014 the world\u2019s eighth largest \u2014 remains unclear.Mr. Bolsonaro and his surrogates have offered few detailed policy prescriptions and have backed contradictory positions on central issues, such as whether large state enterprises should be privatized.The policy blueprint on his campaign website is heavy on exclamation marks and short on details. \u201cOur strategy will be to adopt the same actions that work in countries that are booming, with jobs, low inflation, wages for workers and opportunity for all,\u201d his policy document proclaims.Mr. Bolsonaro has reacted with exasperation when interviewers have pressed him for details on how he would handle the economy, which is only now emerging from the recession.\u201cI\u2019m an artillery captain,\u201d he barked during a recent televised interview on the Globo News network. \u201cWhy would I talk about the economy?\u201dMany experts see him as ill equipped to tackle complex challenges that will ultimately need to be addressed, including pension and tax reform.\u201cThe military, when they took power in \u201864, and established a dictatorship, had a plan,\u201d said Helo\u00edsa Starling, a historian at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. \u201cWe may have disagreed with it, but they had a plan. He doesn\u2019t have a plan for the country.\u201dBut that has not fazed investors. They appear to have faith that Paulo Guedes, a University of Chicago-educated economist whom Mr. Bolsonaro has said he would appoint as finance minister, would push market-friendly reforms and rein in the social spending that mushroomed under the Workers\u2019 Party. As Mr. Bolsonaro has surged in the polls, markets have rallied, with stocks and the real currency rebounding.As a Bolsonaro victory has appeared increasingly likely, ardent opponents have rallied online and in the streets under the motto #EleN\u00e3o, or Not Him. But the demonstrations have not dented his support, which has left many of those who ardently oppose him feeling despondent.\u201cWe used to think that rights that have been conquered were rights that had been consolidated,\u201d said Ms. Schwarcz, the historian. \u201cI\u2019ve concluded that we were being foolish. We must continue fighting for them.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The declines were widespread, touching everything from previously high-flying tech shares to usually insulated sectors like consumer staples and utilities.When the dust settled, every sector of the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index had dropped, leaving the stock market benchmark down an additional 2.1 percent. That slump followed Wednesday\u2019s 3.3 percent decline, which was the market\u2019s biggest dive in eight months.So far in October \u2014 which looms large in the minds of investors as the month of the 1929 and 1987 crashes \u2014 stocks are down 6.4 percent. That puts the month on a pace to be the worst October for stocks since 2008, when they fell nearly 17 percent.\u201cToday it feels a lot more like there\u2019s just money coming out of the market,\u201d said John Linehan, chief investment officer for equities at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. \u201cI think there\u2019s a level of anxiety about the market, especially given how far we\u2019ve come.\u201dEarly Friday, markets in Asia suggested the damage could be moderating, as Chinese shares matched Wall Street\u2019s drop but stocks in Japan, Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region were largely flat.Investors who have ridden the nearly decade-long bull market in stocks are now contending with a growing crop of concerns, including rising borrowing costs that could dampen economic growth and growing tensions between the United States and China. Worries about rising interest rates eased briefly early in the day after a report showing muted inflation helped send yields on government bonds lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ended the day just below 3.15 percent, lower than it had been in several days.Though the S.&P. has fallen from its most recent peaks in January and September, it is still up more than 20 percent since President Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017.+30%Percentage changein the S.&P. 500-stock index \u2026+25+20\u2026 Since Trump\u2019sinauguration:+20.5%+15+10+5\u2026 Since the market\u2019s previouspeak on Jan. 26: \u20135.0%0Inauguration\u20135Correctionterritory\u201310\u2026 Since themarket\u2019s peakon Sept. 20: \u20136.9%\u20131520172018+30%+25Percentage change in theS.&P. 500-stock index \u2026+20\u2026 Since Trump\u2019sinauguration:+20.5%+15+10+5\u2026 Since the market\u2019s previouspeak on Jan. 26: \u20135.0%0Inauguration\u20135Correction territory\u2026 Since themarket\u2019s peakon Sept. 20: \u20136.9%\u201310\u20131520172018Source: Refinitiv | By The New York TimesChristine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned on Thursday that if the tensions between the United States and China continued to escalate, \u201cthe global economy would take a significant hit.\u201d\u201cOur strong recommendation,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said at a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, \u201cis to de-escalate those tensions and to work toward a global trade system that is stronger, that is fairer, and that is fit for purpose and fit for the future.\u201dReflecting concerns about the global economy, commodity prices also tumbled on Thursday, with the decline in oil prices, for example, weighing on shares of energy producers.Earlier in the day, stocks were hit particularly hard in Asia, where no market was spared in the sweeping sell-off. Stocks in Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul, South Korea, dropped 4 percent or more.Shares also fell in Europe on Thursday, though the declines were less extreme than in the United States or Asia. The region is also vulnerable to a long list of economic risks, including the possibility of a disorderly exit by Britain from the European Union and the potential for Italy to provoke a new eurozone debt crisis.Italy\u2019s populist government has drafted a spending plan that would defy European budget rules to fulfill election promises. The market interest rates on Italian bonds have spiked as investors worry that the country may not be able to service its debt, which is equivalent to more than 130 percent of annual economic output.While geopolitical issues have sprung to the fore, subtler shifts in the backdrop of the stock market might be producing outsize reactions. With the bulk of the earnings season about to start on Friday, many American companies have paused their share repurchase programs to comply with blackout periods, potentially worsening stock market swings.\u201cThat\u2019s another level of support that\u2019s sort of gone in this period,\u201d said Marina Severinovsky, an investment strategist at the asset manager Schroders.More broadly, investors are readjusting to the slow withdrawal of support from central banks \u2014 such as the Federal Reserve \u2014 which has acted as a tailwind for stocks since the market rally began in March 2009.The Fed says it will continue to lift interest rates in the face of robust economic growth, despite direct criticism of the policy from Mr. Trump in recent days.The Fed is also starting to significantly shrink its balance sheet, effectively withdrawing some of the money it pumped into the financial system during and after the financial crisis a decade ago.\u201cI think these are kind of the teething pains for asset markets as we kind of get away from super-easy money,\u201d said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix Keeps Adding Subscribers, and Market Investors Could Profit", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by__________More people sitting around watching Netflix may help rekindle some animal spirits in the stock market.The company on Tuesday reported that many more people signed up for its video-streaming service in the third quarter than expected. Netflix\u2019s shares soared as much as 13 percent in the trading that takes place after regular market hours.After the stock market suffered a steep swoon this month, results like that should help stocks recover. Netflix\u2019s report was the first from one of the big technology companies that helped drive the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to a record last month.Investors have charted the performance of these tech stocks by bunching them into a group they call FAANG, which includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Their contribution to the overall market has been significant. In the 12 months through Monday, the S. & P. 500 had risen 7.7 percent, but without the five technology stocks its performance was only 5.2 percent, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse.Netflix is the priciest of the five prominent technology companies. This makes it a good barometer for the amount of bullishness in the stock market. If the stock keeps rising over the coming weeks, it will underscore that investors still have a strong appetite for riskier companies, an attitude that might spill over into other technology firms.As Netflix\u2019s third-quarter results showed, it is doing well in some respects. It added seven million subscribers in the period, a larger amount than it added in the third quarter of last year. But the company is also consuming large sums of cash to finance its growth and borrowing more to cover its shortfall. Netflix also faces serious competitive threats, like Disney\u2019s plan to set up its own subscription video service.Yet an important stock market yardstick \u2014 the price-earnings ratio \u2014 suggests investors have an almost unquestioning faith in Netflix\u2019s ability to notch fast-growing earnings. This ratio compares its stock price with its earnings. Take a company with a stock trading at $100. If investors expect it to make $10 per share (its net income divided by the number of shares it has issued), it would have a price-earnings ratio of 10.The ratio for the companies in the S. & P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.Of course, it\u2019s still early in the earnings reporting season \u2014 and jarring disappointments may occur. Facebook is facing mounting regulatory scrutiny and is spending large sums on making its network more secure. Apple is trying to increase its revenue in part by selling higher-priced phones that may turn off some consumers.Outside of the technology space, investors are concerned that President Trump\u2019s trade wars may hurt the earnings of large manufacturing companies.But after stocks had a wobbly start to October, strong earnings have already helped reassure investors. Before Netflix reported its performance, two well-known Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, reported earnings that provided more evidence that the banking sector is in a good position to finance economic growth.After those reports and a few others, the S. & P. 500 jumped 2.15 percent, its biggest single-day gain since March.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Attacks the Fed as Stocks Fall and the Midterms Loom", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump responded to falling stock prices on Thursday by continuing to throw rocks at the Federal Reserve, which he has described as \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cloco,\u201d \u201cgoing wild\u201d and \u201cout of control\u201d for slowly raising interest rates against the backdrop of a booming economy.No other modern president has publicly attacked the Fed with such venom or frequency. Indeed, some scholars said the only close historical parallel was with President Andrew Jackson, who campaigned successfully in the 1830s to close the Fed\u2019s predecessor, the Second Bank of the United States.Mr. Trump\u2019s pointed remarks reflect the high political stakes less than a month before midterm elections that have been cast by his political opponents as a referendum on his presidency. Mr. Trump has been riding the economy hard, bragging about job creation, tax cuts and reduced federal regulation, and claiming credit for the rise of the stock market. Now that the market has lost 5 percent of its value in the last week, Mr. Trump is insisting someone else is to blame.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index closed at 2,728.37 on Thursday, down 2.06 percent.In fact, despite the stock market\u2019s plunge, the American economy continues to grow, which is what is prompting the Fed to raise interest rates and drawing the president\u2019s ire. The Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, has said that the economy is in a \u201cparticularly bright moment\u201d and that he sees no clouds on the horizon.But after hitching his political fortunes to the rise of the stock market, Mr. Trump is now looking to decouple himself from its fall. Republicans are instead emphasizing continued economic growth and the lowest unemployment rate since 1969.So far, the president\u2019s comments have made little impression on market expectations about Fed policy. Unlike Jackson\u2019s concerted campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks appear curiously unmoored from the policies of his own administration or the longstanding goals of the Republican Party. Mr. Trump\u2019s own aides have insisted that the president\u2019s remarks are personal musings, not an attempt to dictate policy.The Fed has also brushed off the attacks; it still expected to raise rates in December for the fourth time this year.Mr. Powell emphasized that the decision to raise rates to a range between 2 and 2.25 percent was not intended to get in the way of continued growth. \u201cMy colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy and moving forward,\u201d he said.A spokeswoman declined to comment on Thursday.Some experts warned that a continued assault on the Fed could have long-lasting consequences.Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of legal studies at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of a political history of the Fed, pointed to the example of the F.B.I., another institution Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked by raising questions about the integrity of its decision making. Mr. Conti-Brown said technocratic institutions are insulated from political pressure by public confidence. If confidence erodes, it becomes harder for technocrats to resist the politicians.The F.B.I. has seen a loss of leadership, an erosion of morale and an increase in congressional scrutiny.\u201cHow long before the Fed is looking at its political context and saying, \u2018We can\u2019t stick our heads out as far as we need to,\u2019\u201d Mr. Conti-Brown asked rhetorically. \u201cHow long will people stay if the job itself becomes terrible, and there are protesters everywhere you go?\u201d\u201cI think the Fed has gone crazy,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. Later in the day, speaking with Fox News, he continued to increase the heat. \u201cThe Fed is going wild,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what their problem is. They are raising interest rates and it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary, and I think I know more about it than they do.\u201dMr. Trump added that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Mr. Powell but did not plan to fire him \u2014 an authority the president may not even have. While the president in theory has the power to remove a Fed chairman \u201cfor cause,\u201d courts have held that the permissible causes do not include policy disagreements.For the moment, Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of the Fed does not seem to be catching on with Republican candidates. Many Republicans have argued for years that the Fed was waiting too long to raise interest rates, and then that it was moving too slowly. The party is trying to hold on to majorities in the Senate and the House by running on a strong economy and using the heated liberal opposition to Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation as an example of the threat Democrats pose if they control Congress. That dynamic could change, however, if the stock market continues to fall.Modern presidents have always kept an uneasy eye on the Fed, because its decisions about monetary policy have a significant influence on the pace of economic growth.Until the early 1950s, the Fed essentially operated as an arm of the Treasury Department. Even after the Fed gained operational independence, presidents often opined publicly about what the Fed should do and, if the Fed ignored their advice, they sometimes sought to bend its officials to their will.President Lyndon B. Johnson protested a decision to raise interest rates in the late 1960s by summoning the Fed chairman at the time, William McChesney Martin, to his East Texas ranch and pinning the smaller man against a wall. President Richard M. Nixon instructed aides to blackmail Mr. Martin\u2019s successor, Arthur Burns. President George Bush declared in a State of the Union address that the Fed should keep rates low.But the volume of public commentary greatly diminished in recent decades as politicians concluded that pressuring the Fed was counterproductive. The administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all made a policy of silence on monetary policy.Krishna Guha, the head of the central bank strategy team at Evercore ISI, said he did not expect Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks to influence the Fed, and he saw no evidence that markets were paying attention. But he added that if Mr. Trump did succeed, he would most likely regret doing so.If Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks convince markets that the Fed may move more slowly, or show greater tolerance of inflation, bond yields would rise, which would put further downward pressure on equity prices.Still, Mr. Guha \u2014 formerly a senior official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \u2014 said that the president\u2019s criticisms were not good for the central bank or the future conduct of economic policy.\u201cYou never want to be in a position where some part of society doesn\u2019t just question whether you made the right call or not, but whether you made that call in the public interest,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have sought to play down his broadsides. Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, said Mr. Trump was just offering his two cents. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s \u2018calling out the Fed,\u2019 quote unquote,\u201d Mr. Kudlow told reporters outside the White House on Thursday morning. \u201cI really mean this. I think he\u2019s giving you his opinion. He is a, obviously, successful businessman, he\u2019s a very well-informed investor. He has his views. But he\u2019s not saying to them, \u2018Change your plan.\u2019\u201dMr. Kudlow added, \u201cHe knows the Fed is independent, and he respects that.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s criticisms appear strangely at odds with the way he has handled the most powerful means at his disposal to influence monetary policy. Since taking office less than two years ago, he has had the unusual opportunity to fill six of the seven seats on the Fed\u2019s board of governors.He filled the top three positions on the Fed\u2019s board, including the chairman\u2019s job, with members of the Republican policymaking establishment, which has long been committed to keeping inflation firmly under control. Three other nominees, still awaiting confirmation, are a more diverse group, but there is no indication any share Mr. Trump\u2019s stated opposition to raising interest rates.\u201cIn most areas of administrative policy that have been highly politicized, his appointments have privileged politics over competence,\u201d Mr. Conti-Brown said. \u201cThe Fed has been an exception.\u201dA looming question, he said, is whether Mr. Trump might begin to match his actions to his words.Advertisement"}

For months, it had seemed as though nothing could spook stock investors in the United States. Growing corporate profits and surging shares of technology giants pushed major benchmarks to a string of record highs.But concerns about nascent inflation, rising interest rates and the potential for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy came together into a wave of selling Wednesday. In addition, President Trump\u2019s policies toward Beijing have become a drag on technology companies, which rely heavily on China as a manufacturing base. Shares of the companies that make components like semiconductors have been particularly hard hit in the recent selling. Apple shares, for example, slid over 4.5 percent on Wednesday.\u201cIt looks as though Trump is settling most of the trade skirmishes around the world that he started earlier this year with one important exception,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, president of the stock market research firm Yardeni Research. \u201cIt looks like China is going to be a long-term issue.\u201dThough the S.&P. has fallen from its most recent peaks in January and September, it is still up more than 20 percent since President Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017.+30%Percentage changein the S.&P. 500-stock index \u2026+25+20\u2026 Since Trump\u2019sinauguration:+20.5%+15+10+5\u2026 Since the market\u2019s previouspeak on Jan. 26: \u20135.0%0Inauguration\u20135Correctionterritory\u201310\u2026 Since themarket\u2019s peakon Sept. 20: \u20136.9%\u20131520172018+30%+25Percentage change in theS.&P. 500-stock index \u2026+20\u2026 Since Trump\u2019sinauguration:+20.5%+15+10+5\u2026 Since the market\u2019s previouspeak on Jan. 26: \u20135.0%0Inauguration\u20135Correction territory\u2026 Since themarket\u2019s peakon Sept. 20: \u20136.9%\u201310\u20131520172018Source: Refinitiv | By The New York TimesRising interest rates are something of a double-edged sword. They reflect the strength of the American economy, where unemployment is at 49-year lows, but they also mean borrowers looking to buy a home or a car, or invest in a business, will have to pay more to do so. Conventional 30-year mortgage rates are about 5 percent, for example, hurting both home affordability and the share price of home builders.\u201cStock markets like rising interest rates because they tend to signal a strong economic backdrop,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist for Credit Suisse. \u201cThat said, stock markets do not like very abrupt, large moves.\u201dPresident Trump, who has boasted about the stock market rally as shares climbed, took Wednesday\u2019s sell-off as an opportunity to criticize the Federal Reserve, which has also been raising the short-term interest rates under its control. Mr. Trump had previously expressed his displeasure with that policy.\u201cThe Fed is making a mistake,\u201d he said when asked by reporters about the market drop, shortly after landing in Erie, Pa., before a campaign rally. \u201cI think the Fed has gone crazy.\u201d He described the recent selling as \u201ca correction that we\u2019ve been waiting for, for a long time.\u201dBut some policies put into place under Mr. Trump, like tax cuts and increased government spending that have widened the federal deficit, are also a factor in the rise in borrowing costs.The worsening tensions between the Trump administration and China also drew blame for the drop on Wednesday.Earlier in the day, the Treasury Department imposed new rules making it easier to block foreign investment in technology companies on national security grounds, outlining a rigorous review system that is aimed primarily at preventing China from gaining access to sensitive American technology.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.\u201cThere\u2019s an increasing realization in the market that this is not just about the trade deficit. This is about security concerns. This is about geopolitical strength,\u201d said Evan Brown, director of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management. \u201cIt\u2019s about encouraging U.S. companies to move their supply chains out of China. And so there are questions about a broader disruption and potential legislation or scrutiny in these markets.\u201dDespite the tumble on Wednesday, many market observers expect strong third-quarter earnings will be enough to help stocks recover their recent losses. Those reports will start to flow in earnest this Friday, when some of the largest United States banks, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, will post results.Thanks to the strength of the economy and steep cuts in corporate tax rates, corporate earnings are expected to rise more than 20 percent from the third quarter of 2017, according to John Butters, an earnings analyst with FactSet. That would be the third consecutive quarter of earnings growth of more than 20 percent.But that outlook isn\u2019t without risks. As the economy heats up, costs are climbing and starting to eat into relatively fat profit margins.On Wednesday, Fastenal, a company that makes products like industrial supplies used on factory floors, reported better-than-expected profit and sales numbers. But its profit margin was something of a disappointment and the stock fell more than 7 percent.\u201cWe are starting to see some margin pressure from higher raw materials and energy and labor costs,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, equity strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Still, she stressed that strong economic demand should support corporate profits, even if margins contract.That\u2019s one reason she thinks the stock market remains an attractive place for investors, even with rising inflation and interest rates.\u201cI would stick with equities for the time being,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix\u2019s Audience Is Multiplying. But So Is Its Debt.", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesNetflix, the streaming-video juggernaut, is growing with astonishing speed. And if you ignore the fact that it borrows billions to finance that growth, the company is a classic success story.Wall Street has embraced Netflix as one of the so-called Faangs \u2014 short for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (which trades as Alphabet). The technology titans propelled investors to enormous profits for much of this year.With Netflix\u2019s resounding success in forging \u2014 and, so far, dominating \u2014 the global market for streaming video, it may seem churlish to harbor any misgivings.Yet Netflix poses a difficult problem for investors. All of those movies and TV shows are expensive, and in order to fuel its explosive expansion, the company has been spending faster than it has been taking in cash \u2014 and expects to keep doing so for years. Netflix has built its business on a mountain of junk-rated debt.Not everyone is persuaded, however.\u201cNetflix\u2019s fundamental business model seems unsustainable,\u201d said Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, who has examined the company\u2019s numbers closely. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it is going to work out.\u201dWith increased competition looming in streaming video, he said, Netflix must keep spending enormous sums on content and marketing. If it cuts spending, he said, it is likely to lose much of its precious audience.\u201cSure, the company is growing rapidly now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has an amazing number of new movies and TV shows. For a consumer, that\u2019s great. But for an investor, it\u2019s a different story: The more Netflix grows, the more its costs grow and the more money it burns. I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s ever going to turn that around.\u201dThe company\u2019s shares, in his estimation, are worth buying as a serious investment only at about $177. But Netflix has been trading around $310 a share lately, after surpassing $400 earlier this year.In a nutshell, the problem is the disparity between money in and money out \u2014 and Professor Damodaran\u2019s presumption that Netflix\u2019s costs must remain high, if it is to keep growing.Netflix\u2019s cash-flow statement indicates that in the 12 months through September, it spent $11.7 billion on new content. But its income statement indicates that total revenues were $14.9 billion, leaving it only about $3.2 billion to pay for marketing and the rest of its operations. That wasn\u2019t enough to run the business, so the company has borrowed money.Professor Damodaran is not the only Netflix skeptic. In a note to investors on Oct. 17, Michael Nathanson, a senior analyst with MoffettNathanson, said that the company\u2019s stock price was baffling, and he estimated that a more realistic level was about $210.In a similar vein, Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities and a longtime critic, said he expected Netflix to continue to have difficulty matching costs and cash flow, given increasing competition in streaming video \u2014 and the likely loss of movies and TV shows controlled by its competitors.Disney and Time Warner (which owns HBO) are revamping their offerings. And Hulu (owned collectively by Disney and Comcast), Apple, Amazon and Google (which owns YouTube) are now all serious adversaries, he said. In his estimation, Netflix stock is worth only about $150 a share.If Netflix were to fall anywhere near that level \u2014 losing a gut-wrenching half of its market value \u2014 its corporate competitors would presumably be powering ahead with their own streaming offerings. Yet it would not be surprising if some of them \u2014 the recently merged AT&T-Time Warner entity, for example \u2014 wondered whether their own marriages made much sense without Netflix\u2019s unbidden influence.How worried should the stock market be about Netflix? It has shrugged off such concerns most of this year: From Jan. 1 through July 9, Netflix\u2019s shares returned a staggering 118 percent.Since July 9, however, tech stocks have fallen and Netflix has been pummeled. Despite brief surges, its share price has dropped more than 25 percent since that peak.\u201cYou get a show or a movie you\u2019re really dying to watch, and you end up staying up late at night, so we actually compete with sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re winning!\u201dIn the latest earnings call, he said that deep-pocketed companies, like Disney, AT&T and Google, were real competitors. \u201cSomeday there will have to be competition for wallet share; we\u2019re not na\u00efve about that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems very far off from everything we\u2019ve seen.\u201dNetflix, he said, needs to continue to be \u201cfocusing on our fundamentals\u201d \u2014 supplying viewers with compelling entertainment and delivering it in innovative ways.But that will cost the company a lot of money. For consumers, that may not be a problem at all. Netflix has already made video entertainment far more abundant and diverse than it was just a few years ago, and as other companies join the fray, the cornucopia of choices is likely to become even deeper.But does that make Netflix a great stock? You may want to look closely at the numbers.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySlowdowns in investment and retail sales are cooling one of the world\u2019s most important economic engines. As the trade war with the U.S. intensifies, the downturn could get worse. Sputtering growth, soaring debt and an escalating trade war with the United States are increasingly weighing on China\u2019s economy. China\u2019s government on Friday reported that the economy grew by 6.5 percent over the three months that ended in September compared with a year ago. While fast by global standards, the pace is China\u2019s slowest since early 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis.China has reported growth figures over the past two years that painted a picture of an economy that is gamely chugging along, despite the country\u2019s lingering problems and widespread doubts over the reliability of official numbers. A different narrative is emerging this year, one of a slowing economy that is forcing Beijing to make some difficult choices.China\u2019s stock market is firmly in the red \u2014 it has fallen by more than one-quarter since a peak in January \u2014 making it one of the world\u2019s worst performing. Companies are complaining that they cannot get money from lenders, and a handful are defaulting on their loans. The currency has weakened and is hovering near a 10-year low against the American dollar. So far it has only marginally dented China\u2019s $12 trillion economy. In recent weeks, Chinese officials have pointed to figures that show overall trade remains robust despite the conflict. On Friday, Chinese officials introduced an unusual public effort to reassure businesses and investors that China was on the right track. They blamed the lower-than-expected economic figures on global factors but said the government would take steps to keep growth on course.\u201cWe have no reason not to be confident in the bright prospects for China\u2019s economic development,\u201d Liu He, China\u2019s economic czar, told the official Xinhua news agency. China\u2019s stock market rebounded from a Friday drop after the comments from Mr. Liu and other top officials. During periods of economic slowdown, China has turned to local governments to prompt growth through big infrastructure and development projects. That approach fueled growth but saddled key parts of the economy with debt.China\u2019s expanding middle class and its increasingly expensive consumption habits have been an important pillar for growth as China moves away from its dependence on exports and big investment projects.Retail sales stayed buoyant, rising 9.2 percent in September from the previous year, as Chinese consumers continued to buy cars, appliances, smartphones and other goods. The strong numbers will help officials in Beijing to argue that the trade war has left China\u2019s domestic economy largely untouched.But economists warn that the overall rosy picture could change. For example, car sales began to slow in September, according to the China Passenger Car Association. \u201cA month from now may be just the time retailers start to buckle,\u201d wrote analysts at China Beige Book International. The group, which surveys big businesses in China, said retailers reported the worst payroll health of any sector in recent months.In September, the United States put tariffs on $200 billion worth of products coming from China. President Trump has given no indication that he will back down anytime soon.Chinese export figures for September jumped 14.5 percent compared with a year earlier. That unlikely number probably is not a sign that trade is doing well. Some exporters attributed the rise to American companies ramping up orders before new tariffs make their purchases more expensive.While much of the impact of the trade war has yet to be felt, experts say it won\u2019t take long for a slowing economy to start to feel the pinch, especially as officials grapple with other economic problems. The trade war could shave as much as 1.6 percent off China\u2019s economic growth figures next year, according to a recent report from the International Monetary Fund.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to see it in the numbers that are provided and that will just add to the uncertainty,\u201d said Paul Gruenwald, global chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to pinpoint any pressure because we don\u2019t have enough data.\u201d But, he added, \u201cthere is definitely pessimism. It\u2019s just a question of how much it will slow things down.\u201dJust before releasing the economic growth figures on Friday morning, the websites for China\u2019s central bank, insurance and securities regulators posted news media interviews with senior officials giving support to the market. The chairman of the securities regulator went as far as to appeal to certain market participants to buy stocks.\u201cWe encourage private equity funds to purchase shares of listed companies and participate in mergers and acquisitions of listed companies,\u201d said Liu Shiyu, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.Liu He, the economic czar, said later that day to Xinhua that trade frictions with the United States had hurt the stock market, \u201cbut the psychological effect is bigger than the actual impact, frankly speaking.\u201dHe added that the United States and China were in contact, without elaborating. Trade discussions were put on hold in September after the Chinese government declined an invitation by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hold fresh talks.Mr. Liu and Liu Shiyu were joined on Friday by Guo Shuqing, China's top banking regulator, and Yi Gang, who runs China\u2019s central bank, in publicly supporting the market. The coordinated effort by the four most important economic officials in China revealed a high level of concern on the part of the government, said Andrew Polk, a founder of Trivium, a Beijing consulting firm.\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that they need all the heavy hitters out there talking up the markets in order to assuage people\u2019s concerns,\u201d said Mr. Polk. \u201cI find it very remarkable that they chose this strategy, and somewhat alarming.\u201d\u2014 Cao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Uber and Lyft Are in an I.P.O. Race", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUber and Lyft compete aggressively in the American ride-hailing market. And now that competition could extend into a battle for investors as the companies push for stock market debuts in 2019.The first to go public would get dibs on investors eager for a piece of the ride-hailing business. That could be especially important for Lyft, given that its I.P.O. would most likely be swamped by its much bigger rival\u2019s, whose offering would be the biggest to hit the market since Alibaba\u2019s in 2014.Positive earnings reports, including from Goldman Sachs and Netflix, were factors, as were strong economic data, which showed a fourth straight month of industrial production gains and job openings at a record high.The ratio for the companies in the S.&P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.That level of investor risk-taking could augur well for the stock market, Mr. Eavis writes \u2014 but may evaporate if another big tech company, like Facebook, delivers disappointing earnings.To make the strategy work, the administration is counting on its relationship with the Saudis to keep global oil flowing without spiking prices, and to work together on a new policy to contain Iran in the Persian Gulf.Richard Haas of the Council on Foreign Relations summed up the fine line Mr. Trump must walk: \u201cIt\u2019s a neat trick if you can both sanction a country and partner with them at the same time.\u201dJudge Alison Nathan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said that the settlements were \u201cfair, reasonable and will serve the interests of the public and investors.\u201d She did not mention Mr. Musk\u2019s more recent Twitter antics, such as a tweet where he appeared to call the agency the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission.\u201dGoogle has always made its Android operating system available for free. It\u2019s a way to get its apps on as many devices as possible, and to collect data about users and sell advertising. But in Europe, it will now charge handset manufacturers to install apps like Gmail and Google Maps.It\u2019s a response to a European antitrust ruling in July that hit Google with a roughly $5 billion fine for unfairly bundling free Android services to maintain its market dominance. (Google is appealing the decision, but it faced a deadline by which it had to change operations or risk further punishment.)The ultimate effect of the change announced on Tuesday remains to be seen, but European customers will probably see a wider variety of Android devices to choose from. Some will come with Google\u2019s services; others may more prominently feature applications made by competitors.\u201cThe potential amount of debt is an iceberg with titanic credit risks,\u201d S.&P. credit analysts led by Gloria Lu wrote in a report Tuesday. Much of the buildup relates to local government financing vehicles, which don\u2019t necessarily have the full financial backing of local governments themselves.That may be a big worry: China\u2019s economy has slowed and defaults have risen this year. Beijing could struggle to contain this latest debt bubble.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Why Investors in European I.P.O.s are Currently Grabbing Bargains", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsInvestors in European initial public offerings have a lot of choice at the moment, which means they can afford to be picky. They can thank Britain\u2019s impending exit from the European Union.The French solar power company Neoen on Tuesday said it could be valued at up to 1.5 billion euros, about $1.8 billion, in an initial public offering, the same morning as Netherlands-based LeasePlan announced its intention to float. That followed initial price ranges announced this week by the Spanish oil group Cepsa and a self-storage group called Shurgard. For some companies, it\u2019s a treacherous time to raise capital. Britain\u2019s Aston Martin and Funding Circle recently sold shares toward the bottom of their ranges, and have since fallen further.There are good reasons for this torrent of I.P.O.s.First, stock market valuations are rosy after nearly a decade of easy central-bank policy. That may end as the United States Federal Reserve raises rates. Europe\u2019s STOXX 50 index has been trading at close to 10 times forward earnings since early 2014, compared with an average over the last decade of 8.8 times. And since companies\u2019 current owners can only sell down their stakes slowly after an I.P.O., it makes sense to list well before markets turn.Second, the possibility of a no-deal Brexit early next year is spooking bankers. Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain has said that leaving the bloc in March 2019 without a tariffs or customs agreement in place is preferable to a \u201cbad deal.\u201d Even if that is just posturing, some members of May\u2019s party could vote down a deal that she brings to parliament, which could lead to Britain falling out of the bloc with a possible Europe-wide market collapse. As a result, bankers are hurrying to get deals done now.In the current deluge of I.P.O.s, bankers have to price offerings modestly in order to get attention. Cepsa\u2019s initial range, for example, was below initial expectations for the Abu Dhabi-owned group.Boring companies with easy-to-understand businesses \u2014 like the braking systems maker Knorr-Bremse \u2014 will be an easier sell than those with complex business models, like the loss-making peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle and serially bankrupt Aston Martin.It had been a sparse year for I.P.O.s in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, with a 6 percent annual decline in volumes in the nine months to September. That forced investors to take what was on offer.With a flood of issues now hitting the market, investors are finally getting the upper hand \u2014 and can choose carefully.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Big Bets Are Great, When They Are Right", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe managers of three mutual funds have been making bigger-than-average bets on their favored ideas, and their shareholders recently benefited.In the language of the investing world, their funds are concentrated, with perhaps a few dozen holdings, instead of the hundreds typical of a big index fund like an Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 offering.Focused investing like this can hurt if the chosen stocks plunge, but that didn\u2019t happen to these funds in the third quarter: The managers\u2019 bets paid off, and the results for each of these concentrated funds landed them among the quarter\u2019s best performers.\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s in the benchmark,\u201d she said. \u201cI never look at it.\u201d That may explain why Ms. Zhang\u2019s fund looks different. More than 80 percent of its assets are allocated to information technology and health care stocks, compared with a little less than 50 percent for the index. \u201cI aim to be a pure stock picker,\u201d not a benchmark hugger, she said.Ms. Zhang\u2019s fund usually holds 50 or fewer small-capitalization stocks. Unlike many portfolio managers, Ms. Zhang said she assembles her holdings based on their revenue, not their market cap. Revenue is a better indication of a company\u2019s life-stage, she said. An enduring outfit can falter and slouch into small-cap territory, but the energetic growers she seeks have small, but swelling, revenues. She said she tries to invest in companies with $500 million or less in revenue. \u201cOur sweet spot is $100 million to $200 million,\u201d she said.She said she divides the small caps into motorboats and sailboats. The ones she wants, the motorboats, have their own propulsion: \u201cThey\u2019re disrupting and transforming a market and taking a market share.\u201d The sailboats, in contrast, are pushed willy-nilly by economic breezes.Take Apptio, one of her fund\u2019s holdings. It makes cloud-based software that helps companies manage their information technology budgets. \u201cThey marry I.T. and financial data to help clients make data-driven decisions,\u201d Ms. Zhang said. \u201cThey\u2019re becoming a must have, instead of a nice to have, for corporations.\u201dApptio invests heavily in research and development \u2014 that spending equals more than 20 percent of its annual sales, a level about twice as high as the typical company in the Russell 2000 index. \u201cWe like to invest in companies that spend a lot on R.&D.,\u201d she said. \u201cHistory has shown \u2014 companies that invest in R.&D. outperform the market.\u201dMs. Zhang\u2019s fund, whose A shares have an expense ratio of 1.2 percent, returned 16.38 percent in the third quarter, compared with 7.71 percent for the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index.The Amana fund is designed to hold stocks acceptable to practicing Muslims. A tenet of Islam is that believers should neither pay nor receive interest, which bars banks from the portfolio, as well as companies with lots of debt, said Mr. Klimo, the deputy portfolio manager.The debt constraint ends up helping the fund with risk management, Mr. Klimo said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for solid companies that aren\u2019t going to blow up,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd companies with strong balance sheets and cash generation can fund their activities internally and aren\u2019t reliant on debt.\u201dHow three of the better performers of the third quarter of 2018 fared against the market \u2014 and against their peer groups of funds.Alger Small Cap FocusAmana GrowthTarkio+20%+20%+20%+15+15+15+10+10+10+5+5+5S. & P. 500TOTAL RET.S. & P. 500TOTAL RET.S. & P. 500TOTAL RET.000JASJASJASTHIRD-QUARTER RETURNSAlger Small Cap FocusAmana GrowthTarkio+16.4%+12.8%+10.5%Small-cap growthLarge-cap growthMid-cap growth+7.2%+7.3%+6.8%Alger Small Cap Focus+20%+15+10+5S. & P. 500TOTAL RET.0JASTHIRD-QUARTER RETURNSAlger Small Cap Focus+16.4%Small-cap growth+7.2%Alger Small Cap Focus+20%+15+10+5S. & P. 500TOTAL RET.0JASTHIRD-QUARTER RETURNSAmana Growth+12.8%Large-cap growth+7.3%Tarkio+20%+15+10+5S. & P. 500TOTAL RET.0JASTHIRD-QUARTER RETURNSTarkio+10.5%Mid-cap growth+6.8%By The New York Times | Source: Morningstar DirectThe fund also avoids so-called \u201csin stocks\u201d \u2014 those that make or sell alcoholic beverages or operate in the gambling or sex-related entertainment industries as well as those that produce fossil fuels. The fossil fuel exclusion has nothing to do with religion.Rather, the managers decided that, since they were already evaluating their holdings based on nonfinancial factors, such as the social impact of a company\u2019s products, it also made sense to assess environmental performance, Mr. Klimo said. As a result, the fund can market itself as one that explicitly factors environmental, social and governance performance in its investment decisions.The screens don\u2019t crimp the managers, Mr. Klimo said. \u201cA lot of the things we talk about are also common sense \u2014 don\u2019t buy overly indebted companies, don\u2019t buy sin stocks.\u201d Debt raises the risk of bankruptcy, and so-called sin stocks can bring bad publicity and lawsuits, he said.Like Ms. Zhang, the Amana managers concentrate the portfolio, holding only 35 stocks.

Piazza, manager of Tarkio, also runs a concentrated portfolio \u2014 lately 34 stocks \u2014 and clings to his favorite companies, which are typically mid-cap offerings.Mr. Fisher also emphasized qualitative factors in assessing stocks, like the integrity and long-term commitment of management and whether employees were treated well and empowered to make decisions, Mr. Piazza said. Tarkio, for example, invested in National Instruments, a maker of testing software and equipment, after Mr. Piazza read that the founder, James J. Truchard, had created a 100-year plan for the company.Mr. Piazza bought the stock in 2011, the year he started Tarkio. Before founding the fund, he managed private accounts, using the same approach, through his investment-management company, Front Street Capital in Missoula, Mont.Several other stocks have been Tarkio holdings since that first year, including Cognex, which makes machine-vision products like bar code readers, and the Rogers Corporation, which makes laminates and other engineered materials. Both Cognex and Rogers were among the fund\u2019s recent top stakes.Being patient and holding relatively few companies pays off in ways that aren\u2019t just financial, Mr. Piazza said.\u201cThe cool thing about being a long-term investor is you don\u2019t even need one new company a year. You can go a couple of years or more without buying a new one.\u201dTarkio Fund, with an expense ratio of 1 percent, returned 10.5 percent in the third quarter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Duterte\u2019s Luster Dulls as Rice Prices Soar in Philippines", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANILA \u2014 Through controversy after controversy, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has always been able to count on his appeal among the nation\u2019s poor. But soaring prices for staples like rice are starting to alienate that vital base of support.But he now faces deepening discontent in an area that particularly affects the urban poor: the price of food.The country\u2019s inflation rate has hit a nine-year record \u2014 6.7 percent \u2014 after climbing for nine consecutive months, the Philippine Statistics Authority said last week. That situation is bad enough that on Tuesday Mr. Duterte ordered restrictions dropped on the importing of rice, ending a decades-old protectionist policy administered by the country\u2019s National Food Authority.Over the past year, vegetable prices have gone up nearly 20 percent, fish prices 12 percent and meat prices 7 percent. And while global rice prices have been stable, prices in the Philippines have been as high as double the import price.\u201cFive hundred pesos feels like one peso now,\u201d said Lilian Gomez, 52, for whom it doesn\u2019t take long these days to hit her budget limit at the Agora market in Manila. \u201cAll the prices have gone up since Duterte became president.\u201dShe said she had not bought fresh meat or fish in two months, and she reminisced about cooking dishes whose ingredients she could no longer afford: banana blossoms stewed in coconut milk, eggplant with shrimp paste, spicy taro leaves.To stretch the rice she buys for her family of three, she plumps it into porridge.Characteristically, Mr. Duterte responded to the higher prices first with threats.Publicly, he began suggesting that there was a conspiracy among rice dealers. He labeled them as cartels, hoarders and smugglers, telling them to \u201cstop messing with the people.\u201d\u201cConsider yourselves warned,\u201d he said, \u201cor the full power of the state will be upon you.\u201dEmmanuel Pinol, the agriculture secretary, backed up Mr. Duterte\u2019s threats with high-profile raids of rice warehouses, and announced a bounty of 250,000 pesos, or about $4,600, for information leading to the arrest of rice hoarders.The blame began widening, with Mr. Duterte suggesting that President Trump\u2019s trade war with China was part of the problem \u2014 as were drug addicts, who he joked had replaced their meth habits by eating huge quantities of rice, driving up prices.The National Food Authority initiated several emergency imports of rice, each time assuring the public that the intervention would drop prices, but it proved too small and too late.Experts say the country\u2019s food agency has become paralyzed by infighting among Duterte appointees. And his administration is being widely accused of mismanagement that has steadily worsened inflation and threatened to slow the economic growth that Mr. Duterte has prioritized.Ramon Clarete, a professor of economics at the University of the Philippines Diliman in Quezon City who specializes in agriculture and food policy, said the problem with rice, in particular, was a crisis of the government\u2019s own creation.\u201cIt was the incompetent mistake of the N.F.A. not stocking itself adequately that gave fuel to inflation,\u201d Mr. Clarete said of the National Food Authority, which is responsible for maintaining rice stocks and influencing prices within the Philippines\u2019 protectionist import regime. \u201cIt could be they are not appreciative enough of how the market works. Or cruel.\u201dOther factors are adding to Mr. Duterte\u2019s problems. Global oil prices are rising, making fuel more expensive. The value of the country\u2019s currency, the peso, has weakened because of broader investor concerns about global growth, driving up the price of imports.But driven to keep the country\u2019s growth revved up for years, leaders in the Philippines have contributed as well. In addition to tightly controlling rice supplies, the country has long kept interest rates low. Mr. Duterte has slashed taxes and increased infrastructure spending. All that adds to economic growth but tends to drive prices up, too.This has created immediate frustrations among the poor and the middle-class Filipinos whom Mr. Duterte has heavily courted during his time in office.The administration has lowered import taxes, and pledged to increase supplies of affordable fish and fuel \u2014 moves that the political analyst Richard Heydarian described \u201cas a reflection of a sense of desperation on the part of the government.\u201dWith Tuesday\u2019s move to drop restrictions on rice imports, Mr. Duterte has taken the biggest step yet, most likely in recognition that his political base is wavering.The urban poor are the largest voting bloc in the Philippines, and Mr. Duterte courted their votes with promises to transform their lives and bring in a wave of infrastructure improvements that would modernize the country.A new tax law that was passed to help pay for Mr. Duterte\u2019s infrastructure plan lowered income taxes for the middle and upper classes. But it increased excise and value-added taxes, pushing prices up across the board. Even as infrastructure projects stalled, continued investment in them contributed to increasing inflation, along with rising global prices for oil and a weakening currency.While Mr. Duterte\u2019s popularity has begun to drop among the poor and the middle class, according to recent polls, it has certainly not disappeared, with satisfaction ratings still topping 60 percent for his administration.But pollsters who monitor issues of national concern say economic worries now dominate lists of national concerns, with inflation at the top, followed by stagnant wages and the need for job creation.The Philippines has long been among the fastest-growing economies in Southeast Asia, and that has continued. But the rising prices have begun to have an effect. The World Bank downgraded Philippine growth prospects from 6.7 to 6.5 percent, as did Moody\u2019s, citing the negative effect of inflation.Maria Fe Villamejor-Mendoza, a professor of public policy at the University of the Philippines Diliman, said discontent could manifest in the midterm elections next May, with fewer of Mr. Duterte\u2019s allies winning seats.But in the short term, she said, \u201cthe administration is panicking and imagining scenarios to divert the attention of the people away from inflation,\u201d citing allegations of a plot by university students, public statements about Mr. Duterte\u2019s health and the resignation of a controversial government official after a series of scandals.\u201cThey underestimated the effect of inflation,\u201d Ms. Villamejor-Mendoza said, and the administration was doing \u201cdamage control, in order that people will not remember the hardship of the value of the Philippine peso.\u201dMr. Heydarian said that events like the spike in prices eroded Mr. Duterte\u2019s popularity and over time could diminish his power. As Mr. Duterte\u2019s historically high approval ratings fall to more normal levels, he may be forced to provide concessions to the old elite and other centers of power, and the opposition will be more emboldened to criticize him.\u201cThat kind of Duterte is increasingly becoming a reality,\u201d Mr. Heydarian said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge climb down from the kind of aura that he projected in his first year of office.\u201dMr. Heydarian said that while Mr. Duterte effectively distinguished himself from the political elite establishment with his vulgar and defiant style, economically he was more \u201cconventional, rather than pro-poor and progressive.\u201dThe idea resonates among people eager to see action from Mr. Duterte.Angelito Batac, a 53-year-old carpenter in Navotas, in northern Manila, said: \u201cThis started when Duterte became president. We can\u2019t breathe. He\u2019s not doing anything but curse.\u201dMr. Batac\u2019s wife, Evangeline, agreed. \u201cHe said all the poor will no longer be poor,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re even poorer.\u201dBirgit Hansl, lead economist in the Philippines for the World Bank, said some of Mr. Duterte\u2019s policies could still bear fruit. A measure adding two years to mandatory education will better prepare future generations for the work force, she said. And even some of Mr. Duterte\u2019s infrastructure projects coming to fruition would be of wide benefit, she added. However, it would still take years for the effects of those reforms to be felt.Ms. Villamejor-Mendoza, the public policy professor, said that while there may be disappointment in Mr. Duterte\u2019s unfulfilled promises, it is not turning into rage as much as disillusionment. \u201cIt\u2019s a learned hopelessness,\u201d she said.Uvigilda Condez, 47, who lives in Navotas, said she had high hopes for Mr. Duterte when he was elected. She believed him when he said he would fight for Filipinos.\u201cIt could have been great,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe we have some hope that life will become easier, but nothing has happened yet. Life seems to have gotten harder.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to be able to change,\u201d she added. \u201cHe\u2019s just like everyone else.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(The plan is said to be a backup, in case a meeting next month between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China doesn\u2019t yield results.) The tariffs could cover about $257 billion worth of goods \u2014 including popular items like iPhones and Nike sneakers.The decision, which came after the American chip maker Micron accused Jinhua of intellectual property theft, could be a crippling blow to the Chinese company. (And it drew comparisons to the Trump administration\u2019s harsh actions against ZTE earlier this year.) The penalties will delay China\u2019s effort to establish a homegrown chip industry that doesn\u2019t rely on American parts.Behind that volatility were continuing investor concerns that tech stocks are overvalued. Amazon, for instance, fell 6.3 percent yesterday, while Netflix dropped 5 percent, and shares in both are down over 20 percent this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.6 percent on Monday, and is off 13 percent from its August high.Trade fears also weighed on stocks, after a report that President Trump may impose tariffs on all remaining imports from China, raising fears about increasing costs for American businesses and consumers.U.S. markets are looking stronger this morning, however, with futures for major indexes up.In the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, social media is coming under close scrutiny.

The new charge, scheduled to go into effect in 2020, would apply only to organizations with global revenue of at least 500 million pounds, or about $640 million. The government will ask for 2 percent of revenue the companies generate in Britain. Mr. Hammond said the plan could eventually raise as much as \u00a3400 million annually.But the tech industry is unimpressed.

{"Headline": "Index Fund Investors\u2019 Simpler Approach May Enrich Returns", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeople who put their money into index funds seem to make fewer decisions than other investors. And that leads to better performance.That\u2019s the implication of a Morningstar study that helps to explain why fund investing often works better in theory than in practice. Just how much better is expressed by a measure called the return gap.That\u2019s the difference between the reported return of a fund or a group of them and the return \u2014 almost always lower \u2014 that investors achieve with real dollars in the real world.There\u2019s nothing nefarious going on; the managers aren\u2019t skimming off the top. It\u2019s just that investors have a habit of moving money into and out of funds at inopportune times, so that each dollar earns a lower rate of return than if it had been invested all the time.In an extensive study of the phenomenon, Morningstar assessed return gaps in each of six mutual fund categories for the 10 years through March: domestic diversified equity, domestic sector equity, international equity, taxable bond, balanced and alternative.Researchers found larger return gaps for actively managed portfolios than for index funds in all but one category: international equity. All told, the average annualized return gap was 2.48 percentage points for actively managed funds and 1.84 points for index funds.Either way, that\u2019s a lot of money to be eaten away from returns year in and year out.A $10,000 investment in the average index fund at the start of the study period would have grown to $20,076 a decade later, without taking the return gap into account, according to Morningstar. Factoring in the gap, the typical index investor would have been left with just $16,883.If that $10,000 had been invested in actively managed funds, it would have grown to $18,231 without considering the return gap. With the gap, the figure would have been $14,395, or barely half the gain.Morningstar calculated performance in each case by adding together the results of funds from the six investment niches in the study and weighting them based on the assets in each niche.Investment advisers credit the smaller return gap in index funds not to the funds themselves, but to their shareholders. They contend that investors who are drawn to index funds usually have psychological traits that make them less susceptible to behaviors that increase return gaps.Switching to index funds by itself is unlikely, therefore, to magically cut into the return gap you otherwise might suffer. But thinking and acting like an indexer could help reduce the gap and improve performance, they say, whatever kinds of funds you own.\u201cIndex fund investors are better behaved than active fund investors,\u201d said Christopher Cordaro, chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic, a Morristown, N.J., financial-planning firm. Two helpful characteristics that he highlighted are humility and patience.\u201cInvestors who favor index funds are likely to be more humble about their ability to time the market,\u201d Mr. Cordaro said. Trying to hit market tops and bottoms accounts for much of the return gap, in his view, because investors \u201cinvariably get the timing wrong.\u201dAs the only group for which index fund return gaps were larger, international equity may be the exception that proves the rule that the gaps generally result from poor market timing. Investors are notorious for making forays into foreign assets as a run of outperformance is nearly over. Index funds are an easy vehicle for making such tactical plays, while actively managed funds may be the preferred method for achieving overseas diversification for the long haul.Beyond recognizing how hard it is to time market turns, indexers seem to display humility by keeping their goals modest. The smaller return gap, in part, \u201ccan be attributed to the expectations investors have on Day 1,\u201d said Ben Johnson, the director of passive studies for Morningstar.Indexers know \u201cthey will participate in the performance of the market come hell or high water,\u201d he said. \u201cThat allows them to better manage their own behavior.\u201dStock and bond market performance was close to heavenly for almost the entire period of the return gap study. Some question, though, how well index funds will do in a protracted bear market and whether shareholders will stick with them as faithfully as they did when prices nearly always went up.\u201cThe results would be logical and widely expected, but are they reflective of a full market cycle? Probably not,\u201d said James Stack, chief executive of Stack Financial Management.For active managers, \u201csector allocation and stock selection are used to reduce the inherent risk in a portfolio,\u201d he said. \u201cThat tends to work against active management in a prolonged bull market, but it works to their advantage in a bear market. Passive funds often look stellar after the end of a very-long-running bull market, but they often will lose more than actively managed funds in a bear market.\u201dActive managers can raise cash or move into more defensive holdings \u2014 utility or consumer staples stocks, higher-quality bonds \u2014 when market action turns ugly, while index vehicles are stuck being fully invested in the same portfolio. Given the knowledge that no one is at the controls, would owners of index funds still calmly hold on, or would they engage in the same behaviors that cause return gaps, creating gaps that are as big as, or perhaps bigger than, those for active funds?Mr. Stack, who publishes investment advisory newsletters under the InvesTech Research brand, said a combination of worse returns and a tendency of shareholders to hold on longer could raise return gaps for index funds during extended market weakness.Mr. Johnson is skeptical about that, mainly because he doubts the ability of active managers to be all that active in a helpful way during a decline.\u201cPeople tend to overlook the performance of active funds in a bear market,\u201d he said. \u201cFew are able to get out of the way. In any bear market, investors are going to get skittish in active or index funds.\u201dPerhaps you\u2019re already a patient and humble investor (if you do say so yourself) and can avoid the sorts of mistakes that intensify return gaps. So much the better, but even if you\u2019re not and are unlikely to change, you may have no choice but to behave more productively if you invest through your employer\u2019s retirement plan.The one category for which the return gap was positive in the Morningstar study, albeit by a thin 0.18 percentage points a year, was balanced index funds, which allocate assets between stocks and bonds. Mr. Johnson noted that these funds were likely to be owned through employer plans, many of which have safeguards to protect investors.\u201cThe gap has been positive because, within those funds, we have seen money coming in at regular intervals,\u201d he said. Penalties for early withdrawals are another impediment to plan participants making timing calls.Regular contributions to retirement plans also compel investors to engage in dollar-cost averaging, said Peggy Ruhlin, chief executive of Budros, Ruhlin & Roe, a Columbus, Ohio, financial-planning firm. A practice universally regarded as a safe way to invest long term, dollar-cost averaging involves salting away the same dollar amount each period, ensuring that more assets are bought when prices are lower.\u201cA 401(k) plan is the best way to dollar-cost-average,\u201d she said. But, she added: \u201cYou should follow the same path with money that\u2019s not in a 401(k).\u201dMs. Ruhlin, like most advisers, also tells investors to diversify among different asset classes: stocks and bonds, foreign and domestic. When deciding on an appropriate mix, they should consider not just market-related factors, their age and personal financial circumstances, she said, but emotional and psychological factors, too.\u201cIf you\u2019re an investor who panics about everything, you should not have an allocation that\u2019s 90 percent stocks,\u201d Ms. Ruhlin said. \u201cTake into account your own preferences and have an appropriate balance.\u201dDiversification helps cut the return gap by smoothing out performance, Mr. Cordaro said. That lower volatility limits the chance that purchases or sales will be made at an especially bad time by reducing any sense of urgency to buy or sell, and it reduces the consequences, even if an investor can\u2019t resist.He also recommends regular portfolio rebalancing: lightening up on funds that have risen substantially and buying more of what has declined.\u201cIt\u2019s a disciplined way of buying low and selling high,\u201d Mr. Cordaro said. \u201cThe return gap exists because most investors do the opposite.\u201dPerhaps the best approach to your investments is to approach them less.\u201cFind yourself a hobby that isn\u2019t checking your portfolio,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cThe more often you look at what\u2019s going on in the market and how it\u2019s affecting your investments day to day, the more tempted you\u2019ll be to tinker.

{"Headline": "Eurozone Growth Slips to Four-Year Low, Fueling Crisis Fears", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Economic growth in the eurozone has fallen to its slowest pace in more than four years, and Italy is not growing at all, according to figures released Tuesday. The snapshot is likely to sharpen political divisions in the European Union and make the region more vulnerable to the forces rattling financial markets.Both numbers were unexpectedly poor. Eurozone growth in the quarter was only half as fast as it had been in the previous three-month period, and the rate of growth has fallen each of the last three quarters.One of the European Commission\u2019s criticisms of the Italian budget is that it was based on overly optimistic estimates of future economic growth. Now those estimates look even less realistic.Investors registered their disappointment by bidding up the market interest rate on Italian government bonds on Tuesday. That will only amplify the country\u2019s problems.The rates on government bonds serve as benchmarks for the rates that Italians pay on business or consumer loans. Higher rates will squeeze spending and lead to yet slower growth.\u201cIt\u2019s a self-defeating cycle,\u201d said Lorenzo Codogno, chief economist at LC Macro Advisors in London. \u201cThe government is shooting itself in the foot.\u201dBut Mr. Codogno said he doubted that the populist parties governing Italy would retreat from their campaign promises, such as increases in pensions. To do so, he said, \u201cwould be political suicide.\u201dAnd Italy is not the only country in the eurozone facing political instability.The eurozone growth figure published Tuesday was a first estimate and contained no detail about what sectors led to the slowdown. Still, the causes are obvious enough.They include the prospect that Britain\u2019s separation from the European Union will be disruptive; a trade war with the United States that has interfered with trans-Atlantic commerce; and rising interest rates as central banks roll back the stimulus programs they used to combat the last financial crisis.Those risks are accumulating at the same time that financial markets are unusually nervous. Daily fluctuations in the prices of stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities like gold and copper are at their most extreme levels since 2008, when the last global financial crisis began, according to data compiled by analysts at the German bank Berenberg.The one somewhat bright spot in the numbers Tuesday was France, which registered growth of 0.4 percent from the previous quarter. But, coming after two weaker quarters, even that above-average result was not enough to achieve the 1.7 percent pace of expansion that economist say President Emmanuel Macron needs to validate his program of business-friendly reforms.The disappointing growth in the eurozone as a whole was partly caused by factors that aren\u2019t likely to repeat, leaving room for hope that growth will pick up toward the end of the year.For example, European car sales slumped 24 percent in September as auto manufacturers struggled to comply with new, stricter emissions standards. Cars were slow to reach dealers because of delays in getting regulators to certify vehicles for sale. Manufacturers such as BMW and Daimler have also been caught in the crossfire of President Trump\u2019s trade war with China.The slowdown in the car industry rippled through the eurozone and was probably most pronounced in Germany, the Continent\u2019s largest economy and motor of growth. Registrations of new Volkswagens slumped by nearly half in September, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The company at least temporarily lost its long-held status as the Continent\u2019s largest auto manufacturer to PSA of France, the maker of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn cars.The brake on growth caused by the auto industry should dissipate soon, \u201cand the euro economy is likely to grow more strongly again,\u201d Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients Tuesday.Bernd Meyer, chief strategist for wealth and asset management at Berenberg, pointed out that prices for tech stocks or real estate were not at the extreme levels that preceded past meltdowns.During a meeting with reporters Tuesday, Mr. Meyer argued that market pressure on Italy will eventually force the government to relent on its spending plans. But, he added, \u201cthey will only back down when they are staring into the abyss.\u201d\u201cRecent surveys,\u201d Mr. Nobile said in a note to clients, \u201care painting a rather bleak picture of eurozone growth.\u201dLiz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Created \u2018The Bernank\u2019 on YouTube. And I Was Mostly Wrong.", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewIn November 2010, as the Federal Reserve embarked on its second round of bond buying, Omid Malekan uploaded to YouTube a cartoon called \u201cQuantitative Easing Explained,\u201d which was critical of the central bank\u2019s response to the financial crisis. Within weeks, millions of people had viewed it. Here, nearly eight years later, he says that he got it largely wrong.It has been 10 years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers marked the unofficial start of the financial crisis. For those of us in finance who lived through that period, and the countless others affected by it, it remains hard to think of it as just a moment in history. A decade removed, the experience feels more like a mass injury that \u2014 grateful as we are to have survived \u2014 still lingers, and often manifests itself in the ongoing controversy over the government\u2019s response.I am a small part of that controversy, thanks to a YouTube cartoon I published in 2010 criticizing the Federal Reserve\u2019s bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing. The popularity of that cartoon surprised me. Like most things that go viral, it was more a testament to what was on people\u2019s minds than the quality of the work. Nevertheless, terms used in the cartoon like \u201cThe Bernank\u201d entered the economic zeitgeist, resonating with people who knew that they didn\u2019t like what was happening but lacked the technical vocabulary to express why.Most of the targets of my cartoon, including Ben Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, have defended their actions and maintained that their work was effective in keeping the economic harm from worsening. I\u2019m inclined to agree. Quantitative easing worked, just not in the way it was intended. Before I explain why, I need to admit what I got wrong.Contrary to what one of my cartoon characters predicted, Q.E. didn\u2019t \u201cblow up the global economy.\u201d Instead, both economic growth and the financial markets have been remarkably steady. If anything, the expansion of central bank balance sheets has dampened volatility. It\u2019s still possible that the reversal of those policies will have a destabilizing effect, but even if that does happen \u2014 and I hope it doesn\u2019t \u2014 I was still way off the mark.The current economic expansion is one of the longest in history, and that too has surprised me. If you had asked me to predict the odds of another major recession eight years ago, not only would I have called it likely, I probably would have added that the very policies used to deal with the 2008 financial crisis would cause it. I was wrong about that, too.Ironically, those mechanics are something that Mr. Bernanke and I have always agreed on. He has often defended his actions by arguing that Q.E. is not the same as printing money because it only affects reserves in the banking system. Leaving aside the obvious overlap between the two concepts, I believe he\u2019s right. Q.E. was, first and foremost, a policy designed to enrich banks. In that sense, it worked remarkably, and tragically, well.Who does benefit? All the parties that have done disproportionately well in the past decade, like investment funds, large corporations and the wealthy. Debt levels have exploded among those groups, as have the valuations of the assets they tend to own: private companies, premium real estate and stocks. For this, I give Mr. Bernanke credit. History turned out almost as he predicted in his op-ed:\u201cLower corporate bond rates will encourage investment. And higher stock prices will boost consumer wealth and help increase confidence, which can also spur spending. Increased spending will lead to higher incomes and profits that, in a virtuous circle, will further support economic expansion.\u201dAccording to government data, almost a fifth of the United States population is either \u201cunderbanked\u201d or entirely disconnected from the financial system \u2014 a percentage that grew after the 2008 crisis. These are the people who have suffered the most in the past decade. Their existence outside the banking system almost guaranteed that they would not benefit from policies like lower interest rates.Quantitative easing worked, but not for those who needed it most.There was one other thing that I got wrong about the government\u2019s response to the financial crisis. I assumed that the effects, and side-effects, would be felt in the economic realm. But today, it\u2019s the political, social and even technological consequences that stand out.The growing wealth gap, which we now understand to be at least partially caused by such policies, has fueled many political and social movements. In this era of political polarization, the one belief that the far left and the far right increasingly share is that our economic system is somehow rigged. That perception has played a part in everything from the insurgent campaign of Bernie Sanders to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory.Most surprising of all, though, is that there is now a new kind of money \u2014 one borne out of the chaos of the financial crisis and the controversial policies enacted thereafter.Bitcoin and other digital currencies are the technological solution to a legacy monetary system that increasingly looks unfair. The decentralized nature and radical transparency of cryptocurrencies are a response to a banking system where institutions that were \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d have been enriched by Q.E. The code that underpins the Bitcoin blockchain is designed to treat the poorest citizen exactly the same way as the most powerful banker. After everything that\u2019s happened in the past decade, we can no longer say the same thing about the Fed.I disagree with some of my colleagues in the so-called cryptosphere on the potential for such coins to ever fully replace fiat money. But I am a proponent for many reasons, including the lifeboat they offer from poorly conceived economic policy. Despite the enduring controversy of the policies enacted in response to the financial crisis, their architects promise to repeat them in the future. But next time, those of us who are adversely impacted by such policies, or just morally opposed to them, won\u2019t have to stand idly by. Next time, we can take our money elsewhere.Omid Malekan is the author of \u201cThe Story of the Blockchain, a Beginner\u2019s Guide to the Technology Nobody Understands.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time to Talk About the N.R.A.", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "\nThe massacre of 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue a week ago was terrifyingly predictable \u2014 with an equally predictable response. President Trump and members of Congress denounced the violence but show no signs of actually doing anything.Why is it that polls show that voters want more gun safety laws yet Congress can\u2019t pass any? One reason is the National Rifle Association, a heavyweight player in this election and every election. On Tuesday, the N.R.A. once again will help deflect what surveys suggest is the people\u2019s will to stop it.I write this as a former N.R.A. member who grew up on a farm \u2014 my 12th birthday present was my own .22 rifle \u2014 and I acknowledge that it once was a great organization for shooting enthusiasts.But it has been hijacked by extremist leaders committed not to their members\u2019 (much more reasonable) views, but to hard-line resistance of safety regulations. All countries have violent, hateful people, but only in America do we give them ready access to assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, and that\u2019s in part because of the N.R.A. and its political influence.The Second Amendment? Few talked about it. Almost everyone, in and out of the N.R.A., accepted that there should be restrictions on firearms.Visitors to Wichita, Kan., had to check their revolvers at police headquarters. And as for Dodge City, a symbol of the Wild West, a photo shows a sign on main street in 1879 warning: \u201cThe Carrying of Fire Arms Strictly Prohibited.\u201dIn the 1920s and 1930s, the N.R.A. favored tighter gun laws, and its president, Karl Frederick, said that the carrying of weapons \u201cshould be sharply restricted and only under license.\u201d In 1934, the United States helped pioneer modern gun laws with the National Firearms Act, with the blessings of the N.R.A., and came close to banning handguns. As recently as the 1960s, the N.R.A. supported \u2014 more grudgingly \u2014 some limits on guns.But in 1977 there was a coup within the N.R.A. that put hard-liners in charge. The group began calling for repeal of the 1968 Gun Control Act and doubled down on a full-time lobbying arm to oppose firearm restrictions. In effect, the group took an extremist turn that continues to shape American life today.America\u2019s gun culture and Canada\u2019s had been similar in the 1950s and 60s, focused on rifles used for hunting. In 1959, a survey found that 60 percent of Americans favored a ban on handguns. Then in the post-World War II period, other countries steadily tightened gun laws, while in the United States the N.R.A. moved to emphasize handguns and personal security, building on public anxiety about crime, so the United States resisted that global trend and instead passed a series of concealed carry laws.Leaders of the N.R.A. fervently backed a new movement to reinterpret the Second Amendment, which had been regarded as a relic having to do with state militias, as protecting individual gun rights. In 1991, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger, a conservative, dismissed calls to reinterpret the Second Amendment as \u201cone of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word \u2018fraud,\u2019 on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.\u201dNow that \u201cfraud\u201d is the law of the land.The reinterpretation of the Second Amendment is a tribute to the undeniable effectiveness of the N.R.A. Relentless campaigning by the N.R.A. and changing American mores have resulted in a Constitutional right to bear arms, in a blizzard of concealed carry permits, and in tough stand-your-ground laws. In contrast to Canada, the United States now has a gun culture focused on handguns, assault weapons and paranoia, and that\u2019s in large part because of the N.R.A.Even now, the N.R.A.\u2019s strategy is largely to pounce on liberal comments about \u201cgun control\u201d \u2014 one reason I prefer the less threatening term \u201cgun safety\u201d \u2014 and leverage them to frighten gun owners to become more engaged. On one of the N.R.A.\u2019s websites the other day was a headline, \u201cD.C.

It is a mature business whose products last generations, and whose traditional constituency \u2014 hunters \u2014 is aging and shrinking, and it is also facing the kind of liability risks that struck the tobacco industry. Yet in fact, the gun industry has prospered in recent decades \u2014 in large part because it has been rescued by N.R.A. fear-mongering that drives gun owners to buy more weapons and accessories before they\u2019re banned. This is brilliant marketing.Consider another of the N.R.A.\u2019s current campaigns, to allow silencers. Silencers have been largely banned since the 1930s, but the N.R.A. and enthusiasts like Donald Trump Jr. argue that they should be allowed as a matter of liberty and for health reasons \u2014 to reduce hearing loss associated with gunfire.No one takes this public health argument seriously, but allowing silencers would be a huge boon for the gun industry. If five million Americans each bought a silencer for two firearms, it could amount to $1 billion in sales.Moreover, most firearms today don\u2019t have the threaded barrels needed to accommodate a silencer. So a gun owner who wanted both a rifle and a handgun with silencers would also buy two more firearms \u2014 a further benefit to the industry.Companies show gratitude in other ways. A laser sight maker called Crimson Trace donates 10 percent of certain sales to the organization, and other companies have similar initiatives.The N.R.A. has been admired and feared for decades for its political influence. When Al Gore lost the presidency in 2000, it was widely said that the N.R.A. made the difference.Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia says that the N.R.A.\u2019s power is often attributed to its financial support for candidates, but that its endorsements are far more important. The key, he says, is that many gun rights supporters are single-issue voters, while historically those against the N.R.A. have also cared about the economy, civil rights, foreign policy and so on.Yet there are signs that this is changing, and that N.R.A. influence may have peaked.Even N.R.A. members want some curbs on gunsSolid majorities of N.R.A. members supported these restrictions.Requiring gun retailers to perform background checks on employees to ensure they are not felons79% of NRA members agreeRequiring a criminal background check on anyone purchasing a gun74Prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns71Requiring gun owners to alert police if their guns are lost or stolen64Concealed carry permits should only be granted to applicants \u2026\u2026 who have not committed any violent misdemeanors, such as assault75\u2026 who have completed gun safety training74\u2026 who do not have prior arrests for domestic violence6865\u2026 21 years old or olderSources: poll by Luntz Global, 2012; Mayors Against Illegal GunsEven N.R.A. members want some curbs on gunsSolid majorities of N.R.A. members supported these restrictions.79% of NRA members agreeRequiring gun retailers to perform background checks on employees to ensure they are not felonsRequiring a criminal background check on anyone purchasing a gun74Prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns71Requiring gun owners to alert police if their guns are lost or stolen64Concealed carry permits should only be granted to applicants \u2026\u2026 who have not committed any violent misdemeanors, such as assault75\u2026 who have completed gun safety training74\u2026 who do not have prior arrests for domestic violence68\u2026 21 years old or older65Sources: poll by Luntz Global, 2012; Mayors Against Illegal GunsViews of the N.R.A.have been mostly positivefavorable6058555351Overall it has been positive since Gallup began tracking it \u2014 except in June 1995, two months after the Oklahoma City terror attack and one month after former president George H.W.

But today they remain legal around the country, and the public has moved on. This underscores the N.R.A.\u2019s success at blocking national regulations, but also the degree to which it is vulnerable for being out of step with public opinion.Even critics of the N.R.A. acknowledge that it also performs a significant public service that liberals rarely acknowledge: It runs gun safety classes around the country.Every year, the N.R.A. trains some 750,000 Americans in gun safety. Sometimes these classes have an ideological tinge, and they often encourage joining the N.R.A. and fighting for Second Amendment rights, but they also train new gun buyers to use a gun reasonably safely.It would be good to see progressive organizations teaching gun safety as well, rather than simply ceding the turf to the N.R.A.My first encounter with the N.R.A. was in a hunter safety class in my hometown of Yamhill, Ore., when I was in seventh grade. At the end of the class, we all received a one-year N.R.A. membership.At the time it was simply a grass-roots organization of hunters and well-meaning sportsmen. But along the way, it morphed into an extremist organization that fights any restrictions on firearms.More guns = more child deathsA comparison of child deaths in the 15 states with the highest household gun ownership and the six states with the lowest.

Fink, and Blackstone Group\u2019s chief, Stephen Schwarzman, said two people familiar with the conversations. All three depend on the kingdom for revenue.Mr. Dimon, Mr. Fink and Mr. Schwarzman pressed Saudi officials to postpone the event, the two people said. The three executives and their staffs reached out to the Treasury Department and urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to press for the event to be postponed or to publicly make his attendance conditional on more disclosure from the Saudis about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.Mr. Dimon\u2019s decision follows those of Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber, Bill Ford of Ford Motor and other C.E.O.s. At issue: the disappearance and possible murder of the Saudi exile Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul. Saudi officials deny any involvement.Alongside the bankruptcy filing, Mr. Lampert stepped down as Sears\u2019s C.E.O. but will remain chairman.

As Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute told the NYT: \u201cWe\u2019ve finessed the public relations problem. But we aren\u2019t really competing with the Chinese.\u201dDiscussion about Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union hit an impasse last night. Dominic Raab, the country\u2019s Brexit secretary, told his European counterpart, Michel Barnier, that his government could not agree to the bloc\u2019s current terms, with Prime Minister Theresa May having called a draft a \u201cnonstarter.\u201dE.U. leaders may conclude there is not sufficient progress to justify proceeding to a special Brexit summit in November to seal a deal, leaving talks in limbo and Britain heading towards an economically damaging \u201cno deal\u201d exit next March.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!
