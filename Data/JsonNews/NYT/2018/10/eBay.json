{"Headline": "With Change Bubbling, San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown Strives to Stay Authentic", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySquare FeetIn San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown, where tradition is sharing space with modernity \u2014 think duck fat-infused cocktails alongside oolong tea \u2014 the community finds itself at a crossroads: trying to fend off gentrification while welcoming change.As leases run out and merchants retire, entrepreneurs are opening upscale restaurants and shops, while aging enterprises strive to remain relevant. The restaurant Eight Tables, which opened last October, offers a $225 tasting menu featuring a caviar dumpling, and the popular Golden Gate Fortune Cookies tempts changing taste buds with matcha and chocolate-dipped treats.This struggle to adapt is felt in other Chinatowns across the nation as heritage enterprises and new ventures work to maintain their cultural authenticity.In Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown, the population of Chinese inhabitants has dropped well below 40 percent, according to research by Tarry Hum, a professor and acting chairwoman of the urban studies department at Queens College.With luxury housing developments in the works, including a $1.4 billion, 815-unit tower, the district is \u201cneck deep\u201d in gentrification and facing \u201chyper-development,\u201d said Tomie Arai, an activist and a co-founder of the Chinatown Art Brigade. She added that the area now had more than 100 art galleries, which have displaced mom-and-pop businesses.\u201cYou can picture how devastating this development is on the lives of the people who live there,\u201d Ms. Arai said. \u201cAn increasingly white population is threatening to replace the cultural identity of the neighborhood.\u201dDespite these challenges, civic improvements are helping enhance the neighborhood, including mural art, cleaner alleys and better affordable housing. A much-anticipated Chinatown Station subway hub is expected to open in 2019. Recently enacted laws curb short-term vacation rentals, keeping out companies like Airbnb and VRBO, and a legacy business program offers financial incentives to landlords who sign long-term commercial leases with qualifying Chinatown enterprises.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the determination of the community and a seat at City Hall, Chinatown would have been long gone by now,\u201d said Aaron Peskin, a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors representing Chinatown. When changes are done right, neighborhoods can be upgraded without displacing longtime residents, he added.In addition, proponents believe the enclave of 900 family-owned businesses is shifting in the right direction. But change happens slowly.By next year, at least two Chinese-owned cocktail bars and two Chinese restaurants will open. A performance venue, the Clarion Music Performing Arts Center, recently presented \u201cSparring With Beatnik Ghosts,\u201d a poetry night that included Chinese rap.People complain that old shops are closing, but evolution is good, said Betty Louie, a prominent Chinatown landlord whose family has owned property there since the 1940s. \u201cSome think we should remain a ghetto, but people are coming in and trying to do something different, and that is cool,\u201d she said.Notable chefs in Chinatown are garnering rave reviews, turning the zone into a culinary hot spot.\u201cIt was a challenge and a responsibility,\u201d he said. \u201cI draw my strength from the amazing Chinese restaurants before me like Four Seas and Kan\u2019s. I want to be a part of that Chinatown legacy.\u201dAt the same time, retail is becoming more sophisticated. It took three years for Mr. Chen\u2019s wife, Cynthia Wong-Chen, to curate her shop at China Live. Merchandise includes house sauces, portable tea sets in zippered cases and handmade paring knives presented atop reclaimed elm tables.Another entrepreneur, Tiffany Tam, gleaned business savvy from working at her parents\u2019 Chinatown souvenir stores. In April, she and her sister, Renee, opened Kim + Ono, a boutique on Grant Avenue that focuses on hand-painted Chinese kimonos designed in San Francisco. There\u2019s couch seating, a few clothing racks with space to browse and jewelry from local artisans. Of note is a floor-to-ceiling floral mural.\u201cIn this generation, you really have to strive to have something different than everyone else and create an experience for your customers,\u201d Ms. Tam said.But Chinatown\u2019s advocates are concerned. The area is filled with too many voices that seem unable to agree, said Sue Lee, Chinatown historian and former head of the Chinese Historical Society of America.\u201cThere is no uniform strategy for improvement to move forward together,\u201d Ms. Lee said, calling the new restaurants and retail shops \u201cone-offs.\u201d\u201cThere is very little culture left in terms of Chinese movies and opera, but it has to survive,\u201d she said.Founded in the mid-1800s, Chinatown was notorious for opium dens, gambling houses and brothels. After the 1906 earthquake, the city threatened to move Chinatown to undesirable outskirts, so leaders in the Chinese community hatched a plan to transform Chinatown into a tourist attraction so it could survive.Another reason the cultural hub stays intact is the wealth of nonprofit organizations and social service agencies looking out for Chinatown\u2019s interests. The influential Chinatown Community Development Center has been advocating affordable housing and grooming youth for civic leadership for more than 40 years.Within Chinatown are 200 distinct family and district associations, which are much more than social clubs \u2014 they are strong voting blocs. In the 1800s, new immigrants made a beeline to their family associations to secure housing and employment. The largest is the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, with some 2,000 members.For decades, Chinese residents were prohibited from buying property, so associations incorporated and bought real estate in Chinatown. Today, the majority of the buildings are owned by Chinese associations, partnerships and individuals, Ms. Louie said. Association leaders discuss rental issues, scholarships to award and charities to fund.\u201cThe associations do incredible things,\u201d Mr. Peskin said. \u201cTheir saving grace is that they are all profoundly interested in the continuity of the community.\u201dAssociations uphold traditions, but they cannot prevent retirement and real estate vacancies.Eddie Au, owner of Man Hing Ivory & Imports for 50 years, is praying someone will buy his antiquities store. What was once a 1,500-square-foot storefront with ivory, bone and jade carvings now occupies 600 square feet.\u201cIt takes five years to carve a bone or a stone. These are handcrafts that people have had to learn,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this generation does not care for things like this.\u201d He does not expect his grown children to take over and has begun selling his inventory on eBay.A few members of the younger generation, however, are keeping the flame alive. Some do it out of duty, others for a fun challenge.Kevin Chan, for one, has worked at Golden Gate Fortune Cookies, owned by his mother, Nancy Tom Chan, since he was 9. Ms. Chan created the secret recipe and has been mixing the batter daily since 1962.\u201cI\u2019m not rich,\u201d Mr. Chan said. \u201cI am giving back to Chinatown and the city of San Francisco. I\u2019ll be here until I die.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Today, it says 89 percent of goods bought on eBay are at a fixed price \u2014 making it more of a direct competitor with Amazon and adding to concern that its rival was trying to poach top sellers.Amazon is adding to the breadth and depth of the products on its website by attracting third-party merchants. That lets Amazon tie up less of its resources in holding inventory waiting to be sold, but it also places extra pressure on the company to attract sellers that offer the merchandise that it believes customers want.Amazon charges for various services, such as selling, distribution and advertising. Last year, for the first time, more than half of the units sold on its website were from third-party sellers.While some sellers list on both Amazon and eBay, as well as other sites, others opt to pick a primary marketplace.

{"Headline": "Restoring the House the Ringling Circus Built", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt was a showplace that they filled with treasures purchased around the world, including 400 objects from a mansion in Newport, R.I., that were sold when Alva Vanderbilt divorced William Vanderbilt.As a member of the museum\u2019s staff, and later the curator of Ca\u2019 d\u2019Zan, Ron McCarty observed the decline with dismay. But Mr. McCarty, who retired this year, played a crucial role in not only restoring the house, but also in bringing back memorabilia from when the Ringlings lived there.His work underscores the challenges in maintaining historical properties. Having been closed for a decade, starting in 1936, Ca\u2019 d\u2019Zan had suffered from decay. Mold and mildew had grown on the walls, and the furniture fabrics had deteriorated.Mr. McCarty\u2019s role gave him an unusual opportunity to delve deeply into family history. The Ringlings\u2019 relatives, former business associates and employees could provide tales and objects.Over the decades, Mr. McCarty has remained fascinated by the family. John Ringling and his brothers made the circus the centerpiece of American entertainment, but at \u201cthe center of it all is the great love story of the Ringlings,\u201d Mr. McCarty said in an interview shortly before he retired.Steven High, executive director of the Ringling, praised Mr. McCarty\u2019s work. \u201cDuring his frequent public presentations, his knowledge and passion has kept their spirit alive,\u201d Mr. High said.For decades Mr. McCarty, part historian and part sleuth, pursued objects that told the Ringlings\u2019 story. Daily, over 20 years, he said he logged on to eBay, where he found troves of photographs. He even found a 1927 issue of Country Life that described how the house looked when it first opened.If Mable Ringling\u2019s closets were empty when Mr. McCarty took over, they are not now. Family members have given him over 50 pieces, from a hat box with Mable\u2019s name on it to a black crepe beaded gown with sequins from French & Company that cost $1,800 in 1923.When Mrs. Ringling died, her clothes were dispersed among family members. \u201cMy sisters remember playing with them when they were little girls,\u201d recalled Chris Schueler, the grandson of Mable\u2019s sister Dulcy Burton.\u201cThe family had considered giving them back to the Ringling,\u201d Mr. Schueler explained. \u201cThen, about three years ago, we met Ron and fell in love with him.\u201d Still, he said, \u201cIt was funny to see the curators using white gloves to handle all those things that my sisters had played with as children.\u201dSometimes discoveries were the result of going through the Ringlings\u2019 bureaus. All their drawers had been locked since John Ringling\u2019s death in 1936, probably because he kept them that way. By the 1990s, the keys had disappeared.\u201cWe got a locksmith to open the bureau, and we found all John Ringling\u2019s Charvet ties lying in rows,\u201d Mr. McCarty said. \u201cIt was spectacular,\u201d he added, using a favorite term.Much of Ca\u2019 D\u2019Zan was the product of Mrs. Ringling\u2019s passion for architecture and decoration. \u201cThe house was really her creation,\u201d Mr. McCarty said.Both John and Mable came from large families and meager origins. But by their 1905 wedding, John Ringling was already rich enough to have commissioned a 79-foot Pullman train car. \u201cThat was like having your own private jet today,\u201d Mr. McCarty explained.Visits to friends in Sarasota persuaded the Ringlings to buy a home on the bay. But it was not until 1924, after they had traveled extensively in Europe, that they began building Ca\u2019 d\u2019Zan. Italy was their shared infatuation. \u201cThe house was inspired by Ca\u2019 d\u2019Oro, the doge\u2019s palace in Venice,\u201d Mr. McCarty said.World-class shoppers who loved nothing so much as furniture that had once been owned by the elite, the Ringlings filled their home with objects from estate sales.For Mr. McCarty, who became the official curator in 2000, helping to restore the house\u2019s glamour has been an exhilarating, if exhausting, labor of love.He had come to Ca\u2019 d\u2019Zan well trained for the work. \u201cI grew up in Kansas City, and I wanted to be a painter,\u201d he recalled. But lured by a steady salary from the Ringling, Mr. McCarty jumped when, in 1980, he was offered a job as a registrar of the historical records at the museum complex.Among his tasks was to serve as a courier for the museum\u2019s works of art that were lent for exhibitions around the world. On one cargo trip from Japan to the United States, he recalled, \u201cI was traveling with works of art on the same plane with racehorses, exotic snakes and very expensive racecars.\u201dBy the mid-1990s, Mr. McCarty had begun working on his gargantuan restoration project. One year was dedicated solely to the asbestos problem. Each object had to be moved out and cleaned.In many cases, Mr. McCarty said, the fabrics had to be replaced. For example, the original material on the four Louis XIV throne chairs was hand-loomed Genovese velvet. \u201cIt could have been duplicated by Scalamandre,\u201d Mr. McCarty said. \u201cBut we would have had to wait two years, and the cost would have been $82,000 a chair.\u201d Instead, Mr. McCarty tapped into an extensive network of experienced curators for a less expensive alternative.That was hardly the end of the work. Mr. McCarty had overseen the restoration of the gatehouse and the repair of damage from hurricanes. But despite the challenges, he said he enjoyed the job.\u201cEvery day was exciting because it was bringing the house back to life and filling it with objects the Ringlings actually had,\u201d he said. \u201cEven for historic houses, that is quite rare.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "William Helfand, a Collector Intrigued by Quackery, Dies at 92", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWilliam H. Helfand, whose vast collection of prints, posters and similar memorabilia documented the peddling of spurious pills, potions and other medical treatments across the centuries in the United States and beyond, died on Tuesday in Branford, Conn. He was 92.His daughter Jessica Helfand said the cause was congestive heart failure.He became something of an expert on the history of quackery and the methods of promoting it.\u201cIt\u2019s probably the second-oldest profession,\u201d he said in a 2014 talk at the Institute Library in New Haven. \u201cIt was one of the easiest things to get into, because all you had to do was say \u2018My product cures some serious disease,\u2019 and you did not have to back it up.\u201dBecoming a connoisseur of such oddities also made Mr. Helfand a connoisseur of certain types of art, since, especially as lithography and other printing methods advanced in the 19th and 20th centuries, artists like Franz von Stuck and Louis Raemaekers created posters on medical themes.The exhibitions created from his collection were both full of quirky surprises and compelling for their overarching resonance.\u201cJust tell me what to do, they say. Give me something that will work. No doctor today can do either one, not without a lot of disclaimers, but that doesn\u2019t mean anyone has stopped asking.\u201dWilliam Hirsh Helfand was born on May 21, 1926, in Philadelphia. His father, Leopold, was a pharmacist, and his mother, Minnie (Reed) Helfand, was an occasional pianist who sometimes accompanied the opera singer Marian Anderson.After two years in the Army, Mr. Helfand graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1948 with a degree in chemical engineering, then earned a degree in pharmacy at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Science in 1952. He worked for a time in his father\u2019s Philadelphia drugstore, Helfand & Katz. While working toward that degree, he took a side class in art at the Barnes Foundation in Philadelphia, just to fill in a gap in his knowledge.In 1955 or 1956, he said, an etching he noticed in a British catalog gave focus to his collecting aspirations.By that time he was working in the marketing division of the pharmaceutical company Merck; he eventually worked his way up to senior vice president of the international division. Merck sent him on numerous trips, which gave him a chance to indulge his growing passion for collecting.\u201cWhenever I would go somewhere, I would try to find at least one day for myself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always possible, but if it was, I would go to see the dealers, or go to places where there might be prints available.\u201dHis daughter said her father\u2019s collecting had made for a visually interesting household wherever his job took the family.\u201cI grew up with my sister in a house full of prints and posters and ephemera about pharmacy and medicine,\u201d Ms. Helfand, an artist, designer and writer who teaches at Yale, said by email. \u201cFrom Philadelphia to Princeton to Paris, that collection grew and grew, following us everywhere. Long before eBay, before \u2018collectible\u2019 was a descriptor of any kind, he saw the value in these things as keen ambassadors of a kind of social history.\u201dMr. Helfand had dealers he bought from regularly, but he also enjoyed searching off the beaten path.\u201cYou walk in strange places and you find strange things,\u201d he said.Mr. Helfand often said that for much of the period covered by his collection, legitimate doctors were about as likely to do someone harm as quacks were with their bogus cures; only in the latter 1800s did real medical science begin to evolve. And, he noted, some of what seems like duplicity today may have been more a matter of ignorance.\u201cWe cannot always be sure of the motivation of the seller,\u201d he told The Times in 2011. \u201cIt may be quackery to us, but he or she may have thought it could cure everything.\u201dWhatever the motive, getting noticed was the key, and the colorful, sometimes garish posters and such were in that sense part of the birth of modern advertising.\u201cThey\u2019ve got to have a catchy way to grab your attention,\u201d Mr. Helfand told a reporter for The Gloucester County Times in 2011, pointing to a large poster in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. \u201cThat one over there is advertising Vin Mariani, a popular French tonic wine. Why would you look at it? Well, it has a pretty girl on it, it\u2019s colorful and it\u2019s a French product written in English.\u201dWould that be enough to make someone buy it?\u201cYou\u2019d be very happy you did,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause it contained cocaine.\u201dMr. Helfand married Audrey Real in 1954. She died in 2002. In addition to his daughter Jessica, he is survived by another daughter, Rachel Frankel; a sister, Joan Lusen; and four grandchildren.Mr. Helfand wrote several books on his unusual hobby, including \u201cQuack, Quack, Quack: The Sellers of Nostrums in Prints, Posters, Ephemera and Books,\u201d which accompanied a 2005 exhibition of the same name at the Philadelphia museum.\u201cHis enthusiasm for it was \u2014 to use a word that would have made him chuckle \u2014 infectious,\u201d Mr. Rub said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf being transfixed by paintings is your idea of a good time, treat yourself. Go see the funny, radiant, sexy, quasi-abstractions of Stephen Mueller (1947-2011). Consistently mesmerizing in their extravagant colors and surprising contrasts of shape and background, they deserve to be better known. This exhibition of more than 40 paintings, watercolors and notebooks is the largest yet devoted to his work.Artists of Mr. Mueller\u2019s generation often strove to undermine or subvert Color Field Painting, which he did by adding thick flourishes of paint to canvases delicately stained with color. In two paintings from 1987, the impasto brushwork evokes obstreperous actors before refined stage sets.By the early \u201990s, the impasto was gone, and Mr. Mueller was brilliantly synthesizing East and West, high and low. Drifting about the richly hued atmospheres of his paintings are flat silhouettes suggestive of prayer beads; the Buddhist temples called stupas; fans; lattices; medallions; and bulbous cartoony shapes, sometimes with glowing auras. At the same time his background colors evolved into soft plaidlike grids or rosy sunsets, like the one in a work titled \u201cMr. Meltami.\u201d One of Mr. Mueller\u2019s last paintings is dominated by a big levitating black shape suggesting mouse ears.This TriBeCa show, subtitled \u201cOrchidaceous,\u201d has been organized by Carrie Moyer, a professor at Hunter College, and Sarah Watson, director of exhibitions and chief curator at the Hunter College Art Galleries, who collaborated with two Agnes Gund curatorial fellows, Evan Bellantone and Sophia Ma, and 12 Hunter students working toward an advanced curatorial certificate. So many cooks have made this effort a little erratic and short on truly outstanding works. But there are enough to thrill, show us what we\u2019re missing and make us hope for further curatorial initiatives centered on Mr. Mueller\u2019s art. ROBERTA SMITHThrough Oct. 28. Rachel Uffner, 170 Suffolk Street, Lower East Side; 212-274-0064, racheluffnergallery.com.More than just an inventory, \u201cTesting\u201d demonstrates how contemporary photography is also a repository for ideas, a daily journal and a form of note-taking. A book you want to read? Take a snapshot of it. A funny meme in social media? Make a screenshot of it. Upset about something? Broadcast it via images on social media.The caveat here is that images are spinning perilously out of control. Our smartphones can store pictures we don\u2019t even look at after taking. Archives and storage are thus more important than viewing or contemplation of individual images. Pushing back against this idea, Ms. Rafferty presents a series of near-abstract images, fragments or text, baked into glass in a kiln. These images are a bit random and cryptic, culled from archives or bought on eBay, but their process is notable: They essentially propose a form of printing \u2014 or a return to 19th-century methods \u2014 that challenges the history of photographs as images printed on perishable paper.\u201cTesting\u201d raises both technical and theoretical questions for artists and educators, as well as for the average cellphone camera addict. How do you practice, explain or display technologically generated images in a moment when everyone is a photographer and images are beyond ubiquitous? This show functions as an update of the state of photography and a tutorial \u2014 but also, with the glass works, as a perverse proposal for achieving permanence in a warp-speed-changing, disposable-image culture. MARTHA SCHWENDENERIt\u2019s not that his work can\u2019t hold the space, or that there isn\u2019t enough of it. The show includes small photo and video installations as well as conventional prints, and Mr. Khaled fits more of them into a modest gallery than you\u2019d think possible. In all of them he exhibits both a keen eye and a talent for using obsolescent technology to evoke a kind of nostalgia for the passing moment \u2014 a wistful inability to be fully present in one\u2019s own unfolding life.Thirty-two black-and-white screenshots of a staged Grindr conversation between two men from Cairo, one of whom might be a policeman entrapping the other, were shot digitally but printed with old-fashioned darkroom technology, as were 20 excitable close-ups of the artist\u2019s first-ever visit to a male strip club in New York. Sex may be safer in our world capital than in his, the photos seem to suggest, but love is always hard to find. The installation \u201cAs if you weren\u2019t in your own home\u201d presents 176 textured street views of Cairo as the contents of an ostensibly forgotten iPhone on a concrete bench, making it impossible to ignore your own distance from the artist\u2019s material, or the creepy voyeurism tinting your interest in it, as you flip through them.These and other pieces express a powerful longing for an indefinable place of safety that not only isn\u2019t present, but couldn\u2019t be, and it makes the middle of the room vibrate with loneliness. WILL HEINRICHThrough Oct. 27. Minus Space, 16 Main Street, Suite A, Brooklyn; 718-801-8095, minusspace.com.\u201cDiamond\u201d is one of only three works in the show that feature images of the human body. Yet the presence of people is implied and evoked throughout. The exhibition, which the gallery organized with Accola Griefen Fine Art, spotlights three female artists of indigenous descent who use fabric in their work, drawing on \u2014 and sometimes twisting \u2014 our comforting relationship to cloth.Two shaped-canvas constructions nearby pull off a similarly bracing contradiction, marrying a cynical take on the visual language of fashion with a genuine delight in its color and form. In \u201cButterfly Moth in Transcendental State,\u201d two disembodied pairs of female legs, one covered in black-and-white gingham and the other in yellow, are pressed together to form a sexy faux monogram. \u201cBlack Widow Anarchist Hour Glass,\u201d a red-and-black figure eight of gloves, heels and chains, is even balder \u2014 an elegant emblem of sadomasochistic ostentation.

{"Headline": "Can\u2019t You Be a Little Nicer, for the Kids?", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySOCIAL Q\u2019SAmid divorce proceedings, a reader believes that her husband\u2019s icy behavior has caused their children stress.My husband and I have been separated for nine months; our divorce will be final soon. We share joint custody of our two children. The problem: Whenever we\u2019re together, usually at events where the kids are also present (like parent-teacher meetings or visiting day at camp), he won\u2019t speak to me or even make eye contact with me. He will only communicate with me by text. It\u2019s embarrassing for me to have him act this way in front of others. I\u2019m also worried that his behavior creates stress for our children, who are already stressed about the divorce. Any advice?ANONYMOUSIt sounds as if your estranged husband is still (pick one!) too angry, hurt or guilty about your breakup to see beyond himself. This happens sometimes. I\u2019m sorry for your embarrassment and the occasional awkwardness for camp counselors and schoolteachers. But mostly I am worried about your children.Right now, they are learning a terrible lesson in abandonment in the wake of broken relationships. My concern is that they will come to emulate your ex\u2019s silent treatment or fear it mightily in their own relationships. Unfortunately, your husband probably isn\u2019t open to hearing constructive criticism from you now, and text messages are too blunt for conveying it, anyway.Ask him to join you at a counseling session that\u2019s focused on co-parenting. If he refuses, ask your lawyer to request a court-ordered session. If you get into a room with him and a therapist, don\u2019t say one word about your feelings. Who did what to whom is irrelevant now; your children are the sole basis of your relationship.Stay laser focused on negotiating more positive experiences for them. This requires that you and your husband be respectful to each other when you are together and avoid knocking the other when you are apart. It may be hard to pull this off, but it\u2019s essential for your kids\u2019 well-being.A friend was having some repairs done on his bike and asked if he could borrow my father\u2019s spare bike. My father agreed. Unfortunately, the bike was stolen while it was locked to a bike rack at my friend\u2019s place. My father is upset and wants a replacement bike. But my friend thinks he\u2019s only responsible for paying the value of the stolen bike. Should I cover the gap?F.Sometimes intermediaries can be helpful. (I\u2019m thinking of a dashing advice columnist!) But often we just get in the way. Step back from this conflict with your wallet in tow, and encourage the principals to work it out directly. Running interference often lets people take harder positions than they normally would.As guidance: Your father is entitled to a used bike comparable to the one that was stolen. I have no idea how thriving the secondhand market is in your area. If your father and friend can find one on the internet (eBay and Craigslist are full of listings) or at a bike shop, your friend should pay for it. If not, he should pay the reasonable value of the stolen bike. It\u2019s not a perfect solution, but we assume risk when we borrow and also when we lend.I work for a great company that goes out of its way for its employees\u2019 comfort. Lately, I\u2019ve noticed a young Muslim woman praying in an area of the ladies restroom that\u2019s a little separate, but still part of the restroom. I know the company would find her a more suitable place if she asked for one. Am I O.K. saying something to her about this, or should I assume that she\u2019s a grown woman who can look out for herself?ERINPut me down as \u201cyes\u201d to both parts of your question. You should assume (and behave) as if the young woman can see to her own needs. You should also feel free to say a kind word to her, ask if she is comfortable praying in the restroom and venture your opinion that the company would find her a nicer spot if she asked. My only \u201cno\u201d here involves your speaking to anyone else in the company about this. That is the young woman\u2019s call.I received a save the date email to my friend\u2019s 40th birthday party from the party\u2019s host. A few weeks later, another friend, who received the same save the date email, received an actual invitation, also by email. But I never received the invitation. Should I ask the host if I\u2019m still invited, simply show up, or does this mean I\u2019ve been uninvited?ANONYMOUSIt\u2019s not easy to give a party without a glitch or two. But it would be extremely bad form to exclude you from the guest list after asking you to save the date. So, unless you\u2019ve recently become a Real Housewife, or you\u2019re embroiled in a blood feud with the host or honoree, assume that you\u2019re still invited. In the interest of accurate head count, call or write the host: \u201cI received your \u2018save the date\u2019 email but never received an invitation. I look forward to attending. May I have the details, please?\u201d Party on!Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside the World of D.I.Y. Ammunition", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "Millions of weapons aficionados reload their own ammunition and cast their own bullets, acts of individualism that are hallmarks of the broader American gun ethos.Supported byWRIGHTSVILLE, Pa. \u2014 Standing inside his cluttered garage workshop, Michael Crumling, a 29-year-old gunsmith, proudly showed off an impressive collection of lead bullets he has meticulously crafted from scratch. Across the country, millions of weapons aficionados like Mr. Crumling reload their own ammunition and cast their own bullets \u2014 time-consuming hobbies that have been a part of firearms culture for generations.But Mr. Crumling has also created something else in his garage that distinguishes him from his peers, a potential solution to a problem that has long vexed creators of 3-D printed guns: a bullet that wouldn\u2019t ruin the plastic firearms.And yet Mr. Crumling says he has no plans to sell or mass produce the designer round, despite it representing the next step in making printable guns more reliable, and the next front in an ongoing regulatory fight over homemade weaponry.\u201cI don\u2019t see the point,\u201d he said recently, explaining that despite the allure of 3-D guns and ammunition, people who want to build their own firearms can do much better with off-the-shelf parts from their local hardware stores \u2014 or eBay, which he turned to when constructing a submachine gun with metal he filed and bent himself.Amid a national debate over tighter access to guns, and legislative efforts to regulate the unfettered sale of bullets and shells, interest in this pastime has been bolstered by a lively online D.I.Y. community that trades in how-to YouTube videos and engages in passionate web forum discussions about best practices and likely legal challenges.Enthusiasts cite this pursuit as a way to customize ammunition for heightened accuracy or lethality and as a practical skill should bullets be banned or one day be in short supply.\u201cIt gives me time to think,\u201d said Gavin Gear, who runs a popular blog and YouTube channel called Ultimate Reloader, which offers instructional videos and reviews of reloading equipment. He described the process as a relaxing ritual: \u201cNot unlike a blacksmith making a knife or a samurai sword.\u201dBut mostly, it comes down to saving money: Many people who cast bullets at home cited the price of ammunition, which, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, has steadily climbed over the past several decades and hit its highest price this year.David Reiss, who has been casting his own bullets for more than 10 years, said that a box of 50 factory-made cartridges for a .38 special costs about $15, whereas he can reload the same number for roughly $4 in materials.Most bullets are made of lead, and obtaining this metal isn\u2019t always easy.There are car tires that have internal lead weights meant to stabilize the vehicles, and bullet casters customarily turned to their local mechanics to get cheap or free lead. But this source began drying up after 2009 when, because of pollution concerns, the Environmental Protection Agency and a coalition of automakers, tire manufacturers and retailers launched a campaign to phase out the use of the metal for wheel weights.According to the E.P.A., every year more than one million pounds of lead end up in the woods or waterways near roads when the weights fall off vehicles after they hit potholes or are involved in collisions. At least nine states have banned lead wheel weights.Mr. Reiss, who also oversees membership for a bullet casters association, said that most of his members find lead online or by collecting fired bullets at gun ranges. Some scrap yards still sell lead for about 75 cents a pound.Gunpowder is much easier to obtain. It sells for about $25 a pound, is readily available online or at sporting goods stores, and most types require no license, particularly for quantities smaller than 50 pounds.Among avid shooters, the guiding principle is to avoid using guns made, bullets cast or cartridges reloaded by someone else. Faulty handiwork can cause serious injury or ruin a gun if a shoddy bullet jams or if a weapon is defective. Still, despite this stigma, dozens of boutique producers have popped up in the wake of an ammunition shortage that started about 10 years ago, selling these \u201cremanufactured\u201d cartridges, as they are called.As with gun enthusiasts more generally, there is a strain of anxiety that runs through the community of D.I.Y. bullet makers and kit-gun aficionados. In online forums, they worry about the threat of big government intrusions, regulatory barriers, market shortages or price hikes that might limit their access to essential supplies like lead or gunpowder.The government wants to ban guns and \u201cattacking lead manufacturing is one way they have,\u201d wrote one person in an online forum a few years ago after it was reported that the last raw lead smelting plant in the country was closing. Storing lead is legal and worth doing, the writer added.Vocal gun advocates also worry about being tarred by association with fringe elements, such as those who commit massacres, and the regulatory backlash that often follows in their wake. After several high-profile shootings this year, YouTube announced in March that it would ban how-to videos on making ammunition. And a few months later in June, the search engine Bing said it would no longer allow advertisements for products that \u201caid in the reloading process.\u201dThere are subtle cultural and demographic differences within the community of homemade weaponry and ammunition. More retro than futurist, more low-tech than high-tech, casters and reloaders tend to be older and often retirees.The average member in the Cast Bullet Association is a 55-year-old man, typically mathematically-inclined tinkerers from professions where they used their hands, such as dentists, mechanics or surgeons, Mr. Reiss said. The members enjoy the engineering know-how and alchemy experimentation involved in a hobby that requires millimeter exactitude, tireless patience, and constant trial and error.\u201cHow do governments behave if they must one day operate on the assumption that any and every citizen has near instant access to a firearm through the internet?\u201d a statement on Mr. Wilson\u2019s site once asked. \u201cLet\u2019s find out.\u201dBoth parts of the community, though, share a staunch skepticism of the government and an ideological individualism that have long been hallmarks of the broader American gun ethos. Not unlike many supporters of President Trump, many in this group think of themselves as social disrupters, questioning the relationship between citizens and their states. In their view, guns are not just a constitutionally protected right, but also a socio-historical symbol whose very purpose is to level the playing field.In fact, if 3-D printed guns continue to advance and developers indeed solve the ammunition problem, Mr. Crumling said, the market may eventually move toward fully disposable weapons.Not unlike the pepper spray that people buy and keep in their glove boxes or purses, printed weapons could be thrown away after a single use or several uses, he predicted.\u201cIn this scenario,\u201d Mr. Crumling said, \u201cI could see the ammunition becoming the restricted item as opposed to the gun.\u201dSusan C. Beachy in New York and Kitty Bennett in St. Petersburg, Fla., contributed research.Advertisement"}
