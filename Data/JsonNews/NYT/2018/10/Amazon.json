{"Headline": "What Has Actually Changed in a Year", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementIt\u2019s true that sexual harassment and assault are against the law, but again and again the law alone has not been enough to protect women. Criminal cases are notoriously difficult to bring, and civil rights laws are filled with loopholes. Many states are changing and expanding their laws, searching for a better solution.Advocates say that while the laws are still lacking, and do not yet cover the country, this is remarkable progress. We compiled a list of notable highlights from the past year.\u201cAll of the H.R. profession has had to engage in some serious introspection,\u201d said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., the president of the Society for Human Resource Management. Companies have seen that they, too, need to make changes.Beyond the entertainment industry, low-wage workers are seeing some changes, too. Buoyed by the momentum of the #MeToo movement and building on years of independent organizing, activists have successfully raised the \u201ctipped minimum wage\u201d, the pay that servers and bartenders are paid before tips, in some places, and won safer conditions for hotel and domestic workers. The continued momentum is palpable: Last month, workers across the country protested sexual harassment at McDonald\u2019s by going on strike for a day.Perhaps more than any new policy or law, the past year has been defined by a parade of once-powerful men resigning or being fired for sexual misconduct. In some cases, women are taking their place.So over the past year, men have fallen, corporations have changed their contracts, and some states have expanded their laws.

{"Headline": "Letter of Recommendation: Bialys", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLetter of RecommendationThe dumbest place I ever had a panic attack was at brunch. On a sunny Saturday during a long weekend, sitting at the table with my friends, I took one look at the overlong menu, and it started: rapid heartbeat, sweating, that familiar sensation that I was definitely dying. I reported it to my therapist in detail a few days later, and she told me it was most likely situational stress, triggered by feelings of discomfort.Most Americans don\u2019t know about the most famous export of Bialystok, a city in northeastern Poland that once had a large Jewish population, because bialys have become hard to find outside New York, which does still have a large Jewish population. Bialys are a baked disc with a savory filling in the middle where a hole would be. They\u2019re matte, dotted with brown crunchy onions and an uneven texture that comes from baking. Visually, the bialy is a failed bagel, almost as if all the air had been let out and the glossy sheen stripped away.The food is an artifact of the Jewish-American legacy: While the sweeter, chewier bagel went national during the latter part of the 20th century \u2014 in part because Harry Lender realized in the 1950s that he could sell more if he premade, froze and packaged them \u2014 bialys\u2019 presence diminished. Jeffrey Yoskowitz, an author of a cookbook modernizing Ashkenazic Jewish food, contends that bialys just don\u2019t survive as long as their bagel brethren. \u201cThey can last for half a day or so,\u201d he says, \u201cbut an old bialy is hard and tough to chew.\u201dAs Jewish families assimilated away from urban centers into suburbia, bagels became easy to find in the grocery store, and bialys didn\u2019t make the trip. Accordingly, bialys took on an air of metropolitan sophistication, becoming a staple of the Jewish literati \u2014 the former Times food critic Mimi Sheraton wrote an entire book about them, and Philip Roth, according to an essay by the writer Julian Tepper, had one in his usual breakfast order. But now, as prepackaged food continues to proliferate \u2014 be it English muffins, biscuits or bagels \u2014 schlepping to the deli every morning can seem less appealing. When the oldest bialy maker in Brooklyn at the time, Coney Island Bialys and Bagels, faced major struggles after 91 years in 2011, the founder\u2019s grandson told The Times, \u201cNow, people make coffee at home and have a Pop-Tart.\u201dBrunch lists and baked goods, meanwhile, especially in New York, have become incredibly elaborate as time \u2014 and Instagram \u2014 march on. In the past, New Yorkers have endured the occasional lengthy line for indulgent desserts, like Magnolia Bakery cupcakes or Dominique Ansel\u2019s Cronut; now, rainbow bagels with funfetti cream cheese have gone viral. If you want breakfast in New York, you can try out a cragel, which is half croissant, half bagel; pastel-colored unicorn lattes; $11 a\u00e7ai bowls; or quail eggs with Wagyu steak tartare \u2014 all of which complicate breakfast beyond what it is: fuel.In the face of all that overwrought choice, the bialy remains a humble, reliable morning repast. And best of all, sticking to the bialy results in one fewer decision to make. I allot myself a Saturday-morning bialy as a way to collect myself, to create the illusion of productive decision-making with little possibility for panic. Sometimes, I\u2019ll walk to R&D Foods, a shop in my neighborhood; occasionally, I\u2019ll wake up early to go to the Lower East Side and get a bialy from Kossar\u2019s or Russ & Daughters, both classic purveyors of appetizing foods. I get mine topped with butter, a simple choice \u2014 in part because there are virtually no other options.I have everything I need, but I feel a Marie Kondo-like pull toward cutting down on my wants. Every rapid attempt to try every new thing is a moment lost to a myopic fear of missing out. I\u2019m just crowding a perfectly fine existence with noise. I shouldn\u2019t want to check my Twitter; I shouldn\u2019t want to get into celery juicing; I shouldn\u2019t want to buy yet another men\u2019s-wear-darling\u2019s baseball cap. I\u2019ve learned that all these wants, the constant stream of choices that is daily life, crowd my brain. I\u2019m wasting precious time by busying myself with pointless deciding. I should focus on the moment at hand: the bialy, the butter, the easy choice.Jason Diamond lives in Brooklyn. His next book, \u201cThe Sprawl,\u201d will be published by Coffee House Press.Advertisement"}

An early investigation by eBay found at least 50 Amazon representatives had sent hundreds of solicitation messages over the last several years.Some messages appear to suggest the Amazon employees knew they were violating eBay\u2019s terms of service. \u201cEBay does scan for key terms and they don\u2019t exactly like us poking around,\u201d one message read. Other used terms like \u201ca-m-a-z-o-n\u201d or \u201cA.M.Z.N.,\u201d perhaps to evade detection.EBay has issued a cease-and-desist letter, while Amazon says it is investigating the claims.Nested on the servers\u2019 motherboards, the testers found a tiny microchip, not much bigger than a grain of rice, that wasn\u2019t part of the boards\u2019 original design. Amazon reported the discovery to U.S. authorities, sending a shudder through the intelligence community.Then:During the ensuing top-secret probe, which remains open more than three years later, investigators determined that the chips allowed the attackers to create a stealth doorway into any network that included the altered machines. Multiple people familiar with the matter say investigators found that the chips had been inserted at factories run by manufacturing subcontractors in China.Toyota and Honda have both announced partnerships on autonomous vehicles \u2014 showing how difficult the technology is to develop, even for the world\u2019s biggest automakers.Driverless cars promise to redefine the multibillion-dollar auto industry, and the costs of bringing them to market are too big for almost any company to handle independently. \u201cSoftBank alone and automakers alone can\u2019t do everything,\u201d Junichi Miyakawa, SoftBank\u2019s chief technology officer, said.The bill proposes breaking up financial institutions with exposure to more than 3 percent of America\u2019s G.D.P. \u2014 equivalent to about $584 billion in assets. That covers:They would have two years to sell assets. Then regulators would step in.The bill is very unlikely to advance in the Senate.

California\u2019s legislature concedes that the law could be unconstitutional. Its requirements may not apply to companies chartered elsewhere. (A big loophole: By one estimate, the only Fortune 500 company affected is Apple.) And sudden disruption could hurt companies\u2019 performance.Joe Grundfest of Stanford, a longtime advocate for increasing board diversity, said of the move, \u201cI fear the cure is worse than the disease.\u201dAndrew\u2019s suggestion? Individual investors, big and small, pressing boards to diversify:Firms like BlackRock and pension funds like Calpers, the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System, are already working to effect change. BlackRock has told companies that it wants to see at least two female board members at the companies it invests in. Calpers wrote to 504 companies in 2017 asking them to improve diversity, and has voted against directors at companies that have failed to respond to its requests. Hopefully, the constant drumbeat on this topic will only drive additional responsible companies to make progress.Mr. Flannery was supposed to turn G.E.\u2019s fortunes around. But like his predecessor, Jeff Immelt, he\u2019ll be handing over a lot of problems: G.E. says it is taking a $23 billion write-down in its power business, and its financial arm and pension fund are messes.A renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement, Trump advisers argue, removes the possibility that a trade war could break out on the continent and will make North America a more attractive place for investment.When combined with U.S. tariffs against China, which boost the costs of production there, foreign companies will start moving investment out of China, the administration calculates. That would weaken China\u2019s ability to produce next-generation technology and put additional pressure on Beijing to make trade concessions sought by the U.S.Mr. Trump appears happy to play a long game. \u201cChina wants to talk very badly,\u201d he said at a news conference yesterday. \u201cI said frankly it\u2019s too early to talk, because they\u2019re not ready.\u201dMr. Musk had long promised that the Model 3 would be available for as little as $35,000. But the least costly version available now starts at $49,000, and the price nears $60,000 if a customer wants the Autopilot driver-assistance software and other options. The company has said that more than 400,000 customers are waiting to buy Model 3 sedans, and that each paid a $1,000 deposit. Many who put down deposits may be waiting for the more affordable base model.Charles Schwab turned his budget-basement retail brokerage into an investment giant that manages over $3.6 trillion of customer money. But fintech start-ups are after those customers.While tech is becoming ever more dominant, Bettinger says the human element is what will help the company ward off the threats posed by online competitors. When it comes to financial services, he says, clients ultimately want to talk to a live person \u2014 in a web chat, on the phone, or at a branch office. In 2016, less than a year after introducing its robo-adviser, Charles Schwab began offering fee-based personal consultations for accounts of at least $25,000.Companies such as Ant Financial or Amazon, which analysts have speculated will eventually move into finance, would be challenged to build those kinds of offerings at Charles Schwab\u2019s scale, Bettinger says. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that we\u2019re a blend of Amazon and Nordstrom,\u201d he says.Harvard Business School received 9,886 applications for this fall\u2019s entering class, down 4.5 percent from last year \u2014 the biggest drop since 2005. Applications to Wharton fell 6.7 percent to 6,245. At Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business, they slid 4.6 percent to 7,797. Such top schools are still receiving many more applications than they can accept, but the declines mark a reversal after years of growth.Reasons for the slump? Rising college debt has made M.B.A.s too expensive for many people, and higher hurdles for work visas have pushed foreign students to international schools instead.Nellie Bowles of the NYT explains why:As the case wound its way up to the Supreme Court, it threatened to gut California\u2019s Coastal Act of 1976, which enshrines public access to beaches as a right.\u201cIf I were to ever win in the Supreme Court, I\u2019d be depressed about it,\u201d he told The New York Times this year. \u201cI support the Coastal Act; I don\u2019t want to weaken it by winning.

The film, \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk,\u201d would have its premiere there without these 16 seconds, though it\u2019s hard to say if anyone not named Barry Jenkins would have noticed.This was my second meeting with Jenkins, and \u2014 more than during the first \u2014 his demeanor seemed bifurcated, one foot still in the shaping of the work, the other stepping into the role of a presenter, devising talking points that would carry him from Toronto through the film\u2019s limited release on Nov. 30, perhaps into the awards season beyond. \u201cI learned the hard way on \u2018Moonlight\u2019 that it\u2019s best to be at the forefront of the conversation,\u201d he told me that morning. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like tennis, you know? You want to be leading, and not playing off the back foot.\u201d Still, he was eager to show me outtakes, moments that might have been. He spoke of the film as if it possessed an immune system, one with a long list of irritants it couldn\u2019t abide. \u201cThe film rejected it,\u201d he said wistfully of one deleted scene.A work of cinema, like a novel, is a collage. The finished product is a result of hundreds of moments of cut and paste: this take moved and placed next to another one, this voice recorded to change the feel of a scene shot with no voice-over in mind. A shift to the arrangement or size of one small piece can make the whole collage feel unstable, particularly to the collagist. Each time McMillon played the pass again, the score, composed by Nicholas Britell, swelled up and embraced us before shrinking away on command. The scene \u2014 on its own, compellingly composed \u2014 slid closer to rapturous with the addition of music. A novelist would kill for such a tool.\u201cWhat do you notice about that sequence?\u201d Jenkins asked me. I\u2019d watched it several times at this point, but I wasn\u2019t sure what in particular I was supposed to notice. \u201cO.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll call it. That\u2019s me imitating Baldwin. The voice-over, that\u2019s the one bit of voice-over not taken from the book.\u201dJenkins\u2019s apartment, with its wall-length windows, film-related art and preponderance of books, seems an apt place to house this small part of Baldwin\u2019s literary footprint. In his living room I spotted Marilynne Robinson\u2019s \u201cGilead\u201d (\u201cI\u2019ve read it at least six times\u201d), Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s \u201cPale Fire\u201d and, of course, plenty of books by Baldwin himself. On the cement floor \u2014 under a bookshelf, behind a vintage cream couch \u2014 I spotted Jenkins\u2019s Oscar for best adapted screenplay. Jenkins saw me looking and said he was working on a better spot for it. But he did have the envelope revealing the best-picture win for \u201cMoonlight\u201d framed and hung on the wall, alongside a congratulatory note from Warren Beatty \u2014 one of the presenters who mistakenly announced that \u201cLa La Land\u201d had won \u2014 telling him the honor was \u201cmuch deserved.\u201d After the ensuing hubbub subsided, Jenkins went to M\u00e9rida, Mexico, for a few days to clear his mind. \u201cMy favorite thing to do is to sit in the window, the front window of a cafe looking out at the sidewalk,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is the worst thing to do, or at least in the immediate aftermath of what happened.\u201dIn addition to this new film\u2019s being the much-anticipated follow-up to \u201cMoonlight,\u201d it is also the first big-screen English-language film adaptation of a novel by Baldwin, a writer whose works are closely guarded by his estate. Much of the country, owing to our current political reality and Raoul Peck\u2019s 2016 documentary, \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d has recently become better acquainted with a truth black readers grasped long ago: James Baldwin was right about everything. Jenkins began his adaptation of Baldwin\u2019s fifth novel back in 2013, writing a faithful screen version of the 1974 book, in which a pregnant 19-year-old woman named Tish works, alongside her family, to prove the innocence of her child\u2019s jailed father, a young sculptor. This being Baldwin, of course, there\u2019s more to it: a meditation on the radical implications of declaring yourself an artist while black, on what it means to be poor in New York, on the power and limitations of romantic and filial love.According to Jenkins, this would be the first of his feature films to directly grapple with political themes, but I begged to differ, bringing up the role that gentrification played in his first feature, the 2008 morning-after romance \u201cMedicine for Melancholy\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s set in San Francisco, and the two leads even stumble onto a round-table discussion of rising housing prices. In \u201cMoonlight\u201d the ravages of the war on drugs and the brutality of poverty are not at all apolitical. True, Jenkins said, but with that film, \u201cthe whole movie is created to almost force the audience to confront what this character is feeling. And so it\u2019s really easy to sit outside the film and just want to hug the film, to hug the main character. But this is Baldwin. In Baldwin, everyone\u2019s implicated, including himself. So I think there\u2019s not a passive path through this film.\u201d It didn\u2019t appear to bother Jenkins that this might make it harder for some \u201cMoonlight\u201d devotees to stay along for the ride to \u201cBeale Street.\u201d There were still plenty of reasons to want to hug this film too.Barry Jenkins is 38, under six feet tall and solidly built, with a curated nerdiness: translucent glasses, brightly printed oxford shirts, slip-on sneakers, a canvas tote bag. He is willfully kind, and has a plethora of ways to put others at ease. He might call you \u201cbruh\u201d or \u201cboss\u201d or \u201cmy dear\u201d or \u201cboss lady,\u201d though when adamant he\u2019s apt to call anyone, regardless of gender, \u201cman.\u201d When he listens to you speak, he lets you know he\u2019s there via a steady cadence of mm-hmms, about 10 per minute, sometimes more. He has the sort of smile that if glimpsed across the room at a cocktail party might compel you to walk over and stand near him. \u201cI will not annoy, rebuff or humiliate you,\u201d this smile says.\u201cOne of the things he says to me a lot is, you know, \u2018flies with honey,\u2019\u2009\u201d his producer, Adele Romanski, another former film-school classmate, told me. \u201cI think that\u2019s a life philosophy that he extends to the work.\u201d This is a useful stance if you are interested in getting actors to open up, to bare themselves. The stereotype of the American director-auteur may be of the demanding genius who bullies his actors into transcendent performances, but Jenkins prefers a nurturing approach: \u201cI try to find a language that the actor can participate in,\u201d he says. \u201cThere has to be a language for every single person on set.\u201d These efforts translate onto the screen. But what exactly is it that\u2019s being translated?It begins with vulnerability. I\u2019ve spent my life loving black men, and I understand black masculinity to be malleable, its fabled rigidity overblown. After work, in the dark, I\u2019ve heard whispered secrets, the wanderings of restless minds. And yet all of my moviegoing life I\u2019d never seen this quotidian vulnerability so accurately rendered in film \u2014 not without a wink, a glance away, some posturing that distances \u2014 until I saw Jenkins\u2019s \u201cMoonlight.\u201d An adult son tries to keep emotional distance from his mother, a recovering crack-cocaine addict, and cannot; tears stream down his face instead. A drug dealer confirms his profession to a boy (the same son, but younger), thereby admitting to playing a part in what holds the mother captive; the boy leaves, and the drug dealer (a father figure, not a monster) stares straight ahead, defeated. In \u201cBeale Street,\u201d we watch the main character, Fonny, listen to his friend Daniel describe the psychological horror of prison. Daniel begins the conversation nonchalant, swigging a beer, and ends it with his shoulders stooped forward, the light drained from his eyes. His honesty and helpless frustration is so familiar from my actual life that it is nearly too much to bear \u2014 a perfect moment of cinema.I asked Jenkins about his ability to capture a rarely depicted kind of black male vulnerability as he drove us down Vermont Avenue in his white Toyota Prius. He said nothing for a while, a first in our hours of conversation. A chopped-and-screwed version of Solange\u2019s \u201cA Seat at the Table\u201d drifted from the speakers. \u201cI will say that\u2019s not a goal, but I would hope that\u2019s true,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI think I know what you\u2019re talking about, especially these last two films.\u201dJenkins is open, specific and effusive when talking about craft, narrative, culture, sports or politics. Less so when discussing himself. He tends to speak in long bursts, turning an idea around out loud before hitting on the declarative statement he likes. He started talking about his work adapting \u201cIn Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,\u201d the autobiographical script by Tarell Alvin McCraney that became his breakthrough feature. The story had uncanny overlaps with Jenkins\u2019s own biography: an addicted mother, an upbringing in the same Miami ghetto, subjects Jenkins would not have been comfortable exploring without McCraney\u2019s words as an intermediary. \u201cI can take Tarell\u2019s experience,\u201d Jenkins said, \u201cwhich is much more open than mine, and I can sew cinematic storytelling into it.\u201d McCraney, whose gay coming-of-age story informs the plot of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d describes Jenkins, who has a girlfriend, as approaching emotionality with something akin to a queer imagination: \u201cI think he has moments where his imagination is not normative. Just look at his work and see. Where there should be broad strokes there are polka dots.\u201d\u201cBarry loves love,\u201d Romanski says. \u201cIf you look at his work, there are three different types of love stories from \u2018Medicine\u2019 to \u2018Moonlight\u2019 to \u2018Beale,\u2019 but they\u2019re all love stories.\u201d Love, yes, but also pain. Nat Sanders, who edited both \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cBeale Street\u201d with McMillon, says there\u2019s \u201ca duality\u201d to Jenkins: \u201cAny time he wants to, he\u2019s so charismatic and exuberant. When I do a pass of a scene that really excites him, you get the best reaction you could ever hope to get. He\u2019ll do airplanes around the room and jump up and down, yell \u2018Bruh! Bruh!\u2019 and it\u2019s the best. But also, he\u2019s very private and very quiet.\u201d In \u201cChlorophyl,\u201d a short film Jenkins directed in 2011, working without a formal script, the main character, played by Ana Laura Trevi\u00f1o, reads a James Baldwin quote, translating into Spanish: \u201cLove does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up.\u201d In a moment of improvisation, Jenkins had handed her his leather cellphone case, on which he\u2019d paid to have these words embossed.Although he values romance in film, Jenkins is hesitant to say he places as much importance on romantic love in his own life. \u201cI\u2019ve allowed myself to experience growth in love once in my life, but it was so long ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve become accustomed to being alone, or if because of the way I grew up I became conditioned to being alone. But I guess my identity has been formed around being alone.\u201dWe were back downtown now, in the Arts District, pulling up to a bookstore on the hunt for a novel I\u2019d recommended to him. It turned out that this one, the second of three we\u2019d try, did not sell fiction. Jenkins did a lap anyway, searching for a book of photography by Roy DeCarava, whose iconic images of midcentury Harlem served as a visual reference for \u201cBeale Street\u201d and appear at the beginning and end of the film. On our way back to the car, we passed a boutique where Jenkins stopped to inquire after the owner: Had she had her baby yet? She had. Jenkins conveyed his congratulations. For a man who considers being alone a comfortable mode of existence, he makes reaching out to others look easy.He grew up in Knight Manor (also known as the Village), a housing project built close to the larger Liberty Square projects. His mother was addicted to crack, a fact that Jenkins is both open about and firm in not expounding upon. When \u201cMoonlight\u201d had its premiere, he told me, \u201cWe rented a theater just for her to go see the film, and on the day of, she decided she could not see it. Probably my fault. I should have flown back.\u201d Something previously open about Jenkins\u2019s posture \u2014 the set of his shoulders, the steadiness of his gaze \u2014 closed off as he told me this. Later, he says, his mother happened upon a bootleg copy of the film at a corner store; she bought it and watched at home. \u201cWhat I see in that,\u201d Jenkins says, \u201cis she just wanted to watch it by herself in an environment she could control. She actually complimented Naomie\u2019s performance\u201d \u2014 Naomie Harris, who plays the main character\u2019s troubled mother. \u201cSay of that what you will.\u201dKnight Manor was torn down, and a new campus for Miami Northwestern high school built on top of it. Jenkins would attend classes there, preparing for the future atop his own demolished childhood home \u2014 though he doesn\u2019t recall giving this symbolism much thought. Of his home life during these years he reveals little, though he alludes to it often. \u201cI grew up in a certain kind of way,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a crutch. I started therapy, I stopped. I should start it again. It\u2019s a crutch.\u201d His reluctance to explain further may also reflect his general disinterest in creating a public persona, and in the self-mythologizing that goes with it. \u201cIt was what was so difficult about everything that happened with \u2018Moonlight,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not smart enough to say as much as I have to say about the film without revealing things about myself. But that\u2019s the last thing I ever want to do.\u201dIn high school Jenkins played football, got good grades, made it to senior year. He had been admitted to the University of Florida, but after a trip to visit F.S.U. in Tallahassee, \u201cI thought: This is the blackest place in America. I gotta be here.\u201d In Tallahassee, he lived with high school friends and intended to pursue a creative-writing degree \u2014 he used to be obsessed with the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop \u2014 until one day he walked by a sign for the film school and had a change of heart. He began pursuing a dual degree. \u201cI remember my first short film,\u201d he says. \u201cI put my roommate in it, and it was a strange film. We shot it on a Bolex\u201d \u2014 a spring-wound camera associated with avant-garde film \u2014 \u201cso it wasn\u2019t like a narrative. It was more experimental.\u201d His roommates, he says, \u201cjust looked at me like they thought I had lost my mind.\u201d In the film department, though, Jenkins began making connections with the collaborators he\u2019d work with over the next two decades: McMillon and Sanders; James Laxton, the cinematographer for all his feature-length films; and Romanski and Mark Ceryak, two of his partners at the production company Pastel.After watching other students\u2019 work, Jenkins didn\u2019t think he had the technical ability to compete. \u201cDigital filmmaking wasn\u2019t anywhere near what it is now,\u201d he says; working on film, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t see what you were doing. There\u2019s no playback on set. You can\u2019t shoot it and then immediately pull it up on the memory card.\u201d The filmmaker needed solid knowledge from the start. Jenkins took a year away from the film program to study the craft on his own, finishing his creative-writing credits in the meantime. He moved in with Laxton. The popular directors to emulate in their program were those who made big-budget, Spielbergian features. Jenkins watched foreign art-house cinema in hopes of finding an alternative aesthetic approach. \u201cI remember we\u2019d have running DVDs playing in the background,\u201d Laxton told me. \u201cAnd as people would come in and out the house, we\u2019d kind of sit down and talk about it.\u201d Before that year, Jenkins would have named \u201cDie Hard\u201d as his favorite film. After, it was the Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai\u2019s stylized, lovesick \u201cChungking Express.\u201dWhen Jenkins returned to the program he wrote and directed the short film \u201cMy Josephine,\u201d a mostly subtitled account of an Arab immigrant couple who own a laundromat and wash American flags for free after the Sept. 11 attacks. Over wine at a bar near his apartment, Jenkins recalled making it: \u201cThat\u2019s me as a dude who grew up in the hood!\u201d he said, his face alight once again. \u201cThat\u2019s not me now, 20 years removed from the hood. That\u2019s me, you know what I mean? And it\u2019s taking my experience of being somebody from the hood who now is a fish out of water in this academic setting, in this film consortium, taking that feeling and putting it into these things. It was empowering.\u201dAfter graduation, the director Darnell Martin gave Jenkins his first film job, as her assistant on the set of the TV movie \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God.\u201d His work on \u201cMy Josephine,\u201d she told me, had \u201cso much poetry in it. Visually it was really stunning.\u201d Here was an avenue through which Jenkins could grapple with feelings he otherwise preferred to leave unexamined. \u201cI think when I found film,\u201d he said, \u201cI found a way \u2014 I still hide a bit \u2014 but a way to not hide as much. I felt like I could put these things into the work because it\u2019s the movie. It\u2019s not me.\u201dOn a very hot August day, Jenkins sat in a color-grading studio in Greenwich Village with Laxton and the colorist Alex Bickel. The big screen at the other end of the room showed a scene at Showmans Jazz Club in Harlem. The characters Joseph and Frank, played by the veteran actors Colman Domingo and Michael Beach, sat at the far end of the bar. The room was realistically smoke-filled for the early \u201970s, but too smoky for the purposes of the film. Jenkins and Laxton took turns guiding Bickel on how to fix the problem. They moved on to a close-up of Beach\u2019s face, its topography made more intense by his look of dejection. Jenkins made a noise of approval. \u201cIt was like Take 3 of the zoom,\u201d he said, \u201cand he just locked in.\u201dJenkins enjoys moments when his actors make direct eye contact with the camera. He and Laxton are in agreement on the power of this sustained looking, how holding the camera on an actor can bring out a host of emotions in the viewer. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a dark theater with 300 people sitting next to you,\u201d Laxton said, \u201cand you have someone looking at you from a big screen, I think it does something to you as an audience member.\u201d Alfred Hitchcock employed these sorts of shots, as did Jonathan Demme (who can forget Hannibal Lecter\u2019s stare?), but unlike those filmmakers, Jenkins and Laxton rarely shoot theirs during moments of great emotional agitation. Instead they catch their characters at ease, quiet. \u201cBarry captures silence in a way that we don\u2019t see much, and we especially don\u2019t see that much in the African-American film experience,\u201d Mahershala Ali, who won a best-supporting-actor Oscar for playing the drug-dealer-cum-father-figure in \u201cMoonlight,\u201d told me. \u201cYou usually don\u2019t see black people holding peace and occupying silence, having to fill those voids in that way.\u201dJenkins shoots these moments intuitively, waiting until he feels something. \u201cI\u2019m not directing them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are just giving me this thing. And sometimes you can look at an actor and see, Oh, there\u2019s the soul.\u201d And if they\u2019re comfortable enough, he says, they can look directly into the camera without losing that soul. \u201cInstead they\u2019re going to give it to the audience.\u201d KiKi Layne, whose starring role as Tish in \u201cBeale Street\u201d marks her first foray into film from theater, described it as looking into a black hole: \u201cI think at one point I told him that \u2018Man, this feels so strange\u2019 and he was like, \u2018I know, but I need it, I need it.\u2019\u2009\u201d The actors don\u2019t know where these shots will wind up in the film, and neither, necessarily, does Jenkins, at the time. Later, though, the emotions viewers read on the actors\u2019 faces \u2014 a close-up of Fonny near the end of the film goes from anxious and unsure to settled \u2014 feel made for the precise moment when they appear on screen.These looks don\u2019t quite break the fourth wall, because the actors are not regarding the audience. In \u201cBeale Street,\u201d they\u2019re most often gazing at someone they love. For nonblack audience members, it might be the first time they\u2019ve had a black person direct such a gaze their way; Jenkins offers a glimpse at a world previously hidden to them. For a black viewer, there\u2019s more likely a kind of recognition: I know that face, although I have never seen this actor before. Or, if the actor is one you\u2019re familiar with, it can go the opposite direction, letting you see the person anew. Regina King, who plays Tish\u2019s mother in the film, has played a mother or wife as many times as I have fingers, over decades. But who was this woman on the screen, staring at her reflection in a mirror, summoning her courage, while also staring at me? Typecasting actors isn\u2019t simply about having them play a role they have played before; it\u2019s about locking them into the same aesthetic representation of that role. \u201cHe knows that it\u2019s not just his film,\u201d King told me. \u201cHe can\u2019t do this without the talent of other people, and he allows those talents to shine.\u201dDuring the festival season leading up to the theatrical release of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d Jenkins directed an episode of the first season of the Netflix series \u201cDear White People,\u201d revolving around an actor named Marque Richardson; his character has a gun pulled on him by campus police officers, and by the episode\u2019s end he breaks down, crying. I have personally known Marque Richardson for 15 years and have watched him act in all sorts of roles. This episode was the first time he ever felt a stranger to me on screen.This level of artistic freedom is hard to come by in the world of Hollywood-financed film, he thinks, but the possibility of leading such a life \u2014 not feeling obligated to have one foot planted in the role of presenter \u2014 captivates him. He could also see himself teaching film to others in 15 years. In the short term, though, he is working on a forthcoming limited-series adaptation of Colson Whitehead\u2019s \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d for Amazon, and a screenplay based on the life of the gold-medal-winning boxer Claressa Shields. \u201cI wish I had taken a break after the Oscars and all that stuff, but I just went right into this movie, and right into the writers\u2019 room for \u2018The Underground Railroad.\u2019 I didn\u2019t really process all that stuff. And now this movie is finally ending, and I think it\u2019s time for a moment to process.\u201dIt was our last few minutes together, and I wanted to know \u2014 having heard him speak of a more unfettered artistic life, and witnessing him bring happiness to others with such ease \u2014 what exactly made him happy. \u201cI\u2019m never happy, man \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s just the case,\u201d he said. He used to think he didn\u2019t deserve to be. Then: \u201cI think making other people happy makes me happy.\u201d He recalled helping Alex Hibbert, who plays the child version of the main character in \u201cMoonlight,\u201d find his footing as an actor. \u201cWhen other people do things on my sets that either they didn\u2019t believe they could do, or understand they could do, or that surprises them?\u201d That, he said, was amazing. It was a matter of helping them tap into the ineffable. \u201cWhat I say to the actors, if they ask, is that it\u2019s not about a certain meaning; it\u2019s definitely about a certain feeling. How can we work together to create this feeling, even if the feeling is not knowable?\u201cI really want that simple life, you know?\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why I fell in love with this book.\u201d He quoted the moment in Baldwin\u2019s novel when Fonny, the young sculptor jailed for a crime he swears he didn\u2019t commit, says he only needs art and the love of his woman to survive: \u201c\u2009\u2018I got two things in my life, man \u2014 I got my wood and stone, and I got Tish.\u2019\u2009\u201d Despite the increasing complexity that comes with a successful Hollywood career, Jenkins desires the same. \u201cI have my wood and stone now,\u201d he said.Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft Says It Will Sell Pentagon Artificial Intelligence and Other Advanced Technology", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut the divergent paths also underscore concerns inside the American defense and intelligence establishments about how the United States will take on a rising China.In the past two years, the Chinese government has set goals for dominance in the next decade in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and other technologies that it believes will allow its military and intelligence agencies to surpass those of the United States. Pentagon officials have questioned how committed domestic technology companies are to keeping the country on the leading edge, the way Raytheon, Boeing, IBM and McDonnell Douglas did during the Cold War.Even before Friday\u2019s announcement, Microsoft seemed like the only plausible alternative for the Pentagon\u2019s giant cloud project, called JEDI, in which Amazon is considered the front-runner.But the announcement by Microsoft may have a greater effect on future technologies, including warning systems and weapons powered by artificial intelligence. And the company\u2019s leadership, after brief debates this summer, concluded that by dropping out of the bidding, Google was also losing any real influence in how the weapons would be used.\u201cThis was not a hard decision,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president, said in an interview in his office. \u201cMicrosoft was born in the United States, is headquartered in the United States, and has grown up with all the benefits that have long come from being in this country.\u201dBut Mr. Smith seemed to be trying to strike a middle ground.He has sued the United States government repeatedly to halt Washington\u2019s efforts to gain access to customer information stored on the company\u2019s servers, and he is pressing for new international agreements to limit how the United States and its adversaries can use cyberweapons.He also argued in the blog post that \u201cto withdraw from this market is to reduce our opportunity to engage in the public debate about how new technologies can best be used in a responsible way.\u201d\u201cWe are not going to withdraw from the future,\u201d he said.Mr. Smith\u2019s comments stood in sharp contrast to statements by Google this month. When the company dropped out of the competition for the JEDI cloud computing contract, officials said they \u201ccouldn\u2019t be assured that it would align with our A.I. principles,\u201d a reference to a set of principles issued in June in which the company vowed not to design artificial intelligence products that would be used to harm people, or for surveillance or armaments. The contract is believed to amount to about $10 billion over a decade, but the shape of cloud computing that far into the future is hard to predict.Some industry experts saw Google\u2019s statement as an effort to gain political credit for backing out of a competition it was unlikely to win. Unlike Amazon and Microsoft, Google is missing some of the government certifications it would need to provide the software to the military.Microsoft is believed to have a good shot, in part because President Trump has made no secret of his distaste for Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder and the owner of The Washington Post. But even as Mr. Trump frequently dismisses the \u201cAmazon Washington Post,\u201d Amazon is considered the front-runner for the contract, in large part because of the company\u2019s experience in building the C.I.A.\u2019s cloud computing ability over the last five years. In an analysis published in June, Deutsche Bank Research concluded that Amazon \u201cis best positioned to win the lion\u2019s share of the JEDI contract\u201d and that Microsoft was the \u201cmain challenger.\u201dCulturally, Google and Microsoft are far different; while some Microsoft employees have expressed unhappiness with the company\u2019s government contracts, most recently with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the protests among Google engineers and other employees were far more intense and far more public.Microsoft has been far more willing, however, to challenge the government. It went to court to try to keep the United States from being able to subpoena Microsoft for the emails or other records of customers whose data was stored abroad. (The suit was rendered moot by federal legislation.) It has been pressing for a \u201cdigital Geneva Convention\u201d that would, like the traditional Geneva Convention, wall off certain civilian targets. The United States government has resisted the idea so far, not wanting to limit a president\u2019s options to use cyberweapons against power grids or other targets on which civilians depend.\u201cWe can\u2019t control how the U.S. military uses our technology once we give it to them,\u201d Mr. Smith argued. \u201cBut the military is subject to civilian control. And we believe we will have an opportunity to influence those discussions \u2014 but it\u2019s not up to us.\u201dBut to a large degree, the import of Microsoft\u2019s announcement has more to do with the politics of confronting China and less to do with its immediate prospects.The Pentagon has struggled in recent years to bring the Silicon Valley innovation to new weapons systems and sensors. The acquisition and testing process is so long that many high-tech systems are outdated by the time they begin. While the Obama administration succeeded in creating an outpost in Silicon Valley, called DIUx, or Defense Innovation Unit Experimental, its budget was small and some promising off-the-shelf technologies \u2014 for example, small, inexpensive satellites that could be fired in large numbers over North Korea to detect mobile launchers \u2014 have been delayed for years.But the next challenge facing both the government and the companies is whether American-based companies will be limited in what kind of artificial intelligence technologies they can sell to China.In his interview, Mr. Smith would not indicate whether Microsoft would also provide all of its products to, say, the People\u2019s Liberation Army. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue we are going to have to work through,\u201d he said. But the reality, he and other executives in the technology field have noted, is that the Chinese would not accept American-made artificial intelligence code, for fear that the United States would turn off Chinese access to the cloud services in a time of conflict.Kate Conger and Sheera Frenkel contributed reporting from San Francisco, and Karen Weise from Seattle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Problems With Britain\u2019s New Digital Tax", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe UK\u2019s finance minister has taken the plunge with a new plan for taxing technology giants \u2014 but it is flawed.Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, on Monday unveiled a 2 percent tax on the revenue that big search engines, social-media platforms and online marketplaces earn in the country.The digital-services tax appears to target Amazon, Facebook and the Alphabet business Google. All of those companies have been criticized for shifting revenue and costs between jurisdictions, allowing them to minimize profit where tax would otherwise be burdensome. Operating in the virtual world \u2014 and with the resources available to three of the six largest public companies on the planet \u2014 makes that easier than for traditional businesses that have a physical presence.The European Union is considering a similar tax at 3 percent. That is billed as a stopgap, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development working on a revamp of cross-border tax rules that would allow the value added to a virtual business by a country\u2019s citizens \u2014 be it via their data or online purchases \u2014 to be identified and taxed in that jurisdiction. But that\u2019s a long shot.Meanwhile, there are problems with Mr. Hammond\u2019s measure.First, the tax may not be aggressive enough. Take Facebook as an example: It generated over 2.2 billion British pounds, or about $2.9 billion, of British digital ad revenue in 2017, according to the market research company eMarketer. A 2 percent slice of that would have earned the government some \u00a345 million. Facebook\u2019s British subsidiary had a bill for cash corporate taxes of just \u00a316 million in the same year.That looks like a step in the right direction. But Facebook\u2019s consolidated pretax profit margin topped 50 percent last year. Assume the same for the United Kingdom under a new global regime with a 20 percent tax on profit, and the company could have been on the hook for well over \u00a3200 million. So it might be better for companies to take a chances with Mr. Hammond\u2019s levy.Another difficulty is that the biggest companies caught by such a tax are based in the United States. Rightly or not, that smacks of protectionism, sour grapes or both. And Washington has little incentive to negotiate, especially if it might lose some of its own tax revenue.Mr. Hammond is also risking a backlash just as Britain heads for Brexit. It\u2019s bold to try to provoke wider change \u2014 but in this case, it might not work.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "How the Blockchain Could Break Big Tech\u2019s Hold on A.I.", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Pairing artificial intelligence and the blockchain might be what you would expect from a scammer looking to make a quick buck in 2018.The two concepts, after all, are two of the most buzzed about and least understood ideas in the tech universe.Despite how easy the combination is to mock, the idea of applying the blockchain to artificial intelligence is attracting a growing roster of serious entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, many of them with impressive academic credentials.Professor Song, Dr. Goertzel and other entrepreneurs say they believe the blockchain could encourage a broader distribution of the data and algorithms that will determine the future development of artificial intelligence.\u201cIt\u2019s important to have machine learning capabilities that are more under the user\u2019s control, rather than relying on these big companies to get access to these capabilities,\u201d Professor Song said in an interview.The start-ups working toward this goal are applying blockchains in a number of ways. At the most basic level, just as the blockchain allows money to be moved around without any bank or central authority in the middle, artificial intelligence experts are hoping that a blockchain can allow artificial intelligence networks to access large stores of data without any big company in control of the data or the algorithms.Several start-ups are setting up blockchain-based marketplaces, where people can buy and sell data.Unlike Google and Facebook, which store the data they get from users, the marketplaces built on Ocean Protocol will not have the data themselves; they will just be places for people with data to meet, ensuring that no central player can access or exploit the data.The goal, Mr. McConaghy said, is to \u201cdecentralize access to data before it\u2019s too late.\u201dOcean is working with several automakers to collect data from cars to help create the artificial intelligence of autonomous cars. All the automakers are expected to share data so none of them have a monopoly over it.Another start-up, Revel, will pay people to collect the data that companies are looking for, like pictures of taxis or recordings of a particular language. Users can also let their phones and computers be used to process and categorize the images and sounds \u2014 all in exchange for digital tokens. Over a thousand people already have put their computers to work.These sorts of marketplaces are only the outer layer of the blockchain-based systems that are being built to handle artificial intelligence data.One of the biggest concerns that people have about the data being collected by Google and Facebook is the access it gives these companies to the most private details of our lives.Professor Song is working on a blockchain, known as Oasis, that will use advanced techniques to secure the data being bought and sold, so that no one \u2014 not even the company using the data \u2014 will get a copy of it.In the Oasis network, all data moving through the system will be locked into encrypted bundles. Researchers will be able to run the data through their machine learning algorithms \u2014 and prove that the calculations were done correctly \u2014 without ever actually seeing the underlying data.One project building on top of Oasis, known as Kara, will allow medical researchers looking at the behavior of specific diseases to train their machine learning models with data from actual patients, without the data ever being exposed.Oasis has already raised $45 million from several big-name venture capital firms, but they have competition from another start-up created by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called Enigma.Enigma got started before Oasis and is working with partners like Ocean Protocol to ensure that people contributing data to marketplaces can set the exact terms under which their data can be used.\u201cIt lets you have a network of A.I.s that nobody owns,\u201d Dr. Goertzel said.Hanson Robotics is planning to use SingularityNET to feed information into its humanoid robot, Sophia. Unlike Amazon\u2019s Alexa service, which answers questions using services approved by Amazon, Dr. Goertzel wants Sophia to reach out to other artificial intelligence providers if she can\u2019t find the right answer.\u201cWe are now using SingularityNET to upgrade Sophia\u2019s intelligence,\u201d Dr. Goertzel said. \u201cIn principle, it is much more flexible because we don\u2019t have a centrally controlled market.\u201dAs with most blockchain applications, a lot of technical work still must be done before these new systems can take off \u2014 and it is not clear that all of the roadblocks are surmountable. Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, is investing in the area, but he says he believes it will take some time before these systems can prove themselves. He is hopeful that when they do, they will play an important role in democratizing the industry.\u201cRight now the data isn\u2019t really being valued in an open market, it\u2019s just being given to a few companies,\u201d Mr. Ehrsam said. \u201cWhat if there was now a free market for data?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Romanov Is Not Too Happy With \u2018The Romanoffs\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe Romanoffs,\u201d Amazon\u2019s new drama series in which characters are descendants of Russia\u2019s royal family, has not received the best reviews.But one of the harshest reviews has come from an unlikely source: The Romanovs themselves (the name can be spelled both ways). Well, from at least one member of the House of Romanov: the self-declared Grand Duchess Maria of Russia.The duchess is a resident of Spain who claims to be the rightful heir to the crown that disappeared from Russia during the Bolshevik Revolution. She is a great-great-granddaughter of Czar Alexander II, who was assassinated in 1881 and was a grandfather of Nicholas II, the czar who was killed, along with his wife and five children, by the Bolsheviks in 1918.\u201cThe Romanoffs\u201d is a drama in which each movie-length episode centers on characters who are meant to be descendants of Russian royalty, but are living today, such as an elderly woman in Paris struggling to cope with a Muslim caregiver, and an American man experiencing marital problems.The chancellery\u2019s news release said that descendants of the Russian crown have a \u201cfascinating history\u201d ripe for television. But the release said that Matthew Weiner, the creator of \u201cThe Romanoffs,\u201d had squandered the chance to present that history. Instead, the release said, Mr. Weiner has made \u201ca series of plodding fictional stories on banal subjects of no consequence.\u201dThe chancellery would not have issued the release at all if \u201cThe Romanoffs\u201d were simply dull, the release went on. \u201cDullness may be disagreeable, but it seldom causes offense or insult,\u201d it said. \u201cAlas, to the series creator\u2019s great discredit, \u2018The Romanoffs\u2019 manages to do both.\u201dThe duchess\u2019s main problem appears to be the show\u2019s opening credits. These portray, somewhat comedically, the murder of Czar Nicholas II and his family. \u201cTo see the martyrdom of the Imperial Family treated as a piece of gory entertainment\u201d \u2014 especially in the year of the 100th anniversary of their death \u2014 \u201cwas appalling,\u201d the news release said.\u201cSurely standards of decency still count for something in the portrayal of certain events and the individuals involved,\u201d the release said.It was unclear if the duchess\u2019s views are shared by the many other people who are \u2014 or claim to be \u2014 descendants of the Romanovs.Mr. Weiner, who also created the wildly popular \u201cMad Men\u201d series, declined to be interviewed about the duchess\u2019s critiques.

{"Headline": "Children\u2019s Allowances in a New Form: Debit Cards Linked to Parents\u2019 Phones", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byYour Money AdviserNo need to worry about coming up with cash for a child\u2019s allowance. Parents can now choose from a rapidly expanding menu of prepaid debit cards, aimed at giving them digital oversight of their children\u2019s spending and saving habits.\u201cPrepaid has really evolved,\u201d said Christina Tetreault, a staff attorney with the financial services program at Consumers Union.The latest offerings include cards with slick companion apps from financial start-ups like Greenlight, Current and goHenry. Unlike traditional debit cards, which are directly attached to checking accounts, all must be loaded with money by parents.The digital tools aim to fix an increasingly common problem: Parents don\u2019t always have cash on hand. So they can be caught short when a child needs money for an outing with friends, to put gas in the car or to complete a chore. With an app, parents can put money on a child\u2019s debit card with a few taps on their phone.Details vary by card, but typically parents sign up for the account, then link their checking account or debit card as a way to fund the child\u2019s card. Parents can give cards to multiple offspring, even those of tender age. (GoHenry recommends its card for children as young as 6.)Parents can use the apps to establish allowance transfers, set spending limits, or offer payment for chores and a dizzying array of other tasks. Parents can get text or email messages when their child makes a purchase. And parents can quickly tap the app to disable the card if the child loses it.Financial advocates say that beyond all the bells and whistles, the main benefit of the \u201csmart\u201d prepaid cards is that they can prompt parents to talk with their children about money.\u201cThese cards are a great tool to learn about money management, if they\u2019re used right,\u201d said Will deHoo, founder and executive director of the FoolProof Foundation, a nonprofit that promotes \u201chealthy skepticism\u201d about financial products.That means emphasizing budgeting and saving, not just spending \u2014 which, after all, is a debit card\u2019s main function. \u201cA debit card never met a sale it didn\u2019t like,\u201d Mr. deHoo said.Promoters say the cards do encourage saving. Greenlight lets parents automatically match money the child sets aside in a savings account. Rates on bank savings accounts are still low \u2014 2 percent is considered generous \u2014 making compound interest a hard sell. But parents can direct the app to pay the child their own, personal interest rates \u2014 say, 20 percent or even 100 percent \u2014 as an incentive. (The card account itself doesn\u2019t pay any interest.)Greenlight also allows parents to supervise spending by choosing the type of stores or restaurants where children can shop. Money on the card is put into two categories: for spending anywhere, or for only preapproved stores and websites. If the child tries to buy something at a nonapproved store \u2014 or tries to spend more money than is available on the card \u2014 the purchase is declined.Children with mobile phones can get their own version of the app, which lets them check balances or seek a parent\u2019s permission to buy a specific item.Greenlight, with financial backers that include Amazon and two big banks, became available in 2017 and now has about 200,000 paying customers, said Tim Sheehan, the company\u2019s chief executive. Next week, the card will add new features, including the ability to use the card at A.T.M.s.Current, backed by investors including an arm of Fifth Third Bank, lets parents offer their children the option to earn money by doing chores. One example: \u201cMow Lawn. $10.\u201d Once the chore is done, funds are transferred. Stuart Sopp, Current\u2019s founder and chief executive, said his 9-year-old daughter had a card and often told him, \u201cI want more chores.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a parental toolbox,\u201d he said.The idea is to let children make spending mistakes, with guardrails to prevent disasters, Mr. Dwight said. \u201cIf you nag the kid about every transaction,\u201d he said, the child may tune you out.Here are some questions and answers about debit cards for children:Do prepaid cards for children charge fees?Yes. Most of the new cards charge a monthly or annual fee. They typically don\u2019t charge extra fees for adding money onto the card, but it\u2019s always wise to check the fee schedule before enrolling.Is money on the prepaid cards protected by federal deposit insurance?Most financial start-ups team up with federally insured banks that issue the debit cards. So the funds are typically held in a way that qualifies for insurance by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, up to the $250,000 limit. Ms. Tetreault, the Consumers Union lawyer, said it\u2019s always wise to check a card\u2019s user agreement and disclosures to check whether funds are insured.What other options are available if I want digital oversight of my child\u2019s money?Some banks, like Capital One and USAA, offer traditional checking accounts for teenagers that are managed jointly with parents, online or via an app. Patricia Seaman, a spokeswoman for the National Endowment for Financial Education, suggests that parents double check to make sure any bank account they open for a child does not allow overdrafts, to avoid possible fees.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In \u2018The Black Cat,\u2019 the Titans of Terror, Karloff and Lugosi, Face Off", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStreamingNow considered a classic, \u201cThe Black Cat\u201d (1934) was the first movie to feature Universal\u2019s two prized assets, Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi, and the studio\u2019s excitement was palpable. It\u2019s \u201cthe monster of \u2018Frankenstein\u2019 plus the monster of \u2018Dracula,\u2019 plus the \u2018monstrousness\u2019 of Edgar Allan Poe,\u201d the ads boasted, \u201call combined by the master makers of screen mysteries to give you the absolute apex in super-shivery.\u201dUlmer spent almost his entire career working in B movies. \u201cThe Black Cat\u201d was his only major studio production and it is nothing if not excessive \u2014 wildly expressionistic and saturated with 19th-century Romantic music. The movie is distinguished by its fluid camera, an abundance of wordless passages, and the long meaningful looks its characters exchange. Ulmer was clearly experimenting with a new sort of melodrama; Heinz Roemheld\u2019s score \u2014 mashed-up themes from Liszt, Chopin, Brahms and Schumann \u2014 is said to be present in 55 out of the movie\u2019s 69 minutes.Horror in the Hollywood movies of 1920s, \u201930s, and \u201940s generally came from abroad. Lugosi, a native Hungarian, and Karloff, born in London despite his Slavic-sounding stage name, had distinctive foreign accents. So it is with \u201cThe Black Cat,\u201d which strands a pair of na\u00efve American newlyweds (Julie Bishop and David Manners) in an Art Deco mansion somewhere in deepest Hungary. Caught up by a storm, the honeymooners become pawns in a chess game \u2014 at once ludicrous and unrelenting \u2014 between Lugosi\u2019s hysteria-prone Hungarian psychiatrist and Karloff\u2019s lisping Austrian architect.The acting is also a competition between the two stars, each trying to top the other\u2019s hammy turn. Lugosi\u2019s character is ailurophobic \u2014 his morbid fear of cats justifying the movie\u2019s title \u2014 and more than a bit sadistic. Karloff, however, gets to play the real monster, a war criminal who built his steel-and-glass castle on the site of unspeakable carnage. Suggesting more than it can show, \u201cThe Black Cat\u201d somehow eluded the moral enforcers of the Production Code despite its allusions to incest, necrophilia and human sacrifice, not to mention a black Mass staged beneath a stylized crooked cross.Lugosi (whose screentime was twice that of Karloff but was reportedly paid half as much) portrays a megalomaniacal surgeon so obsessed with Poe that he keeps a stuffed raven in his study and has reconstructed the torture machine from \u201cThe Pit and the Pendulum\u201d in his basement. Karloff appears as an escaped convict foolish enough to allow Lugosi\u2019s character to surgically rearrange his features.While \u201cSon of Frankenstein\u201d would be the last movie in which Karloff played the monster, it gave Lugosi, as supporting actor, his greatest role. Almost unrecognizable behind a scraggly beard, croaking his lines through a mouth full of sharpened teeth, he exudes a gleeful Charles Manson-like malevolence as Ygor \u2014 a grave robber who survived his hanging, albeit with a broken neck. A commercial success, \u201cSon of Frankenstein\u201d jump-started a new, mediocre cycle of Universal horror films. Karloff left the studio after one, the sci-fi gangster movie \u201cBlack Friday\u201d (1940); Lugosi, who had a minor role in it, stuck around a bit longer to reprise Ygor in \u201cThe Ghost of Frankenstein\u201d (1942).Lugosi, who received second billing on the movie\u2019s posters, most likely for his diminished marquee value, has a far smaller part, appearing as the none-too-bright, lank-haired servant of Karloff\u2019s best customer. Still, their major scene together is rich with subtext. Rival creatures to the end, the pair enact a flashback to the more cosmic death struggle of \u201cThe Black Cat.\u201d\u201cThe Black Cat\u201d can be streamed via Amazon Prime, Google Play, iTunes and YouTube. \u201cThe Body Snatcher\u201d is available from Amazon Prime, Google Play, Vudu, and YouTube. \u201cThe Raven\u201d can be found on Vimeo.A picture caption with an earlier version of this column reversed the identities of two actors.

{"Headline": "U.S. Stocks Became Expensive. Are Other Countries Better Bets?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 6.7 percent decline in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in six trading sessions through Thursday nearly erased the 7.2 percent gain the index recorded in the third quarter. The market rebounded a bit on Friday. But even before the six-day plunge, the narrowness of the quarter\u2019s advance hinted that the market was on shakier ground than the peak reached in the period might have suggested.The strong performance during the quarter was concentrated in American stocks, primarily of a handful of big-name technology companies, such as Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Markets fell almost everywhere else.The gap between stock returns in the United States and elsewhere has led some \u2014 but definitely not all \u2014 strategists to conclude that for American investors, there are better prospects abroad.\u201cThe U.S. is an expensive, frothy market priced to give you terrible forward returns,\u201d said Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, who is seeking opportunities in foreign markets.On the other hand, Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said the outperformance of the American market was justified \u2014 and may well continue. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world, and between the U.S. market and the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest of the developed world has half as much growth, and it\u2019s the same with profits. It\u2019s a legitimate divergence. It\u2019s not solely a matter of sentiment.\u201dLegitimate or not, the divergence between foreign and domestic markets \u2014 and how much they cost \u2014 accelerated in recent months. The Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-U.S. exchange-traded fund was down 4.9 percent in the year through September, while the SPDR S.&P. 500 E.T.F. rose 8.9 percent, helped by a 7.2 percent increase in the underlying index in the third quarter. Based on the ratio of share prices to book value, American stocks were more than twice as expensive in September as stocks in the rest of the world, according to Bank of America, a record premium.Leading the laggards downward were emerging markets, several of which have plunged because of heavy amounts of foreign debt, and Europe, where indexes are heavily weighted in banks that are owed a lot of that money.The comparative strength of domestic stocks has been justified by the superior performance of the American economy and the presence of so many high-quality, high-growth companies, investment advisers like Mr. Golub say. Others, like Mr. Arnott, counter that American business prospects cannot be marvelous enough to justify such a cavernous valuation discrepancy, especially over the medium-to-long haul. Foreign markets, especially in the developing world, are bound to bounce back and reward the patience of investors who take a chance on them, they say.Mr. Arnott, for example, highlighted an array of measures showing that American stocks are expensive when compared with their own history or with foreign alternatives, especially in the developing world.\u201cEmerging market stocks are cheap,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been whacked because of fears that a trade war will do these economies great damage.\u201d With valuations at half the levels of American stocks\u2019, he said, \u201cthey\u2019re reflecting the worst case, not the most likely case.\u201dBonds issued in the developing world also offer good value, in his view. Debt denominated in local currencies yields 6 percent or more, double what long-term Treasury issues offer.Yet emerging market assets may not seem like bargains to anyone familiar with the currency collapses and economic difficulties besetting countries like Turkey and Argentina. Lower stock prices or an extra three or four points of yield may be small compensation for the possibility of further currency losses or the added risk of default.But those countries account for a minuscule fraction of emerging stock and bond markets. Other places are on more solid economic and financial footing, although it might take a while before recognition sets in that they\u2019re still moving in the right direction.\u201cThe emerging market story is intact, but you have to have a longer-term focus; emerging markets are still not for the faint of heart,\u201d said Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants. \u201cThe best bets in these markets continue to be the ones growing strongly.\u201dStrong, persistent economic growth, propelled in part by young, rising populations, can overcome occasional bouts of weakness in mature economies, policy errors at home, large foreign debts and other unfavorable conditions, she said.Indonesia, for instance, one of her favorite markets, runs large fiscal and current-account deficits, Ms. Morrissey said. The country owes a lot of money to foreign lenders, and its currency, the rupiah, is trading near where it was during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, but economic growth is at a five-year high.India, another favorite, also runs large deficits and has a weak currency. On top of that, India is \u201cmassively oil reliant,\u201d she said. But its economy grew at an 8.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, driven by the country\u2019s dynamic private sector.\u201cThere are still significant portions of the populations in these countries striving for an iPhone,\u201d Ms. Morrissey said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a significant growth story.\u201dThe arguments for investing in the United States are strong, too. Measures of consumer and business sentiment are close to all-time highs. The September reading of the Conference Board index of consumer confidence, for example, was the highest since 2000.Highlights of mutual fund performance in the third quarter.Leaders and LaggardsStocks vs. BondsAmong general domestic stock funds.Average returns, by fund category.12 MONTHS3RD QTR.LEADERS12 MONTHS3RD QTR.++++15.20.42.10.8%+++\u20135.40.70.10.1%General stock fundsAlger SmallCap Focus++++++++51.829.548.935.730.957.747.936.5%++++++++16.416.315.213.813.813.613.113.0%Taxable bondsQuantified STFInvestorInternational stocksVirtus Zeven.InnovativeMunicipal bondsBaron DiscoveryInstl.Growth vs. ValueCongress SmallCap GrowthReturns in the third quarter.GrowthBlendValueDelaware SmidCap Growth+8%Morgan StanleyInst.

American stock indexes are heavily weighted toward technology companies, while European indexes have a larger proportion of banks, which have been struggling in part because of their extensive exposure to lenders in the developing world.Fund returns in the third quarter confirmed the outperformance but not by as much as you might expect from the moves in the underlying assets. The average domestic stock fund rose 5 percent, according to Morningstar, led by portfolios specializing in health care, energy and technology. The average international fund gained 0.1 percent, depressed by losses in India and China funds.The average taxable bond fund returned 0.7 percent in the period.Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, also finds the discrepancy in investment returns justified.\u201cThe U.S. leadership this year is a reflection of diverging fundamentals in different parts of the world,\u201d she said. \u201cSignificant stimulus\u201d \u2014 from the Federal Reserve until recently and then from a big round of tax cuts \u2014 \u201chas helped lift corporate earnings. I\u2019m not surprised that the U.S. is outperforming by so much this year. I guess the question is: Can the outperformance last?\u201dIt\u2019s a tough one to answer in a world of interconnected economies. Some developments that would worsen conditions at home might cause even greater damage abroad, Ms. Patterson said, while favorable domestic developments might provide a greater lift elsewhere.If the Fed has second thoughts about monetary tightening and turns more dovish, for instance, it could depress the dollar, easing pressures on foreign economies with large debts denominated in dollars. \u201cThe rest of the world could catch up,\u201d she said.By contrast, an acceleration of the slow-motion trade war that has been worrying investors all year \u2014 although not enough to put much of a crimp in market returns \u2014 would hurt the domestic economy, but it could damp growth to a much greater extent in places like China, she said. A slowdown in China, in turn, would have a more serious impact on Europe than the United States.Another potential impediment to European markets, Ms. Patterson said, is the imminent start of a monetary tightening cycle by the European Central Bank. The Fed has been far more hawkish on inflation, but its European counterpart may soon join it in raising interest rates and selling assets acquired in its quantitative easing program.With such prospects, she prefers to maintain a particularly high allocation to domestic stocks. But favorable moves on the trade front would persuade her to put more into emerging markets, particularly China.Mr. Golub contends that investors have \u201calmost an obsession with what could go wrong\u201d for American stocks, although he acknowledged that \u201cif people were really cautious, the market wouldn\u2019t be going up\u201d as it did in the third quarter.He also highlighted a number of factors that are \u201ca risk but not a problem,\u201d including inflation, the elections next month and the trade backdrop. He said that valuations are not cheap and that long-term returns could suffer for that.\u201cThere is an unbelievable number of potential threats to the stock market, but none of them are derailing the market yet,\u201d Mr. Golub said.The last word in that quote might worry some investors, especially lately, but he recommends owning some of the highest of fliers, including technology stocks that focus on consumer services, such as Priceline and Amazon, and on communication services, including Netflix, Alphabet and Facebook. He also favors financial companies.If there are risks but not problems in the United States, as Mr. Golub put it, Nick Kaiser, manager of the Sextant International fund, finds problems but not as much risk overseas.\u201cThere are more opportunities in foreign markets than domestic,\u201d Mr. Kaiser said. Even a country like Argentina \u201cis a great place to invest,\u201d he said, as long as the money is put to work in stocks when they trade at low valuations, and not bonds, which are far more susceptible to inflation.His strategy is to look for high-quality companies, even if the quality of the economy in places where they do business may be suspect. An example in Argentina is MercadoLibre, an online retailer that operates across South America.Other portfolio holdings that Mr. Kaiser mentioned include Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, a French engineering company; Nice, an Israeli cybersecurity concern; and two Dutch businesses: the consumer electronics company Philips, and ASML Holding, a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\u201cWe see a lot of opportunities in Europe,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there may be more in Argentina and Brazil.\u201dMr. Arnott likewise sees a world full of healthy investment prospects. He finds it easier to list what he would avoid than what he would buy.\u201cThere\u2019s a richer spread of opportunity than usual, just not in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just need a little upside surprise and you\u2019ve got a bull market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "From Agriculture to Art \u2014 the A.I. Wave Sweeps In", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe internet is a technology of low-cost communication and connection. Everything from email to e-commerce to social networks has hinged on the internet\u2019s transformative role in changing the economics of communication. All those connections suddenly became both possible and cheap.Artificial intelligence is a technology of low-cost prediction and discovery. It exploits the new resource of the digital age \u2014 vast amounts of data \u2014 to identify patterns and make predictions. Much of what A.I. does today can be thought of as a prediction. What product to recommend, what ad to show you, what image is in that picture, what move should the robot make next \u2014 all are automated predictions.Imagine, the authors suggest, that Amazon\u2019s A.I. gets good enough that the company takes the next step \u2014 shipping goods before they are ordered. It knows what you want so accurately that returns would be minimal and make Amazon even more efficient.It would also change the nature of shopping \u201cfrom an opt-in experience to an opt-out experience,\u201d Mr. Agrawal said in an interview.A fanciful thought experiment? Perhaps. But Amazon was granted a patent for \u201canticipatory shipping\u201d in 2013.Just where artificial intelligence is taking us, at what pace and along what trajectory, is uncertain. The technology, of course, is raising serious questions about its potential impact on jobs, privacy and politics.Still, A.I. is marching into practically every field, from agriculture to the arts. Here are five examples:A.I. holds the promise of sharply reducing the amount of costly and lengthy trial and error in traditional drug development and testing. Deep Genomics, based in Toronto, is not only using its technology to winnow the number of target compounds to attack a particular disease, but also to predict the biological outcome in humans. \u201cThe guesswork is tremendously reduced,\u201d Mr. Frey said.It is still early for Deep Genomics and its approach. The first of its compounds will be tested in clinical trials beginning in 2020.PlantVillage and International Institute of Tropical Agriculture have developed a simple A.I. assistant, called Nuru (\u201clight\u201d in Swahili). Wave the phone over a plant leaf, and the software diagnoses the disease or pest blight and suggests low-tech treatments. Once downloaded, the app does not require wireless access to cellular data or remote computing power, which means it works in rural villages.KONE\u2019s new equipment is being made with the sensors and wireless links, while its older models are being retrofitted. Data streams off each machine, every second, providing measurements that include vibration, leveling, braking, temperature, door openings and cargo weight.The data is fed into the A.I. software, which looks for telltale signals that a machine is in need of maintenance or a new part, before it fails. \u201cYou go from being reactive to proactive and predictive,\u201d said Larry Wash, an executive vice president of KONE.The results on the elevators deploying the new technology so far are encouraging. There are 25 percent fewer breakdowns and 60 percent fewer customer reports of problems than on elevators serviced on traditional maintenance schedules.Root is a bet that with modern technology, it can do better, charging good drivers less for auto insurance, up to $100 a month less \u2014 and the start-up can still be quite profitable. Since its insurance app was introduced in the fall of 2016, Root has expanded into 20 states to date.Root uses the sensors in a smartphone to measure location, acceleration, braking and turning. The myriad sensor data is parsed by clever software for signals of risky driving behavior \u2014 lane changing, tail gating, even texting (typing generates tiny, but measurable, vibrations).Potential customers download the Root app and are monitored for a test-drive period, typically two or three weeks. The algorithmically-vetted safe drivers are approved.\u201cOur models are much more accurately predictive of accidents,\u201d Mr. Timm said.Root insists that it collects data only for its own risk analysis. \u201cWe\u2019ve never sold data and never will,\u201d he said.Deep Dream used so-called neural networks to digest millions of images, identify visual patterns and then create something new \u2014 a kind of aesthetic prediction.Today, many computer artists are using A.I. tools to create new imagery, design interactive visual experiences and probe machine intelligence. Their work benefits from a wealth of A.I. software that is freely shared among computer scientists and artists.Computer art has been around for decades, and Hollywood\u2019s digitally animated movies and special effects are marvels of rich, evocative imagery. But that is more comparable to computer-aided design, with the software serving as a supercharged pencil or paintbrush, still firmly controlled by the human artists.Follow Steve Lohr on Twitter: @SteveLohrAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Transformational Bliss of Borrowing Your Office Clothes", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "Rent the Runway\u2019s Unlimited service saves working women something more valuable than money: their time.Supported byOn a Friday morning in August, Sushma Dwivedi, a senior vice president at Edelman, the global marketing conglomerate, bustled around her Harlem apartment in a blue-and-white-striped cotton dress. With her toddler and newborn out with a nanny, Ms. Dwivedi, who was on maternity leave but preparing for a meeting with a senior colleague in a few days, intended to get some things done. High on her list: assessing the contents of a recently delivered dark-blue garment bag.Ms. Dwivedi, 37, is a member of Rent the Runway Unlimited, a service that, for $159 a month, allows subscribers to borrow up to four pieces of clothing and accessories from a designer-laden library of more than 450,000 items and keep them for as long as they want. If subscribers can\u2019t bear to part with something, they can buy it, generally for about half the retail price. (A cocoon-like wool cardigan from Jil Sander Navy sells in stores for $1,275, but costs $765 through Rent the Runway.) When members buy an item, or return it, via a prepaid shipping label in their garment bag, a spot for something new opens up.Though Rent the Runway was originally conceived as a solution for women who didn\u2019t want to invest in party-wear they might use only once, Unlimited has become a strategic solution for professional women such as Ms. Dwivedi, who manages 30 employees in Edelman\u2019s food and beverage department and regularly gets called into the offices of clients like Pepsi and Chobani.\u201cThe wardrobe thing, when I was trying to lose the baby weight, was frustrating,\u201d said Ms. Dwivedi, recalling her first pregnancy. \u201cI knew what I could buy when I was pregnant. I knew how big I was, but afterward, what was I going to do? Buy an entire wardrobe at five pounds thinner, five more pounds thinner, and on and on?\u201d She added, \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to look frumpy or have someone turn around and say, \u2018Wow, she looked a lot better before.\u2019\u201dSince Rent the Runway introduced Unlimited two years ago, the service has amassed tens of thousands of subscribers in part by promising to solve the problem of what to wear to work, for everyone from new hires to C-suite executives. (The company declined to confirm its user numbers, but analysts said that perhaps 50,000 people are active subscribers.) It is fast displacing the start-up\u2019s original business model. Rent the Runway was founded in 2009 as a way for people to borrow couture on an item-by-item basis. This year, Unlimited, which also has an $89-a-month tier, will account for the majority of revenue.\u201cI just have too much stuff: stuff that I bought, that I don\u2019t like anymore, that I don\u2019t wear anymore,\u201d said Kristin Lemkau, the chief marketing officer of JPMorgan Chase and a self-described Unlimited \u201csuperfan\u201d of two years. On a recent Wednesday morning at her office, on the 36th floor of a glossy Park Avenue monolith, she wore a flouncy, frilly black dress sprayed with pastel-colored daisies. Lemkau, 51, who helps oversee a $5 billion budget, routinely speaks at conferences on her firm\u2019s behalf, sometimes in places like the South of France or the Swiss Alps, which come with their own, rarefied dress codes.Before signing up for Unlimited, she regularly met with a wardrobe consultant near her Rye, N.Y., home. \u201cI\u2019d go to her house and pick out stuff,\u201d Ms. Lemkau said. \u201cI was never thrilled with the clothes. It was the same old black dress and black pants, and I started looking like I was in mourning all the time.\u201dShe ruffled her daisy-printed hem. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve bought this, but it\u2019s super cute, it\u2019s fun. I look forward to getting dressed every day instead of, \u2018What thing am I going to wear? Is my dry cleaning back?\u2019 I don\u2019t remember looking forward to getting dressed, ever.\u201dUnlimited frees mental space for women to think about more important matters: what to say in that big meeting; how to describe their employment history in a crucial job interview; how to, in the grand scheme of their professional lives, get ahead. \u201cWomen spend more time, more energy, more, just, time being distracted with shopping and thinking about the way they look compared to men,\u201d Ms. Lemkau said. \u201cEven at work, men were basically just deciding what tie to wear, and now, for the most part, they don\u2019t even wear ties. Is this service another way to potentially level the playing field?\u201dBefore joining Unlimited in 2016, Ms. Dwivedi spent untold hours rifling through fast-fashion stores like H&M and Zara, searching for a trendy blazer or statement necklace to liven up her work wardrobe. These days, she typically \u201cshops\u201d on Rent the Runway\u2019s iPhone app, scrolling through silk blouses and floral dresses as if they were Spotify songs, assessing member-submitted photos of the clothes out in the real world.\u201cI\u2019m having drinks with my mentor on Wednesday. I wasn\u2019t sure what to wear to that, so I gave myself a couple of options. If this is as flattering as I think it could be, I\u2019ll probably wear this,\u201d Ms. Dwivedi said, holding up a striped, sleeveless linen shift dress in a clear plastic sheathe. \u201cAnd if not, this maxi\u201d \u2014 a floor length, flowy black dress emblazoned with tropical blossoms.This is the trade-off. While Ms. Dwivedi luxuriates in the designer clothing that does fit \u2014 she received a steady stream of compliments from co-workers on a pink, plaid Trina Turk coat that she wore while pregnant with her first child \u2014 the stuff that does not must be sent back to the warehouse before she can order something new. The process generally takes a day or two.The Rent the Runway app and website regularly prompt users to review what they borrowed, and with a few taps, Ms. Dwivedi could report that the dress was not true to size. Despite the inconvenience of waiting for another shipment, she prefers this process to trying on outfits in a store. \u201cI would rather have the shaming of it all and the judging experience on my own,\u201d she said.\u201cOver 50 percent of our customers provide data back to us after they rent, every single time,\u201d said Jenn Hyman, 38, who is Rent the Runway\u2019s chief executive and co-founder. \u201cWithout an incentive, our customers want to make this service better for other women, and they\u2019re telling us because they want us to fix the problem.\u201d She was standing in the company\u2019s 250,000-square-foot warehouse in Secaucus, N.J. \u2014 a structure it says is the largest dry-cleaning facility in the world. Rent the Runway calls it the Dream Fulfillment Center.It is garment-tracking infrastructure of staggering proportions. Unlike companies that have democratized access to movies (Netflix) or music (Spotify), Rent the Runway peddles in touchable, feel-able, not-streamable material goods \u2014 garments that lose buttons and rip and stain and go through God knows what after they slide onto the bodies of their temporary owners.\u201cThere are three times during the process where we\u2019re doing a quality inspection,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. Next to her, an employee was sniffing the contents of a garment bag, one of hundreds that UPS and FedEx deliver to the warehouse each morning. \u201cCustomers sometimes tell us that there\u2019s an item they didn\u2019t wear, but our smell test is more important,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. \u201cEvery single item goes through a cleaning and sanitation process.\u201dIndustrial washers spun, dryers tumbled and garments on hangers clicked as they made their way through a maze of scaffolding, en route to a machine that would spit them out encased in plastic. \u201cThe system knows that that blouse needs to wait for a pair of jeans to come in,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. \u201cIt won\u2019t send it over to shipping until all of the items in that order have been brought together. That\u2019s something someone\u2019s wearing to an event,\u201d she said, gesturing at an off-the-shoulder gown of salmon-colored chiffon. \u201cVegas!\u201d she trilled, pointing at a white-and-red-sequined bomber jacket.Of Rent the Runway\u2019s 1,200 employees, 770 are in Secaucus. A second such facility is due to open in Dallas next year, to speed up delivery times to users not on the East Coast. An additional 130 people work on the company\u2019s engineering, information technology and analytics teams. They continually tweak algorithms to identify pieces that customers might like and highlight them on the app\u2019s home screen, similar to recommendations offered by Amazon and Netflix.\u201cWe\u2019re collecting hundreds of thousands of data points every week: style, fit of the garment, what occasion you wore that to, what else is going on in your life, who are you?\u201d said Ms. Hyman. \u201cWe\u2019re creating one-to-one style personas for every user we have, which is helping us create an individual home page for you, where we can recommend clothing that you might like. Part of that is not just to recommend the things that you\u2019re already comfortable with, but to help you discover things that you didn\u2019t know you\u2019d love.\u201d Essentially, they\u2019re using data to engineer whimsy \u2014 that feeling of seeing something in a store window and rushing in to plunk down a credit card.Rent the Runway shares its findings with the designers whose clothing it stocks. (The company buys wholesale, like a department store.) \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing amount of data that traditional retailers don\u2019t always share: What other brands is she wearing, how many times do our dresses get dry-cleaned and still come back as new?\u201d said Jan-Hendrik Schlottmann, the C.E.O. of the high-fashion label Derek Lam. \u201cYou learn a lot from that and from reading the comments the clients make online. It\u2019s great market research, frankly.\u201dMr. Schlottmann said he doesn\u2019t worry that rentals will cannibalize sales. \u201cThe Rent the Runway customer is not a customer we\u2019re losing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to spend $1,500 on a dress, because she doesn\u2019t understand the value. We kind of think we\u2019re taking money away from fast fashion by letting her try on and rent clothes. Instead of having her buy Zara\u2019s copy of our dress, I\u2019d rather have her experience our construction, our fabric. Hopefully, she will buy it when she\u2019s ready.\u201dAs a private company, Rent the Runway declined to share its revenue or profit. Ms. Hyman also declined to specify how many Unlimited members there are, but said the subscription business was up 150 percent year over year. In March, an investment of $20 million, in part from the founders of the Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba, reportedly put the company\u2019s valuation at $800 million.Even if Rent the Runway is small compared to established fashion brands, the NPD analyst Marshal Cohen considers the company\u2019s impact significant. \u201cThey are a disrupter. They have really changed the dynamic of what goes on in the marketplace,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not building wardrobes the way we used to, we\u2019re not buying as many shoes, as many bags, we\u2019re wearing a few staple items and mixing and matching them. We\u2019ve gotten so casual in the workplace that we\u2019re basically wearing loungewear.\u201dSeventy-five percent of the clothing that gets shipped out to Unlimited members falls into the broad bucket of business casual. Members have written in asking for more tailored options, and as a result, this fall, the company\u2019s business formal assortment \u2014 suits and pencil skirts by labels including Theory, Tibi and Iro \u2014 will increase 250 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s attire that a conservative lawyer could wear to the office everyday,\u201d Ms. Hyman said.Before joining Unlimited in 2016, Ariel Cohen, a 29-year-old account director for the New York public relations firm Magrino, spent about $500 a month at shops like Club Monaco and Anthropologie. She\u2019s cut that to $100 a month \u2014 and eliminated her monthly dry cleaning bill, also around $100. \u201cI make investments in things now that I consider \u2018forever pieces,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m able to have the more colorful and loud parts of my wardrobe be things that I can wear once or twice, post a pic to Instagram, and move on.\u201d She gestured at her Jason Wu pants: white, wide-legged, emblazoned with big, blue flowers. \u201cLike these, I\u2019d never buy.\u201dFor women entering the job force, Unlimited has been a crucial hack. \u201cTo go from college to my first career, it was really challenging,\u201d said Elisabeth Armstrong, 24, a former television reporter in Tennessee who recently transitioned to a finance job in Colorado. \u201cMy salary was not really conducive to buying a new wardrobe.\u201d\u201cI found myself falling into this pattern of fast fashion, buying a blazer here, a dress there,\u201d before signing up for Unlimited in 2016, Ms. Armstrong said. \u201cIt\u2019s really challenging for us, as women. Men have the standard suit. With the emphasis on your personal brand, your presentation, I think there\u2019s more weight on appearance than there ever has been.\u201d\u201cI had exhausted the options that I own \u2014 my co-workers had seen them all,\u201d said Caroline Peck, a 25-year-old advertising associate in Birmingham, Ala. \u201cRecently, I was in San Antonio for a big client meeting. I rented this beautiful dress, and even my client complimented me. Then I told them about Unlimited.\u201d Ms. Peck ended up buying the dress, a black, full-skirted Erin Fetherston number with a white Peter Pan collar.Sarah Joyce, who works at a major technology company in Los Angeles, joined Unlimited last December, feeling frumpy and uninspired by her wardrobe. Her initial attitude, she said, was: \u201cRad. I\u2019m going to take more risks, I can send it back, I\u2019m going to do the Chlo\u00e9, the Veronica Beard.\u201d\u201cI was like, now I know how female baller executives look hot,\u201d said Ms. Joyce, 40. \u201cYou\u2019re faking it till you make it. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d She got so much praise on a maroon Cinq \u00e0 Sept maxi dress that she ended up buying it for $500. Then it happened again. \u201cI ended up buying everything,\u201d said Ms. Joyce. \u201cI bought a romper, blouses. It was a problem. Ninety percent of the stuff I rented, I never returned. Then it occurred to me this stuff has been worn by other people so many times, that\u2019s probably why it\u2019s cheap.\u201dIn June, wary of devouring Unlimited\u2019s collection of designer purses, Ms. Joyce canceled her membership. She also grew weary of attracting attention at the office. \u201cIt made such a fuss at work,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Oh, is that also Rent the Runway?\u2019 I felt like a walking billboard.\u201dSome women don\u2019t mind this, like Elizabeth Derby, a 29-year-old senior product marketing manager at Artsy, an art start-up. I spoke to her this summer, when she worked at Betterment, a financial services start-up in New York. \u201cThe funny thing is, there are a lot of men that work here, more men than women, and way more guys in the office know that I use Rent the Runway because they\u2019re always commenting on stuff and saying, \u2018I wish they had that for guys,\u2019\u201d Ms. Derby said. At the time, she was part of a Slack channel that Unlimited subscribers at Betterment use to rate outfits and collect garment bags for drop-off at a showroom Rent the Runway keeps on West 15th Street in Manhattan. (Returns taken there get processed faster than those sent to the warehouse.)\u201cThere\u2019s also the sustainability factor,\u201d said her tag-checking co-worker, Danielle Shechtman. \u201cIf you keep buying clothes and not using them, it\u2019s pretty harmful for the environment.\u201dMs. Derby nodded. \u201cEvery year I get rid of four or five garbage bags of clothes. I don\u2019t even know how I accumulate them.\u201dWith unlimited options comes a kind of perverse pressure: There\u2019s no excuse to not look good. I discovered this myself in April, when I signed up for Unlimited. One major upside: Since enlisting, I\u2019ve purchased only one piece of clothing, a dress I initially rented through Unlimited. But on the app, I routinely went down the rabbit hole of comparing one potential rental to another, reading review after review, scrolling through top picks, new arrivals and categories like \u201cDress Spotlight\u201d and \u201cTrending: Statement Tops.\u201d I had to force myself to stop.It happened again in real life in August, when I visited Rent the Runway\u2019s New York showroom, a Willy Wonka-esque emporium for fashion fiends. Intending to be in and out in 20 minutes, I instead stayed for more than an hour.When I got there, a smiling greeter prompted me to sign up for a fitting room on an iPad, so I could spend time browsing and not standing in line. Salespeople \u2014 if they can be called that, since none of the merchandise had price tags \u2014 went out of their way to unload my arms as they filled with hangers.But when I got to where I was staying, I tried the dress on again and started sweating almost immediately. I ended up wearing a cotton dress I\u2019d owned for three years to the meeting. Later, I inelegantly stuffed the Marni into my suitcase and eventually sent it back to the warehouse unworn.Rent the Runway can\u2019t be expected to solve the paralysis of choice or irrationality that plagues some of us; if anything, its future plans will exacerbate those tendencies. Ms. Hyman wants customers to be able to borrow more items, from an ever-expanding library of brands, at any time they choose.\u201cThe vision is that within a few blocks of where all of our subscribers live, all over the country, our members have access to a magical closet that has inventory that\u2019s personalized to them, that they can access 24 hours a day,\u201d said Ms. Hyman. \u201cWe\u2019re building out the technology to make seamless access to that closet as delightful and frictionless as possible.\u201d She added, \u201cRent the Runway closets should feel as organic in your day as going to Starbucks.\u201dThe ephemeral, on-demand closets of Ms. Hyman\u2019s dreams would be something altogether different, and freeing. They would allow us to use our old-fashioned physical closets, and our time and energy, for something else.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Sears Plan to Get Out of Bankruptcy Has a Familiar Ring", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn its bankruptcy filing on Monday, Sears argued that, given enough time and less debt, it would be able to reverse the decades-long decline of its retail business.But the company\u2019s latest turnaround plan looks a lot like its previous turnaround plans: close unprofitable stores, sell properties and borrow more money from the company\u2019s chairman and largest investor, Edward S. Lampert.Missing from that plan was any explanation of how Sears would gain the ground it had lost to big-box stores like Walmart and the e-commerce giant Amazon. In 2005, Sears had 2 percent of all retail sales. It now accounts for less than 0.3 percent, according to Customer Growth Partners, a research firm.\u201cHonestly, Sears is essentially dead already,\u201d said Gerald L. Storch, the former chief executive of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us and Hudson\u2019s Bay, the parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue. \u201cMaybe it limps along for while. But it is walking zombie.\u201dAs part of its Chapter 11 reorganization plan, Sears says it will close 142 unprofitable stores, or about 20 percent of what remains of its once vast footprint that also includes the discount retailer Kmart. The company also plans to sell its Kenmore and Home Services brands.Those cuts would come on top of the 1,000 stores the company closed in the past decade, and the sale of brands like Lands\u2019 End, Craftsman and Sears Canada.Mr. Lampert, a hedge fund manager who has already lent the company about $2.5 billion, said he would extend another $300 million to keep the retailer operating in bankruptcy. The loan comes in addition to the more traditional financing from banks that Sears received on Monday.Mr. Lampert\u2019s hope is that by focusing only on a core group of 400 profitable stores, the company can stop hemorrhaging money and restore the confidence of its customers and vendors. Many suppliers have stopped advancing products to Sears on credit and are owed millions of dollars. Overall, Sears listed $11.3 billion in liabilities in its bankruptcy filing and $7 billion in assets.Industry analysts, investors and former retail executives said Sears\u2019s Chapter 11 filing is only a short stop on the way to liquidation.\u201cThere are not strong reasons to be optimistic,\u2019\u2019 said Alan Treadgold, a retail expert at PA Consulting. \u201cYou exit the stores that are not viable. You manage the debt. But it still leaves the fundamental question: What is the purpose of Sears?\u201dIn recent years, bankruptcy has not been kind to old-school retailers seeking a second life.Toys \u201cR\u201d Us had hoped to cut its debts and reorganize as a smaller, more nimble company when it filed a Chapter 11 case last September. But rather than keeping the company going, its lenders decided they could recoup more by putting up its toys in a fire sale and shutting down all its stores. The clothing chain Bon-Ton also liquidated earlier this year and closed all its stores.Sears could follow a similar path, particularly after Christmas when its stores have finished selling out their holiday inventory and will be less productive.The one wild card is Mr. Lampert, who has continued to sink money into the company despite long odds.In bankruptcy documents, Sears said Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge fund was willing to make the opening bid to essentially buy the company\u2019s 400 most viable stores and keep them going.In one filing, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Robert A. Riecker, said the hedge fund\u2019s \u201csupport has ensured that the company\u2019s doors remain open, and over 68,000 individuals remain employed.\u201dBut Mr. Lampert may have other reasons to make sure Sears keeps the lights on. He is the chairman of and a large investor in Seritage Growth Properties, a real estate company that owns 230 former Sears properties. Sears pays rent to Seritage and a liquidation could imperil that revenue.Since Sears sold those stores to Seritage in 2015, the value of many of its remaining stores has declined. Real estate analysts say many of these cavernous spaces are in struggling malls, making them unlikely to attract another large retailer or an ambitious redevelopment projects like office buildings or hotels.\u201cWhy Eddie is still in this is anybody\u2019s guess,\u2019\u2019 said David D. Tawil, a co-founder of Maglan Capital, a New York hedge fund, that makes investments in the debt of troubled companies but has not bought debt issued by Sears because it posed too much risk.\u201cWe are dealing with a new age in retail bankruptcies, and Sears is the weakest player in the market,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Tawil added. \u201dIf it makes it out of bankruptcy, it would be an astounding accomplishment.\u201dAs far as retail sector is concerned, analysts do not expect the company\u2019s bankruptcy filing to have much of an effect on its competitors. Competitors like Walmart, Kohl\u2019s and Home Depot took market share away from Sears and Kmart years ago. And rents and occupancy have fallen sharply in malls where Sears anchor stores have struggled.Mr. Trump blamed the retailer\u2019s decline on poor management, saying the company was \u201cimproperly run for many years.\u201d The president did not mention that his Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was on the Sears board for about a decade before stepping down to join the White House administration.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Polarizing New President, Jair Bolsonaro, in His Own Words", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJair Bolsonaro\u2019s climb to power has been marked by divisive rhetoric and offensive speech that has thrilled followers and appalled critics in equal measure. The far-right former army captain\u2019s rise has left some baffled. Mr. Bolsonaro served seven consecutive terms in Congress, with little to show for his time there; very few of his bills were approved.But many Brazilians, angered by their country\u2019s economic crisis, soaring violence and corruption scandals, interpreted his long list of caustic remarks as blunt but bracingly honest talk from a man willing to say \u2014 and do \u2014 whatever was necessary to bring about the change they craved. Mr. Bolsonaro has described having a female child as a \u201cweakness,\u201d and has said he would not treat or pay women the same as men in the workplace. \u201cBecause women get more labor rights than men, meaning they get maternity leave, the employer prefers to hire men \u2026 I would not employ [women equally]. But there are a lot of competent women out there.\u201dIn 2014, he told a fellow lawmaker:\u201cI would not rape you because you are not worthy of it.\u201dIn 2013, he said that he would \u201crather have a son who is an addict than a son who is gay,\u201d and that he was \u201cproud to be homophobic.\u201d In June 2011, he said he would \u201crather his son die in a car accident than be gay,\u201d adding:\u201cIf a gay couple came to live in my building, my property will lose value. If they walk around holding hands, kissing, it will lose value! No one says that out of fear of being pinned as homophobe.\u201dIn April 2017, Mr. Bolsonaro spoke about visiting traditional Afro-Brazilian communities. He described the weight of the residents using the word \u201carrobas,\u201d an outdated unit used to weigh cattle and agricultural products.\u201cThe lightest Afro-descendant there weighed seven \u2018arrobas\u2019. They don\u2019t do anything. They are not even good for procreation.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro advocates it:\u201cI am in favor of torture \u2014 you know that. And the people are in favor of it, too.In April 2016, when President Dilma Rousseff\u2019s impeachment was put to a vote in Congress, Mr. Bolsonaro dedicated his vote to a colonel who ran a torture center during the country\u2019s military dictatorship in which Ms. Rousseff was tortured in her youth:\u201cIn memory of Col. Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, the terror of Dilma Rousseff \u2026 I vote YES.\u201dAfter criticizing Brazil\u2019s government during a 1999 interview, Mr. Bolsonaro was asked whether he would shut down Congress if he were president. He said:\u201cThere is no doubt. I would perform a coup on the same day. [Congress] doesn\u2019t work. And I am sure that at least 90 percent of the population would celebrate and applaud because it doesn\u2019t work. The Congress today is useless \u2026 lets do the coup already. Let\u2019s go straight to the dictatorship.\u201dIn the same interview he also said:\u201cElections won\u2019t change anything in this country. Unfortunately, it will only change on the day that we break out in civil war here and do the job that the military regime didn\u2019t do: killing 30,000. If some innocent people die, that\u2019s fine. In every war, innocent people die. I will even be happy if I die as long as 30,000 others go with me.\u201d At a rally in S\u00e3o Paulo on Oct. 21, Mr. Bolsonaro vowed to imprison or exile his political opponents once in office:\u201cThis time, the cleanup will be even greater. This group, if they want to stay, they will have to abide by our laws. Either they stay out or they will go to jail.\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro has said he would curtail efforts to protect the environment and indigenous land:\u201cWe are going to fuse together the Ministry of Agriculture with the Ministry of the Environment \u2026 We need to put a stop to the demarcation of indigenous land \u2026 indigenous people want to rent out the land, they want to be able to do business, they want electricity, a dentist to remove the stumps of teeth from their mouths \u2026 indigenous people are human beings like us. They don\u2019t want to be used for political purposes.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro has also said that there were far too many indigenous reservations in the Amazon:\u201cOur Amazon is like a child with chickenpox, every dot you see is an indigenous reservation \u2026 and the Brazilian people applaud [demarcation of indigenous land]. Look at these people, no political strategy!\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Four Thousand Miles for the W\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "Not long ago, the Seattle Seahawks looked like a budding dynasty. With the franchise trying to rebuild on the fly, a trip to London came at the worst possible time. Or was it the best?The N.F.L. told the Seattle Seahawks last winter that they would face the Raiders in London on Oct. 14.Back then, months before the rest of the 2018 schedule came out, the Seahawks could never have anticipated that last weekend\u2019s trip to London would come at a pivotal juncture for the franchise: Their record stood at 2-3 after a tough loss to the Los Angeles Rams.Then it was time to spread the gospel of American football overseas. Instead of heading about 670 miles south to Oakland, Calif., the Seahawks would fly nearly 5,000 miles to England, eight time zones away.Sending an N.F.L. team overseas is a herculean venture. Players need passports, the equipment staff sends supplies months in advance, the travel director has to navigate an unfamiliar airport and hotel, and the trainers will often modify the players\u2019 diet and sleep regimens. Then there is the equipment, some 21,000 pounds of it, that must be transported.Maybe, with pressure mounting, a venture far away was exactly what this franchise needed.The Seahawks, who had a home game the Sunday before they left for London, practiced the next Tuesday and Wednesday, then left for London on Wednesday night, accompanied by a New York Times reporter and photographer.In the locker room, the mood was loose. Cornerback Neiko Thorpe challenged all comers in table tennis. At his locker, he had a Nintendo Switch gaming console that he was taking on the trip.\u201cHe was who he was, and I think that speaks more volumes about the fun or the type of person that he was that he brought to this locker room more so than anything,\u201d receiver Doug Baldwin said.Their warm comments were a reminder of how difficult it is to keep winning teams together in the N.F.L. The Seahawks were poised to win their second consecutive Super Bowl when, with the ball near the goal line, they opted to pass instead of hand off the ball to Lynch. The interception and loss that followed, against the New England Patriots, halted any talk of a dynasty and left some players, including Lynch, bitter.Now they had to defeat Lynch.They boarded a chartered Airbus A340-600 that included 45 sleeping pods in first class for the veteran players. Coach Pete Carroll sat in the first row of business class along with other coaches. Rookies and members of the practice squad sat behind them. About half the 170 passengers sat in coach, which was filled with giddy chatter before takeoff. The menu was the same for everyone: beef filet, Cajun chicken or herb roasted salmon.For this trip, Ramsden reversed the program: He told players to sleep as much as possible on the flight so when they arrived in London on Thursday afternoon, they would have enough energy to stay up until 9 or 10 p.m. and then get a full night\u2019s rest.\u201cWe try to protect their circadian rhythms as much as possible,\u201d Ramsden said.Ramsden\u2019s staff prepared sleep kits for \u201cmental alertness.\u201d They included blackout eye masks. Some players took melatonin or Ambien, while others used earbuds that played the sounds of wind and rushing water to induce sleep.A few people slept on the floor or were splayed across a row of seats. Wagner watched game video on his iPad. A half-dozen others, including the twins Shaquill and Shaquem Griffin, played the card game Spades in the bar area in first class. They trash-talked, laughed and threw $20 bills to the winners. They seemed unaware that Carroll, who tries to give his players room to be themselves, was sleeping in a seat a few feet away.The urgency of the moment seemed intangible \u2014 and maybe that was the point.The players and coaches rolled off the plane on Thursday about 1:30 p.m. Some players struggled to stay awake, like defensive end Frank Clark, who draped his thick coat over his head.Buses took them to the Grove, a resort in Watford, north of London, that features grass tennis courts and a golf course.It has plenty of amenities, but nothing was left to chance. The team shipped 1,150 rolls of athletic tape, two tons of medical supplies, 350 power adapters, 500 pairs of shoes and 240 pairs of socks. In all, the Seahawks had shipped 21,000 pounds of gear and products worth $770,000. Some items \u2014 toiletries, snacks, bottled water, Gorilla Glue, lighters (to burn off loose threads) and cayenne pepper, which when mixed with talcum powder keeps players\u2019 feet warm \u2014 were ordered from the Amazon U.K. website.In the evening, the players let off some steam at a Topgolf facility. Broken into groups of four, they tried to hit balls into giant holes to score points, and took grief every time they were wildly off target.\u201cIs that the best you can do?\u201d Wagner yelled at Austin Calitro, another linebacker.Thorpe, a cornerback, dug into a pile of chicken wings and posted videos on social media. \u201cThis is how I imagined it,\u201d he said of the team\u2019s first day in England.Wilson was in the first booth and seemed to be taking his swings seriously as the three veteran offensive linemen who sat with him checked their cellphones.Then, finally, it was time to return to the hotel, for smoothies, bottles of water and sleep.After several hours of meetings and a practice, some veterans left on a coach bus for Covent Garden and their only chance to see central London. Another bus took about a dozen younger players, with money in their pockets and no family in tow, to Watford Junction station, where they rode the train into London.At a loss where to go, a few English rugby players, who watched the Seahawks practice that day, helped them find Nike Town at Oxford Circus.At the front of the store, mannequins dressed in Seahawks gear stood next to racks of N.F.L. jerseys and shirts. \u201cMan, there\u2019s a lot of Patriots stuff here,\u201d Azeem Victor, a linebacker on the practice squad, said. As he looked for a soccer jersey, two shoppers separately asked him for help, assuming he worked there.Italian tourists asked to take photographs with the players, which made Rashaad Penny, a rookie running back, feel like a rock star. He soon video-chatted with somebody to describe what had happened.Penny and the other players were enjoying the chance to get away from the endless meetings and practices, and the expectations of their coaches and veterans. Lavon Coleman, another running back, stood wide-eyed in the street as people streamed past. He asked strangers for directions and food recommendations. He posed for pictures with Raiders fans from Denmark.\u201cI like that I can be myself,\u201d he said.A group of players went looking for food, but didn\u2019t seem interested in challenging their taste buds. They ended up at a Shake Shack. Linemen Jordan Roos and Elijah Nkansah went to a pub. Surprised by how warm their pints of Guinness were, they went to another pub and ordered lagers that were chilled to their satisfaction. Several more pints were consumed before, with the clock ticking toward the midnight curfew, they made their way to Euston station. There, they bumped into Brett Hundley, the backup quarterback, and several others. The players filled half a train car and compared notes on their first glimpses of London on a commuter train back to Watford Junction.Carroll takes his players to the stadium the day before a road game so they can visualize conditions ahead of time. At 1:30 p.m., the Seahawks drove to Wembley, where they saw the locker room, which had been set up with their gear, and the field, the most famous soccer pitch in England. Worried about the slickness of the grass, Erik Kennedy, the equipment manager, had longer screw-in cleats available for the players.Carroll and the team returned to the Grove around 4 p.m. Wilson, Wagner, Baldwin and a few other players got ready to meet two dozen fans in a session that was broadcast on Facebook Live.In the green room beforehand, the players signed footballs and helmets. Wilson, mindful of his public image, asked a producer if there was anything to worry about. He was assured that the talk was in front of friendly fans.At the event, Baldwin did not sugarcoat his description of the team, even in front of his coach.\u201cPete wouldn\u2019t want to call it this, but it\u2019s a retooling, a process we\u2019re all going through,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing a great job of bringing the young guys along, of establishing what our culture is again, re-establishing it so the young guys can buy into it. It\u2019s been a difficult process but I think, moving forward, we\u2019re going to be really good.\u201dN.F.L. players do whatever they can to relax in the early hours on game day.Some Seahawks packed, others looked at yet more video.D.J. Fluker, the team\u2019s enormous guard, found solace in the players\u2019 lounge, where he sat alone playing the Madden football video game. Fluker, who filled his roster with current and former stars like Antonio Brown and Ronnie Lott, played a virtual foe. He flicked through offensive formations, which he said were similar to those in N.F.L. playbooks. He liked the distraction.\u201cIt takes away my anxiety,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I think about football too much, I\u2019ll get antsy. You can be overprepared.\u201dHe didn\u2019t need to worry. From the opening whistle of the game, the Seahawks seemed to have every advantage. The meticulous planning, the sleep kits, the choreographed downtime and maybe even the pints of Guinness seemed to help steady the players at a fragile moment. Or maybe they were just better.The defense stifled Lynch, the Raiders running back, while Wilson effortlessly led the Seahawks\u2019 offense up and down the field. Final score: 27-3.As the Seahawks piled back into their locker room, now 3-3 and brimming with confidence, one player yelled, \u201cFour thousand miles for the dub,\u201d a reference to a W, a win.Inside the locker room, before the news media were allowed in, the players were screaming and slapping shoulders. Rainn Wilson, an actor on the television comedy \u201cThe Office\u201d and a big Seahawks fan, was brought in to address the rowdy players. \u201cThat was Seahawks football today,\u201d he yelled as players whooped it up.Then Carroll, his voice hoarse, thanked the staff that organized the trip, \u201cthe whole thing.\u201dAt 1:30 a.m., the Seahawks departed Gatwick Airport. Coleman, sitting in economy class, collected piles of pillows and built a bed on the floor in front of an emergency exit.The flight home was far quieter than the one to London. The staff worked overtime during the four-day trip and many of them were asleep before takeoff. Exhausted after three hours of high-powered football, the players lumbered into their pods.Nearly 10 hours later, the plane landed in Seattle. Carroll spoke over the plane\u2019s intercom, announcing a day off for everyone who did not need to see the training staff. Cheers erupted.He called it a \u201cgreat week,\u201d and then said, \u201cTo everybody, thanks a lot, appreciate ya, love ya, bye.\u201dThe bliss lasted roughly 12 hours. In midafternoon, word spread that Allen, the team\u2019s owner and a co-founder of Microsoft, had died.In football and in life, even the best trips come to an end.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "2001: When the Internet Was, Um, Over?", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byyesterday in stylesAfter the 2000 dot-com crash and the Sept. 11 attacks, it seemed as if the era of cocky young Silicon Valley techies minting easy millions was over for good. Ha.So let\u2019s go easy on this 2001 Styles article that declared, well, not the end of the internet, precisely, but an end to the idea that the internet was culturally relevant and cool. The dot-com crash of 2000, and the Sept. 11 attacks the next year, marked \u201cthe next step after the bursting of the dot-com economic bubble,\u201d wrote the article\u2019s author, John Schwartz. Those twin cataclysms led to \u201cthe bursting of the cultural bubble, the end of the nerd as a crossover hit, of the I.P.O. zillionaire as role model to college students.\u201d It bears noting that Mark Zuckerberg would enroll at Harvard the following year. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.A generation of young entrepreneurs who had ridden the \u201cWorld Wide Web\u201d to overnight fortunes and rock star status saw their paper millions vanish overnight as the Nasdaq index collapsed by 78 percent. They lost a lot more than money, Mr. Schwartz argued. \u201cNot much more than a year ago, boosters of the New Economy and their true believers in the press were claiming to have changed all the rules.\u201d Mr. Schwartz quoted a New York Magazine article by Michael Wolff, \u201chimself a failed dot-com executive,\u201d who had written, \u201call it takes to make otherworldly riches is the will and desire.\u201d Indeed, it was not enough for the young web plutocrats to make money; \u201cthey had to make history,\u201d Mr. Schwartz wrote. \u201cNow they themselves are history.\u201dHenry Blodget, a former tech industry analyst \u201cwho became famous for predicting early that Amazon.com would reach $400 a share\u201d \u2014 jeepers!\u2014 announced that he was \u201ctaking a buyout and leaving Merrill Lynch at the grand old age of 35,\u201d and was also writing a book, Mr. Schwartz noted. Ellen DeGeneres even attempted a sitcom about a failed dot-com executive, which became another dot-bomb. \u201cFor the most part,\u201d Mr. Schwartz wrote, \u201cthe flood of dot-com failure stories is being met with a national yawn.\u201dCollege students who had spent the \u201990s with \u201cvisions of Testarossas dancing in their heads\u201d as they hoped to emulate geek stars like Marc Andreessen of Netscape were now saying that they want \u201cfulfilling jobs, not just ways of earning money,\u201d according to a University of Maryland professor quoted in the article. This made sense in an economy where many skeptics assumed the days of easy money were gone for good. As the writer Thomas Frank, a fierce critic of New Economy values, was quoted saying, \u201cthe Dow isn\u2019t going to go to 36,000, and the dot-coms aren\u2019t going to come back.\u201dBut with the wisdom of hindsight, it is clear that 2001 was not the end of internet culture, but rather, the end of the beginning of internet culture. Today\u2019s young tech moguls \u2014 like Facebook\u2019s $60 billion man, Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 are not only among the richest people in the world, they are also Beyonc\u00e9-level stars in the eyes of the starry-eyed postgraduates who flock to tech\u2019s promised land, hoping, like the characters in HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d to carve out their slice of the future.When contacted last week about the story, he thanked me for the opportunity to stay humble, but added: \u201cAs the story predicted, a new generation of companies has arisen and changed the world since that story ran: It includes Facebook, Twitter, Uber and Theranos.\u201d He continued, \u201cif there\u2019s a lesson in taking a new look at this old story, it has to be to never bet against greed, and never bet on a cultural shift that requires tech companies to grow a conscience.\u201dAdvertisement"}

She played as a child, then moved to soccer and basketball when she realized she wasn\u2019t very good. But she had promised Mr. Kunovac and Ms. Sorokko she would get out on the court with them. They could move from holding her hand to tweaking her grip.\u201cI need two coaches,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s how bad I am.\u201d\u201cFirst thing we\u2019re going to do is 20 laps around the court,\u201d Mr. Kunovac said. Ms. Peet, a 46-year-old mother of three, replied with an obscenity.The Racquet Club\u2019s tennis bubble was puffily futuristic and starkly lit, with thwacks and grunts coming from the other courts. Ms. Peet has a tennis grunt, too; it sounds like the scream of a woman who has stepped on her cat.She warmed up with some halfhearted stretches while Ms. Sorokko rewrapped her racket in gleaming white tape. Then Mr. Kunovac started her on some groundstrokes. \u201cI\u2019m really excited to torture you,\u201d he said. That\u2019s when the groin shot happened.Once he\u2019d recovered, they went back to forehand groundstrokes. Ms. Peet struggled with footing. \u201cThe second the forehand comes, I\u2019m like, it\u2019s over,\u201d she said. She has decided that a weak forehand, which she has, and a strong backhand, which she also has, \u201cis the sign of a true neurotic.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s really horrible to love something and suck at it so much,\u201d Ms. Peet said, as she went to fill a paper cup with water. When she had emptied it, she repurposed the cup as a dunce cap.Next, she practiced volleys. Her arms were like spaghetti, sometimes overcooked, sometimes a lot more al dente. Still, her net game was solid and the ball smacked from racket to racket more than a dozen times before a passing shot ended the volley.In her episode of the \u201cRomanoffs,\u201d Ms. Peet plays a woman who is about to become a grandmother, and while she doesn\u2019t look it, maybe she was feeling it. \u201cI am seriously out of breath,\u201d she said, lying down on the court to rest. \u201cIf I have a heart attack, tell my kids I love them.\u201d\u201cBeyond incredible,\u201d Mr. Kunovac said. \u201cThe costumes were amazing.\u201d\u201cIt was hard to go to the bathroom,\u201d Ms. Sorokko said.And no, Ms. Peet can\u2019t spill any finale details except to say that she has a lot of anxiety about keeping it a secret.As she stripped down to a T-shirt, Mr. Kunovac and Ms. Sorokko rallied with each other. Ms. Sorokko hit a couple of trick shots through her legs. Ms. Peet hit the water cooler.It was time to practice her serve. \u201cOh God,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little hard because I\u2019m shortsighted.

But just how many Hispanics will show up at the ballot box remains a big question, and it appears that most in the state have not been contacted directly by campaigns.Perhaps nowhere is the Hispanic vote so critical this year as in the 10th District, surrounding Modesto in the Central Valley, where Josh Harder, a Democrat, is running a competitive bid to unseat the incumbent Republican, Representative Jeff Denham.

{"Headline": "Vatican Faces Modern-Day Suffragists, Demanding Right to Vote", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVATICAN CITY \u2014 Two modern-day American suffragists had a plan.Vatican synods are held every few years. Women have emerged as a major concern of this one, which opened earlier this month and focuses on how the church can better minister to today\u2019s youth in an era of emptying pews.\u201cThe presence of women in the church, the role of women in the church,\u201d has been repeatedly raised, in the synod\u2019s plenary meeting and within smaller working groups, said Sister Sally Marie Hodgdon, the superior general of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Chambery, and a synod participant. \u201cThe youth bring it up, as have some of the bishops and cardinals.\u201d\u201cClearly,\u201d she added, the issue of women will be in the final document, which will be voted on Saturday.This year, though, two men who are not ordained but are the superiors general of their respective religious orders have been granted the right to vote. Sister Hodgdon, too, is a superior general, but she has no voting rights.The petition to allow female superiors general a synod vote was a \u201cstrategic\u201d move toward their more equal participation in church matters, Ms. McElwee said, adding that she realized it confirmed the \u201cultimate fear\u201d of some clerics who see it as a step down a \u201cslippery slope that could eventually lead to women\u2019s ordination\u201d as priests.Such ordination, Ms. McElwee said, was \u201cthe last door that\u2019s closed to women,\u201d though there are many doors in between. Church teaching says that women can\u2019t be priests because Jesus chose only men as his apostles.Those numbers have not raised the loud warning bells in the Catholic Church that they should have, critics say.\u201cFor the first time in history women are leaving at greater rates than men,\u201d said Ms. Rose-Milavec. \u201cThat is a deep dive.\u201dVoice of Faith, based in Liechtenstein, is pushing for women to gain full leadership roles in the Catholic Church. It has urged the close-knit group of cardinals who advise the pope on various issues that it should establish a special advisory board for women, Ms. Dankova said.The question of their involvement in the church, she added, \u201cis too complex and it cannot be expected to be somehow solved on the side without a concentrated attention and without the collaboration with women themselves.\u201dThat suggestion has fallen on deaf ears, although some top prelates at the synod have been vocal in their support of women.On Wednesday, speaking to reporters at a daily Vatican briefing, Cardinal Reinhard Marx, chairman of the German Bishop\u2019s Conference, said that the issue of women\u2019s roles in the church was \u201cimportant for the entire church,\u201d which must understand the evolution of women\u2019s equality as a gift from God.\u201cWe would be foolish not to make use of the potential of women,\u201d Cardinal Marx said. \u201cThank God we are not that stupid.\u201dMale religious superiors at the synod have also been supportive, and the umbrella groups of both male and female superiors general have drafted a concrete proposal to allow women superiors to participate as voting members in future synods. If ratified by their respective boards, the proposal would be presented to the pope, Sister Hodgdon said.After living in Rome for eight years, Sister Hodgdon, an American, said she has learned that the ways of the Church took time. Female superior generals were not likely to get the right to vote in this synod, she conceded. \u201cBut do I believe it will happen for the next one? Yes, I really do believe that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Suspiria\u2019: Stream the Original and 8 Other Italian Horror Classics", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany of us spend the Halloween season revisiting our favorite horror movies or tracking down hidden gems. Often, our watch lists are filled with the familiar names of directors who have shaped the genre from North America: Carpenter, Craven, Cronenberg, Romero. But the release this weekend of Luca Guadagnino\u2019s remake of \u201cSuspiria\u201d recalls another group of filmmakers who were just as influential: Italians working in the 1960s, \u201970s and \u201980s, whose fingerprints can be seen all over recent horror films like \u201cHereditary,\u201d \u201cThe Nun\u201d and \u201cApostle.\u201dItalian horror borrows heavily from giallo, or the Italian thriller \u2014 a genre term that repurposes the Italian word for yellow, a reference to the cheap paperback crime novels of postwar Italy. To the giallo, Italian horror directors added surreal and supernatural elements: masked stalkers, witches\u2019 covens and blood by the bucketful. As important, they also added distinctive stylistic flourishes: Their bold lighting, bright colors, jarring scores and unconventional narrative structures defied the norms of American and British horror.Some of the films were so over-the-top and gruesome that until recent years, the only versions available to most audiences were heavily edited \u2014 if available at all. Here are a few suggestions on some of the best films from that Golden Age of Italian horror, all of which are available to stream. (Streaming service information was good as of late October.)Before seeing the remake by Luca Guadagnino, there is arguably no better place to enter the realm of Italian horror film than Dario Argento\u2019s original \u201cSuspiria.\u201d Blending the supernatural with elements of the so-called giallo films that defined the early part of his career, Argento creates a phantasmagoric fairy tale that is equal parts beautiful and horrific. The plot, in which a ballerina named Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) encounters murder and witchcraft at a German dance academy, is simple enough, but the lavish set designs and Rube Goldberg-like murder sequences offer complex and sensual thrills. Aided by the cinematographer Luciano Tovoli and the prog rock score by Goblin, Argento pushes past the starker aesthetics of German Expressionism that influenced so much of the horror in this period, presenting instead a chic surrealist Pop Art nightmare.Irene Miracle in \u201cInferno.\u201dA thematic sequel to \u201cSuspiria,\u201d this second installment in Argento\u2019s Three Mothers trilogy didn\u2019t earn the same acclaim upon release as its predecessor. But it has since come to be regarded as one of the filmmaker\u2019s finer works, at least visually. \u201cInferno\u201d centers on the search by Mark Elliot (Leigh McCloskey) for his sister, Rose (Irene Miracle), who has disappeared from her New York apartment building, which is inhabited by a witch. While \u201cInferno\u201d builds up the mythology of Argento\u2019s Three Mothers, its plot isn\u2019t as engaging as that of \u201cSuspiria.\u201d Where \u201cInferno\u201d excels is in its visual effects, for which Argento invited his mentor, the Italian horror director Mario Bava, to assist. An underwater ballroom scene shot in a water tank is the highlight of the film and one of the best moments in all of Italian horror. Guadagnino\u2019s \u201cSuspiria\u201d remake incorporates some elements of \u201cInferno,\u201d making this essential prior viewing as well.Cristina Marsillach in \u201cOpera.\u201dBarbara Steele in \u201cBlack Sunday.\u201dOne of Italy\u2019s foremost horror movie sensations, Mario Bava\u2019s \u201cBlack Sunday,\u201d is often considered by many horror aficionados to be the essential gothic horror feature. Centered on a resurrected witch (Barbara Steele) who was burned at the stake alongside her vampiric lover, \u201cBlack Sunday\u201d was inspired by the Nikolai Gogol story \u201cViy\u201d and by the classic Universal Pictures films \u201cDracula\u201d (1931) and \u201cFrankenstein\u201d (1931). But where the Universal films managed to achieve a lot with very little gore, \u201cBlack Sunday\u201d is surprisingly gruesome for the period, leading to a number of banned versions and edits over the years. The influence of Bava\u2019s aesthetics can be seen on the Dracula films of the \u201960s and \u201970s starring Christopher Lee, on Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cDracula\u201d (1992), and on films as recent as Corin Hardy\u2019s \u201cThe Nun\u201d (2018), proving the broad influence of Italy\u2019s early films in the genre.Mario Bava also left his mark on his son Lamberto, who proved his knack for the sinister and salacious as well. While the senior Bava had a more classical approach to horror, one born from literature, Lamberto Bava\u2019s films are punk rock \u2014 popcorn movies with imagery and attitude derived from comic books. Structurally, \u201cDemons\u201d utilizes a film within the film as a gateway into the supernatural. When the movie theater audience begins turning into demons as a result of a cursed mask in the theater lobby, \u201cDemons\u201d becomes a gore fest so repulsive and slick with blood that it\u2019s a true marvel of practical effects. Set to a soundtrack featuring Billy Idol, M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce and Rick Springfield, \u201cDemons\u201d is a fun and occasionally nauseating viewing experience that still feels shocking, even by contemporary standards.Director Michele Soavi finds the sweet spot between Mario Bava\u2019s occult curiosity and Lamberto Bava\u2019s gory excess for this film set in a gothic cathedral that was built over the mass grave of Satanists. \u201cThe Church,\u201d which is the second sequel to \u201cDemons,\u201d takes a page from that film by trapping people in a single location and following their efforts to keep the evil contained. Inspired by M.R. James\u2019s \u201cThe Treasure of Abbot Thomas,\u201d the film provides more than mere shock value though, offering commentary on the nature of innocence and on the generational consequences of sin. Despite the heavy Bava influence, Soavi, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Argento\u2019s, deploys his mentor\u2019s affinity for elaborate architecture and the musical talents of Goblin, who score the film alongside Keith Emerson, Fabio Pignatelli and Philip Glass. Coming near the end of Italy\u2019s Golden Age of horror film production, \u201cThe Church\u201d feels like a culmination, featuring some of the country\u2019s most prominent voices in the genre.Alongside Mario Bava and Dario Argento, the best-known director in Italian horror is the \u201cGodfather of Gore,\u201d Lucio Fulci. While Bava, Argento and their families often collaborated with one another, Fulci stood apart for most of his career, critical of Argento\u2019s success. Like Argento, Fulci was inspired by George A. Romero\u2019s \u201cDawn of the Dead\u201d (1978), and he created his own follow-up, \u201cZombi 2,\u201d since retitled \u201cZombie\u201d in hopes of finding similar success within the zombie subgenre. Taking place on a Caribbean island and one of the few post-Romero zombie films explore the Haitian roots of the concept, \u201cZombie\u201d follows Anne Bowles (Tisa Farrow), who alongside a journalist and a couple on a sailing trip, journeys to an island to find her missing father. What ensues is a showcase of Fulci\u2019s reputation for blood and guts, a talent that brought the filmmaker international attention and controversy. While the story is perhaps not unique, \u201cZombie\u201d is the most accessible of Fulci\u2019s films, which went on to get only more experimental and grisly.Daniela Doria in \u201cCity of the Living Dead.\u201dThe first installment of Fulci\u2019s \u201cGates of Hell Trilogy,\u201d \u201cCity of the Living Dead\u201d is narratively unfocused but filled with the filmmaker\u2019s unbridled ambition to shock audiences and make them squirm. Taking place both in the fictional American village of Dunwich and in New York City, the film shows what happens when one of the three gates of hell are opened and the dead begin to walk the Earth. While the film\u2019s title may suggest otherwise, this isn\u2019t a zombie film. Instead, it\u2019s a hellish take on the end of the world. The key to appreciating this film, and much of Fulci\u2019s filmography, is abandoning the need for answers, or for a plot that proceeds logically. While so much \u201980s horror came down to formula, Fulci\u2019s work never made it that simple, relying instead on a wide range of horror subgenres and the idea that the most startling horror stories aren\u2019t able to be categorized or confined. In this case, neither are internal organs.A scene from \u201cThe Beyond.\u201dConsidered by many horror filmmakers and critics to be Fulci\u2019s finest film \u2014 his \u201cSuspiria\u201d \u2014 \u201cThe Beyond\u201d is a journey into surrealism, one that takes a tour of the American South by way of nightmare logic. Set in Louisiana, the film follows Liza Merril (Catriona MacColl), who inherits a hotel that houses the second gate of hell. More of a mystery than \u201cCity of the Living Dead,\u201d this second installment in Fulci\u2019s \u201cGates of Hell\u201d trilogy is slower paced but hits harder when it comes to his infamous knack for mutilating bodies \u2014 notably in one scene involving acid, and another involving flesh-eating spiders. While Fulci\u2019s work has often been defined as pulp schlock, here he blends it with an artful approach that creates parallels between the filmmaker and the artist believed to be a warlock, whose lynching sets off the events of this horrific and beautiful film.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "In August, amid a leadership shakeup, the Australian government blocked Huawei, a Chinese company whose technology underpins mobile broadband for about half of all Australians, from building the country\u2019s future 5G networks.The ban was made under the pretext of protecting national security, yet there is no evidence that Huawei gear is insecure. Because it is headquartered in China, Huawei has undergone more scrutiny than any other ICT supplier in the world. In several markets, including the U.K., its source code is reviewed by independent security experts. In the 31 years since Huawei\u2019s founding, no public evidence of wrongdoing has ever come to light. Canberra\u2019s decision to ban the company was purely political.Australian citizens will be paying for that decision for decades to come. 5G will form the basis of future broadband networks. By keeping a leading 5G provider out of its market, Australia has reduced the country\u2019s supply of telecommunications infrastructure just as demand for 5G is starting to grow. Basic economics dictates that when supply drops, costs rise. Perhaps that is why Americans live with the second-highest prices in the world for mobile phone services. In the United States, 90 percent of wireless infrastructure sales are made by just two companies, Ericsson and Nokia. Meanwhile, the quality of U.S. mobile service measured by download speeds is ranked 61st in the world, after Chile, Egypt and Peru.National security obviously takes precedence over download speeds. But if security is the goal, banning telecom suppliers on the basis of geographic origin makes no sense. Today\u2019s telecommunications industry is transnational and borderless. Threats can originate anywhere. Programmable code can be implanted virtually in hardware and software, allowing malicious actors to spy or launch a cyberattack. Unauthorized functionality can compromise the product of any company, anywhere in the world.While no evidence exists that Huawei has been compromised by the Chinese government or any other actors, the United States, by contrast, has a long track record of modifying products to achieve its goals. From the 1940s until the early 1990s, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) rigged encryption systems sold by Crypto AG, a Swiss company, enabling the agency to read the coded diplomatic and military traffic of more than 120 countries. Later that decade, it reduced the level of security in non-U.S. versions of internet browsers and email programs made by Lotus Notes, Netscape and Microsoft to make files encrypted with those programs easy to decrypt. More recently, the NSA intercepted Cisco routers and covertly installed spyware on them before they were shipped to customers. The agency\u2019s ongoing Bullrun program places back doors into commercially available cryptographic software and hardware, or weakens the encryption so that the NSA can break the code. Australia\u2019s government does not trust Huawei, or China, or any Chinese company. Nor should they \u2014 in the digital domain, no one should be trusted. Negotiating arms treaties with the Soviet Union, former U.S. President Ronald Regan said that the best approach was to \u201ctrust but verify.\u201d Today, smart governments will dispense with trust and proceed straight to verification. Instead of pointlessly banning individual companies, they will establish comprehensive risk-mitigation procedures based on global best practices. These include hiring independent security experts to review source code and monitoring supply chains for breaches. Any other approach creates an illusion of security that actually increases risk. The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}

{"Headline": "U.S. Credit Card Giants Flout India\u2019s New Law on Personal Data", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 When the clock struck midnight in Delhi at the end of Monday, Visa, Mastercard and American Express were suddenly in violation of the law every time an Indian swiped a credit or debit card.The spark for the current fight is a new regulation, issued in April and in effect starting Tuesday, that requires payments companies to store all information about transactions involving Indians solely on computers in the country. The rule and the hubbub over it are part of a debate over a concept known as \u201cdata localization,\u201d in which a country places restrictions on data as a way to gain better control over it and potentially curb the power of international companies. American firms have lobbied hard against data localization rules around the world.In India, Visa, Mastercard and American Express, as well as other financial players like Amazon and PayPal, said they needed more time to comply with the order by the country\u2019s banking regulator, the Reserve Bank of India.The companies told the R.B.I. that their fraud detection and other data processing systems were distributed on machines across the world and could not be quickly redesigned to work in India alone. As an alternative, they offered to store copies of the Indian data in the country for easy access by regulators, tax authorities and law enforcement.But the R.B.I. would have none of it. In recent phone calls to the top Indian executives of the major payments companies and in letters to the companies last week, the banking regulator warned that it would take action, including imposing fines, if they missed the Monday night deadline.Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, said the payments companies were frustrated with the regulators. \u201cThey refuse to sit down and have a discussion,\u201d said Dr. Aghi, whose policy group counts the head of Mastercard on its board.Spokesmen for Visa and American Express declined to comment on their response to the local storage rule. Representatives of Mastercard and the R.B.I. did not respond to multiple requests for comment.Amazon, which operates an India-only payments service that uses elements of its global technology platform, said in a statement: \u201cCompliance with local laws and regulation is a top priority for us in all the countries we operate in. We continue to work closely with the regulator towards this.\u201dIts policy changed as other arms of the Indian government \u2014 spurred by both a privacy ruling from the Supreme Court and India-first nationalists in the governing Bharatiya Janata Party \u2014 had begun deliberating over much bigger changes to the country\u2019s data, e-commerce and privacy laws.India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has portrayed himself abroad as a pro-business leader who welcomes foreign investment. At the same time, the right wing of his party has pushed him to adopt more protectionist, India-first policies to appeal to voters, and law enforcement officials have urged him to make sure they can easily get data on residents when they need it.The Trump administration and the bipartisan India caucus of the United States Senate have both urged India to reconsider its data localization campaign, in part because India\u2019s own outsourcing companies depend on moving data across borders to offer their services.On Friday, the co-chairmen of the India caucus, Senators John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, wrote to Mr. Modi warning that data localization \u201cwill have negative impacts on the ability of companies to do business in India, may undermine your own economic goals and will likely not improve the security of Indian citizens\u2019 data.\u201dDr. Aghi, who has helped American financial firms press their case with the Indian government, said top executives of the big payments companies were summoned to a meeting on Wednesday with B. P. Kanungo, who oversees regulation of payments at the R.B.I.At that meeting, the payments companies asked for 12 more months to fully localize Indian financial data. But R.B.I. officials insisted that the companies meet the Monday night deadline.In a follow-up letter to India\u2019s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, Dr. Aghi said the R.B.I. had improperly suggested that the foreign financial firms seek assistance from iSpirt, a technology think tank in Bangalore with close ties to the government and Indian financial-services players.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sears, the Original Everything Store, Files for Bankruptcy", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySears, which more than a century ago pioneered the strategy of selling everything to everyone, filed for bankruptcy protection early on Monday and laid out a plan for turning its business around.The company long ago gave up its mantle as a retail innovator, falling far behind big-box rivals like Walmart and Home Depot and the e-commerce giant Amazon.Now, Sears is using a Chapter 11 filing in Federal Bankruptcy Court in New York to cut its debts and keep operating at least through the holidays.The company, which said it would close 142 unprofitable stores, faces long odds in trying to revive its fortunes. It will need creditors to agree that it should be reorganized rather than liquidated, as other bankrupt retailers have been.\u201cWill Sears be relegated to the dustbin of history, and will 68,000 Americans lose their jobs, or will Sears enter the next chapter of its life as an iconic American company,\u201d Robert A. Riecker, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, wrote in a court filing on Monday.Nonetheless, Mr. Lampert is prepared to sink more money into the company while it is in bankruptcy. Sears said it was negotiating with his hedge fund, ESL Investments, for a $300 million loan, that could help it continue to operate. Wall Street lenders have already agreed to lend the company $300 million.Mr. Lampert will step down as the company\u2019s chief executive, but will stay on as chairman. Three other Sears executives will share a newly created role, office of the chief executive, overseeing daily operations.\u201cESL invested time and money in Sears because we believe the company has a future,\u201d Mr. Lampert said in a statement on Monday.Sears listed $11.3 billion in liabilities and $7 billion in assets.The company\u2019s vendors have sharply limited the number of products they will provide on credit, making it more difficult for Sears to compete with other retailers during the crucial holiday shopping season.\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day for American retail,\u201d said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, a retail research and consulting firm. \u201cThere are generations of people who grew up on Sears and now it\u2019s not relevant. When you are in the retail business, it\u2019s all about newness. But Sears stopped innovating.\u201dFounded shortly after the Civil War, the original Sears, Roebuck & Company built a catalog business that sold Americans the latest dresses, toys, build-it-yourself houses and even tombstones. In their heyday, the company\u2019s stores, which began to spread across the country in the early 20th century, were showcases for must-have washing machines, snow tires and furniture.More recently, Sears became known for another distinction \u2014 Mr. Lampert\u2019s audacious feats of financial engineering. He has spun numerous assets off from the retailer into separate companies that his hedge fund invests in. As many of these spinoffs flourished, Sears slid toward insolvency.Over the past five years, the company lost about $5.8 billion; over the past decade, it shut more than 1,000 stores.Many of the 700 stores that remain have frequent clearance sales, empty shelves and handwritten signs.Sears stores remain the centerpiece of hundreds of shopping centers across the United States and their decline has reduced traffic to many of those malls.Reorganizing Sears will not be easy. The company\u2019s e-commerce business has only a tiny fraction of the sales of Amazon, one of the world\u2019s most valuable companies. And bringing customers back to Sears stores would require a level of investment that the company probably cannot afford.Although Sears lost its competitive edge long ago, its bankruptcy filing is still a significant moment for its industry. No other large retailer has endured as long or played as important a role in American life as Sears.Sears Roebuck was, in many ways, an early version of Amazon. It used the Postal Service to reach the most remote parts of a growing nation and sorted and shipped products from a three million-square-foot warehouse in Chicago.After World War II, Sears stores served the needs of the country\u2019s expanding middle class. Families came to have their childrens\u2019 portraits taken, to get their tires rotated and oil changed, and to buy Kenmore refrigerators.\u201cSears is where you went to shop,\u201d said Barbara E. Kahn, a retail expert and marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cThey sold fundamental products that consumers needed.\u201dThrough the 1960s and 1970s, Sears shared its success with employees at all levels of its corporate hierarchy. Cashiers, janitors and executives alike took part in profit-sharing and received options in the company\u2019s soaring stock.As many as 100,000 retired Sears employees still receive pensions, which are expected to emerge largely unscathed in the bankruptcy. As the company was bleeding cash and selling off assets in recent years, federal regulators required Mr. Lampert to inject cash into the pension plan. Other benefits for retirees like life insurance, however, could be in danger.\u201cIt is sad to see the company you really loved go down the tubes,\u201d said Ron Olbrysh, 77, who worked in Sears\u2019 legal department for 24 years and now heads an association of retired workers.By the 1990s, Sears was struggling to find its place. Walmart was plopping its super centers across the United States. Home Depot was taking away market share on appliances and power tools, but Sears had valuable brands like Kenmore, DieHard and Lands\u2019 End, and stores in prime locations.Things changed dramatically when Mr. Lampert arrived.A hedge fund manager who got his start at Goldman Sachs and had little experience running a large retail chain, Mr. Lampert took control of Kmart after it came out of bankruptcy in 2003 and then acquired Sears a year later. The company\u2019s board came to be dominated by other wealthy investors, including Steven Mnuchin, the current Treasury secretary who had been Mr. Lampert\u2019s roommate at Yale.Mr. Lampert says his strategy was to move the company away from its brick-and-mortar legacy into the digital era.His plan was to use the money saved from closing stores and selling off assets to reinvest in the business. But the company never gained traction online.The company\u2019s decline has also exacted a toll on its workers. Peggy Mitchell, 55, who works full time unloading delivery trucks at the Sears in Chicago Ridge, Ill., said she barely made enough to make ends meet.Ms. Mitchell, who has four children, earns $10.75 an hour and cannot afford the company\u2019s health plan. \u201cWalmart pays more than that,\u201d she said.Sears remains a publicly traded company, but Mr. Lampert exerts an enormous amount of control.He orchestrated a series of deals that generated cash for Sears in the near term, but sold off many of the company\u2019s most valuable assets \u2014 creating entities that he also has a stake in.Sears\u2019 shares, which topped $120 as recently as 2007, closed on Friday at 40.7 cents.Sears spun off Lands\u2019 End, the preppy clothing brand, into a separate company, which Mr. Lampert\u2019s hedge fund took a large stake in. The market value of Lands\u2019 End now dwarfs that of Sears.In 2015, Sears sold off stores worth $2.7 billion to a real estate company called Seritage. Mr. Lampert is a big investor in that company as well as its chairman. Seritage is converting many of the best locations into luxury offices, restaurants and apartments.Mr. Lampert is also seeking to buy the Kenmore brand from Sears for $400 million.Even in bankruptcy, Mr. Lampert will have great sway over the company\u2019s fate. His hedge fund owns about 40 percent of the company\u2019s debt, including about $1.1 billion in loans secured by Sears and Kmart properties. As a result, he could force Sears to sell the stores or transfer them to him to repay that debt.\u201cLampert will make out,\u201d said Mr. Olbrysh, the retired Sears worker. \u201cThere is no question about that.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "When Sears Flourished, So Did Workers. At Amazon, It\u2019s More Complicated.", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHalf a century ago, a typical Sears salesman could walk out of the store at retirement with a nest egg worth well over a million in today\u2019s dollars, feathered with company stock. A warehouse worker hired now at Amazon who stays until retirement would leave with a fraction of that.Much as Sears has declined in the intervening decades, so has the willingness of corporate America to share the rewards of success. Shareholders now come first and employees have been pushed to the back of the line.This shift is broader than a single company\u2019s culture, reflecting deep changes in how business is now conducted in America. Winner-take-some has evolved into winner-take-most or -all, and in many cases publicly traded companies are concentrating wealth, not spreading it. Profit-sharing and pensions are a rarity among the rank-and-file, while top executives take home an increasing share of the spoils.Amazon shareholders have benefited more than workers, but Sears, in its heyday, tried to serve both.Amazon, which changed how Americans shop much as Sears did in its prime, does not disclose what percentage of its stock is owned by employees.Not only does it reverse what had been an unusually broad employee stock ownership program, Amazon\u2019s decision underscores how lower-paid employees across corporate America have been locked out of profit-sharing and stock grants.\u201cWhat\u2019s happened is that shareholders\u2019 interests have squeezed out other stakeholders,\u201d said Arthur C. Martinez, who ran Sears during the 1990s and was credited with a turnaround. \u201cThe mantra is shareholders above all else.\u201dDecades ago, he said, \u201cthe people who produced or sold the product were more central than the people in the corporate suite. There was a different mind-set and it\u2019s linked to the larger issue of income inequality.\u201dNot only was Sears\u2019s program generous, it was also remarkably egalitarian. Contributions were based on years of service, not rank, and the longest-serving workers received nearly $3 for every dollar they contributed. The company phased out the profit-sharing plan beginning in the 1970s. This month, after years of lackluster attempts at revival, the retailer filed for bankruptcy protection.Companies like Procter & Gamble, S.C. Johnson, Hallmark Cards and U.S. Steel all embraced profit-sharing and were part of a corporate movement to encourage the practice, he said.Among some leading executives in the early to mid-20th century, Professor Blasi said, \u201cthere was a notion that wages were not enough and workers had a right to share in the fruits of their labor.\u201dIn the executive suite, however, profit-sharing still flourishes. While 68 percent of workers who earn more than $75,000 benefit from it, only 20 percent of workers earning less than $30,000 do, according to Professor Blasi. The decline of profit-sharing for the latter group has accelerated in recent years, with the median annual grant falling to $300 in 2014 from $921 in 2002.There are Amazon employees who hold a lot of stock. Four out of the top five executives earned less than $175,000 each in annual salary in the last three years, but got tens of millions of dollars in stock.By present-day standards, Amazon is relatively generous. In addition to 401(k)\u2019s, full-time employees receive medical insurance and a week of paid vacation their first year.Fifty years ago, Sears provided all of that plus a much larger annual retirement contribution. While the typical Amazon employee receives $680 from the company in a 401(k), the average Sears worker got the present-day equivalent of $2,744. Dividends on accumulated stock could add thousands annually.If Amazon\u2019s 575,000 total employees owned the same proportion of their employer\u2019s stock as the Sears workers did in the 1950s, they would each own shares worth $381,000.To make up for the lost stock grants, Amazon has provided raises of at least $1.25 an hour to employees who had been earning over $15, plus cash bonuses at five, 10, 15 and 20 years of employment. Employees can put 401(k) contributions into Amazon shares.Several employees interviewed, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, expressed disappointment. Amazon should have saved the dollar and kept giving workers stock, said one warehouse employee in Baltimore.Amazon insisted workers were not losing out. \u201cThe significant increase in hourly cash wages effective Nov. 1 more than compensates for the phaseout of incentive pay and future stock grants,\u201d said a company spokeswoman, Ashley Robinson.The calculus was different at Sears, said Dan Fapp, a former communications executive who worked there from 1963 to 1999. \u201cIf the company did well and the stock went up, your account was worth more,\u201d he said.At stores, there were also opportunities for salespeople to increase their base salary through commissions. So-called Big Ticket Men, who sold more expensive goods, earned the equivalent of nearly $50,000 a year.Stanley Hreneczko, 91, started working at the Sears in Troy, Mich., in 1965. He was a salesman in the appliances department \u2014 selling stoves and refrigerators. Thanks to his generous pay and the corporate savings plan, Mr. Hreneczko bought a home in cash and took summer vacations to Arizona and Florida.\u201cIt was like working in heaven,\u201d he said.Even junior employees were well taken care of.\u201cMost of these people retired with a good pension,\u201d said Jon White, who worked at Sears for 38 years, most recently as a manager in a store in Lithonia, Ga., before retiring in 2008. \u201cMost of them are comfortable for the most part \u2014 cashiers, clerks, replenishers, all kinds of workers.\u201dEven after Sears scaled back its profit-sharing plan, workers benefited from a pension plan that held a diverse portfolio of stocks and bonds and provided fixed payments based on their salaries and tenure at the company. With Sears in bankruptcy, the federal government is expected to guarantee some or most of those pension payments.Unlike Sears, Amazon is growing rapidly and the company says it is working harder to increase opportunities for promotion from the warehouse floor into leadership positions.But its warehouses are staffed primarily by legions of lower-paid hourly employees. Of more than 2,000 workers at its fulfillment center in Carteret, N.J., all but 230 earn less than $17 an hour, or about $35,000 a year. During a recent tour there, one worker, Julia Teran, said she had received six shares during her three years at the company.\u201cI keep it for my retirement,\u201d Ms. Teran, 58, said of her stock, which is worth more than $10,000. How does she feel about the end of stock grants? \u201cThings change,\u201d she said with a half-smile.Advertisement"}

Attrey and Dr. Roshan L. Attrey, also of Charlotte. The groom's parents are both retired professors. His mother was a professor of electrical engineering technology at Central Piedmont Community College in Charlotte. His father was a professor of English and dean of liberal arts at Livingstone College in Salisbury, N.C.The couple first made contact in December 2016 in Washington, where Ms. Monachan was working for the Department of Education, and Mr. Attrey, then living and working on the West Coast, was visiting the mother of a close friend who was hospitalized there.On a Friday, Mr. Attrey went on the dating website OkCupid and connected with Ms. Monachan. \u201cShe was a very beautiful Indian girl,\u201d he said.Ms. Monachan was also impressed. \u201cI thought, wow, he\u2019s really attractive,\u201d she said.She loved his line about travel. \u201cMany people travel to see the sights,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor me, the adventure lies in the people I meet, the stories they share, and the completely unexpected adventures that happen while I\u2019m there.\u201dThey arranged for a Sunday get-together over coffee at a bake shop in Arlington, Va., where Mr. Attrey found Ms. Monachan photographing the macaroons for Snapchat.In between sips of coffee, they learned that while they were both of Indian descent, his parents were from New Delhi and Himachal, in north India, and were Sikh and Hindu, while her family was from Kerala, in south India, and were Christian.They also discovered that they had both grown up in Charlotte, about 30 minutes apart, and had many mutual friends.They realized they were at the same Festival of India celebration in Charlotte in 2007. Mr. Attrey was on stage playing a tabla (an Indian percussion instrument), while Ms. Attrey was in the crowd cheering on the dancers, one of whom was a cousin.\u201cWe found out that we ran in many of the same social circles,\u201d Ms. Monachan said. \u201cEven though Keshav is a bit older than me, it\u2019s incredible that we never met.\u201dThey fell in love before their coffee got cold, and soon embarked on a long-distance relationship that got considerably shorter when Ms. Monachan moved to take a job in San Carlos, Calif., in September 2017.\u201cHe was smart, very friendly and very family-oriented,\u201d Ms. Monachan said. \u201cI never imagined I could find someone as extroverted as I am, someone who shares my sense of humor and loves people as much as I do.\u201dSix months later, they got engaged. \u201cKeshav has brought a ton of joy to my life,\u201d Ms. Monachan said. \u201cHe has helped minimize my flaws and maximize my strengths, and that\u2019s how I knew he was right for me.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Life is unfair this way.Mark Judge started out as the first kind of drinker and quickly became the second. He realized while still in college, at Catholic University in Washington, D.C., that he had a problem. He got into Alcoholics Anonymous, found help and wrote a book about his experience called \u201cWasted: Tales of a GenX Drunk\u201d (1997).It is not even close to being a good book. This may explain why it was published not by a mainstream house but by Hazelden Publishing, an arm of the well-known addiction treatment center. \u201cWasted\u201d received a short and dismissive notice (\u201cna\u00efve,\u201d \u201cearnest,\u201d \u201cthin\u201d) in The New York Times Book Review. It went out of print. It was mercifully forgotten.Twenty-one years later, \u201cWasted\u201d is perhaps the most in-demand out-of-print book in America. As I write, the only copy listed on Amazon can be had for $1,949.99. (The \u201c.99\u201d is oddly poignant.) Reader, I bought that copy. No, I didn\u2019t. I am not unhinged. But I managed to acquire a PDF of the book and have read it through.Who is telling the truth? Is Kavanaugh lying about not just this but other things, small and large? Not much hangs in the balance, except the future of the Supreme Court and very likely a decades-long change in the tenor of American life.Judge has reportedly testified to the F.B.I. about the night in question. That testimony will be more salient than anything that can be found in \u201cWasted.\u201d But what does this book have to say about the milieu in which the author and Kavanaugh were raised, and about prevailing ideas of masculinity in the 1980s?\u201cWasted\u201d is the story of a privileged young white man, a cocky princeling among cocky princelings, who loses his virginity, loses his religion, loses his lunch and nearly loses his mind. These things happen to a cassette-powered soundtrack by AC/DC, The Clash, Eurythmics, R.E.M. and The Replacements.These were, by and large, my bands, too. Born in 1965, I am almost an exact contemporary of Judge and Kavanaugh. I attended a private Catholic grade school in Naples, Fla., and a public high school there. The kind of drinking described in this memoir is deeply familiar to me \u2014 the parties in interchangeable houses when parents were away, the milling in backyards, the lines of parked cars trailing for blocks.My friends and I, like Judge and his, saw ourselves as part of a group we referred to as \u201cAlcoholics Unanimous.\u201d We responded to an emerging organization called Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) by proposing Drunks Against Mad Mothers (DAMM). We were, not to put too fine a point on it, idiots.By temperament \u2014 lucky for me, or maybe not, socially \u2014 I was not a jock or among the heavy drinkers. I hoped to be seen, to use a final, painful acronym that was popular at the time, one that is not in Judge\u2019s book, and please kill me now, as a SNAG, or sensitive new-age guy. I failed at that, too; another reason to pull out the church keys, as we sometimes called beer openers.Judge isn\u2019t a skilled enough writer to evoke the complicated longings that alcohol can instill. At moments of intensity, he tends to lean on analogies from his favorite J.R.R. Tolkien book. (\u201cI imagined myself as Frodo in \u2018The Lord of the Rings,\u2019 carrying the evil ring through the forest\u201d; \u201cI was like Gollum\u201d; \u201cI feel like the hobbits after they were captured by the Orcs.\u201d) A little of this, like J\u00e4germeister, goes a long way.Still, the facts say quite a lot. Judge spends a good deal of time describing \u201cBeach Week,\u201d a phase that, thanks to the emergence of Kavanaugh\u2019s youthful calendar, is on the way to becoming a euphemism as well-known as South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford\u2019s \u201chiking the Appalachian Trail.\u201dIn Judge\u2019s account, beach houses were rented by students after their sophomore year \u2014 the boys had the middle house, with girls in houses on either side, with almost no adult supervision \u2014 and chaos ensued. Judge puts it this way: \u201cWe lit each other\u2019s underwear on fire, had beer fights and barfed in the sink. A couple of guys took pictures of their penises, and when it became evident that one of the guys had a member that slanted, we called him Slope.\u201dHe describes a sense of camaraderie among the attendees, the girls as well as the boys \u2014 they\u2019d all grown up together, they were virtually siblings. He writes: \u201cIf you could breathe and walk at the same time, you could hook up with someone.\u201d He adds: \u201cThis did not mean going all the way for the most part, these girls held to the beliefs of their very conservative families.\u201dIt is widely assumed that Kavanaugh makes his one, now infamous, appearance on Page 59.\u201cDo you know Bart O\u2019Kavanaugh?\u201d\u201cYeah. He\u2019s around here somewhere.\u201d\u201cI heard he puked in someone\u2019s car the other night.\u201d\u201cYeah. He passed out on his way back from a party.\u201dDid Kavanaugh ever black out \u2014 that is, do things he was too drunk to remember? It\u2019s impossible to say. But Judge recounts several of his own blackouts. He awoke from one at the Four Seasons hotel in Georgetown. About another, he writes, \u201cI could have murdered somebody.\u201dThey drank because their parents drank. They drank because, as Sylvia Plath wrote in \u201cThe Bell Jar,\u201d \u201cthere is nothing like puking with somebody to make you into old friends.\u201d They drank until their eyes were Xs, like in the comic strips, as have young people throughout history, because they often felt self-pitying and tragic.That anyone cares about \u201cWasted\u201d in 2018 is a reminder that America has debouched onto a strange field. And it leaves you wondering about the people who needed help and never sought it.Advertisement"}

I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.The fight over Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh was supposed to be about a seat on the Supreme Court.But the past two weeks have transformed that discrete political battle into something far larger: A simmering war of the sexes that\u2019s deepening the divide between Democratic women and Republican men.The battle over Judge Kavanaugh is perhaps our starkest reflection of that new political reality.Let\u2019s think through these new dynamics with a little thought experiment:In a twist that will surprise no one, both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton addressed the confirmation battle in public appearances today, just an hour or so apart. (Yes, we\u2019re all caught in an episode of Black Mirror where we can never, ever escape the 2016 election. Just accept it. It\u2019s easier that way.)When asked by reporters if he had a message for men, Mr. Trump said:\u201cIt\u2019s a very scary time for young men in America, when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of. This is a very, very \u2014 this is a very difficult time. What\u2019s happening here has much more to do than even the appointment of a Supreme Court justice.\u201dMrs. Clinton had a different take, one that reflects the thinking of many in her party.\u201cI think what is happening is that on many many fronts, women, young women and girls, are saying, \u2018You have to hear our stories, too. We have the right to be heard,\u2019\u201d she said, speaking at an event hosted by The Atlantic magazine. \u201cI don\u2019t see it so much as some kind of conflict, as finally righting the balance.\u201dMeanwhile, the F.B.I. is investigating, trying to figure out what actually happened on that summer night so many decades ago. It\u2019s hard to imagine a conclusive ending. The reality is that both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey could be telling their truths. Maybe one is misremembering what happened. Maybe one is lying. It almost doesn\u2019t matter.The universality of their interaction \u2014 both for men and women \u2014 has tapped into something that\u2019s not likely to be resolved with a Senate vote.____________________We talked on Slack, which is the way a lot of conversations tend to happen at The New York Times.____________________Here\u2019s the latest in the ever-developing case:_____________________________________________________________Thanks for reading.

An early investigation by eBay found at least 50 Amazon representatives had sent hundreds of solicitation messages over the last several years. The Amazon contacts came from multiple countries, including the United States and Britain.EBay sent a cease-and-desist letter to Amazon on Monday outlining its claims. The Amazon representatives, eBay said, seemed to know that their use of its messaging system violated the company\u2019s terms of service.\u201cEbay does scan for key terms and they don\u2019t exactly like us poking around,\u201d one message read. \u201cHonestly the easiest way to communicate about this would be on the phone.\u201d Other messages involved weird phrasings that seemed intended to evade detection, such as avoiding using the word \u201cAmazon,\u201d and instead writing \u201ca-m-a-z-o-n Australia\u201d or \u201cA.M.Z.N.\u201dAn Amazon spokeswoman said the company was conducting a thorough investigation of the claims.Amazon\u2019s use of eBay member accounts and messaging for purposes other than buying and selling products was illegal under California law that prohibits the misuse of private computer systems, eBay said.\u201cWe have demanded that Amazon end its unlawful activity, and we will take the appropriate steps, as needed, to protect eBay,\u201d the company said in a statement.Since starting out as a pioneering online auction company, eBay has moved into more traditional e-commerce sales. Today, it says 89 percent of goods bought on eBay are at a fixed price \u2014 making it more of a direct competitor with Amazon and adding to concern that its rival was trying to poach top sellers.Amazon is adding to the breadth and depth of the products on its website by attracting third-party merchants. That lets Amazon tie up less of its resources in holding inventory waiting to be sold, but it also places extra pressure on the company to attract sellers that offer the merchandise that it believes customers want.Amazon charges for various services, such as selling, distribution and advertising. Last year, for the first time, more than half of the units sold on its website were from third-party sellers.While some sellers list on both Amazon and eBay, as well as other sites, others opt to pick a primary marketplace. EBay says it has more than a billion product listings at any given time.Advertisement"}

But a conscious convenience store?The Goods Mart was founded by Rachel Krupa, 38, a publicist who saw social opportunity in mundane shopping. \u201cMore than anything else right now, we want to know who our neighbors are, we want to talk to people, we want to have this connection,\u201d Ms. Krupa said. \u201cYou can have that sometimes by going to a bar, but you can also have it with your everyday staples.\u201d Ms. Krupa is a convenience-store nostalgist, having frequented one in the Sunoco gas station in her small hometown in northeastern Michigan. \u201cIt was that hub where you\u2019d run into high school friends or neighbors,\u201d she said. \u201cIf your mom said, \u2018Go get milk,\u2019 you\u2019d go to get out of the house and see who else is there \u2014 is the guy that you\u2019re crushing on getting gas?\u201d\u201cBodegas have some great products, but they also have all of the other things,\u201d she said, meaning conventional candy and soda. \u201cIt makes your process of selecting what you want much harder.\u201dEverything the Goods Mart sells is non-G.M.O. and free of artificial flavors, preservatives and dyes. Some are organic or locally made. Ms. Krupa is trying to cull the offerings so shoppers don\u2019t succumb to a paralysis of choice. \u201cInstead of having 50 kombuchas, we have six or seven,\u201d which, she admitted, \u201cis still a lot.\u201dThe first Goods Mart opened in April in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, down the street from A.P.C. and Aesop stores, next to a low-priced carwash. Besides highfalutin versions of household staples (bamboo toothbrushes for $6.95, organic packaged ramen for $2.75), the Los Angeles Mart has a bulletin board advertising volunteering opportunities and trivia nights. There is also a leafy green lounge, where, on a recent Saturday, people placed their laptops on repurposed buckets and tasted free samples of small-batch cottage cheese.The Los Angeles store accepts E.B.T. cards, issued by the state welfare department, and Ms. Krupa is waiting on government approval to do the same in New York. Produce past its prime, sourced from local farms, gets donated to homeless shelters, she said, where it can be used as ingredients in other food. Goods Mart shoppers are prompted to tip a percentage of their bill upon checkout, and every month the store donates the tips to a local nonprofit. (NYC Parks Stewardship will be its first New York beneficiary.)\u201cShe emailed us, introduced herself as the owner of this new business and told us about this practice they had instituted of donating tips,\u201d said Tina Christopulos, the co-chairwoman of fund-raising at Micheltorena Elementary School, a block away from the Silver Lake store. \u201cI was concerned, at first \u2014 would we be taking tips away from employees? She explained it further, and I was astonished, by the end of June, that they had raised over $1,000 for us.\u201d\u201cI have stopped in half a dozen times,\u201d Ms. Christopulos said. \u201cThey have delicious burritos,\u201d made by the restaurant Burritos La Palma, which was praised by the food critic Jonathan Gold. The other co-chairwoman of Micheltorena is a fan of the organic kombucha slushie \u2014 like a Slurpee, but without the high-fructose corn syrup.Last month, Ms. Krupa organized a happy hour for the school\u2019s students and gave out 100 organic Popsicles.

In September, Ms. Krupa leased an apartment on Mott Street, and she is continuing to work at her firm\u2019s New York office.She hopes eventually to arrive in the middle of the country, she said, \u201cwhere there\u2019s less access to the better options.

In moves that have important trade and geopolitical implications, Saudi Arabia and China have come to America to help solve their water problems and feed their people.The country, rich from its vast oil deposits, has one of the world\u2019s smallest water reserves. Saudi Arabia doesn\u2019t have a single lake or river. For thousands of years, the Saudis have depended on wells or the occasional oasis. Infrequent rainfalls replenish shallow aquifers 150 feet or so underground. Wells dug ten times as deep as those shallow aquifers tap into reserves not renewed by rainfall. Once used up, they\u2019re gone.But it wasn\u2019t enough. So they turned to the United States and other places rich in water.And water is becoming more precious in some regions of China. Water tables are dropping precipitously in northern China, up to 10 feet a year in some areas there. Drifting sands are covering hundreds of miles of potential cropland south of the Gobi Desert in northern China. The country\u2019s plans to divert water from rivers in southern China are running into regional politics, while rivers and streams in the north are still quite costly to clean up.

Later that year, a larger company, XPO Logistics, bought New Breed and the warehouse. The problems continued. Another woman miscarried there this summer. Then, in August, Ceeadria Walker did, too.The women had all asked for light duty. Three said they brought in doctors\u2019 notes recommending less taxing workloads and shorter shifts. They said supervisors disregarded the letters.The New York Times reviewed thousands of pages of court and other public records involving workers who said they had suffered miscarriages, gone into premature labor or, in one case, had a stillborn baby after their employers rejected their pleas for assistance \u2014 a break from flipping heavy mattresses, lugging large boxes and pushing loaded carts.They worked at a hospital, a post office, an airport, a grocery store, a prison, a fire department, a restaurant, a pharmaceutical company and several hotels.But refusing to accommodate pregnant women is often completely legal. Under federal law, companies don\u2019t necessarily have to adjust pregnant women\u2019s jobs, even when lighter work is available and their doctors send letters urging a reprieve.That means that companies that do not give anyone a break have no obligation to do so for pregnant women. Employees say that is how the warehouse\u2019s current owner, XPO Logistics, operates.If companies \u201ctreat their nonpregnant employees terribly, they have every right to treat their pregnant employees terribly as well,\u201d said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, who has pushed for stronger federal protections for expecting mothers.In every congressional session since 2012, a group of lawmakers has introduced a bill that would do for pregnant women what the Americans With Disabilities Act does for disabled people: require employers to accommodate those whose health depends on it. The legislation has never had a hearing.\u201cWe are deeply troubled by these allegations,\u201d said a Verizon spokesman, Rich Young. \u201cWe have no tolerance \u2014 zero tolerance \u2014 for this sort of alleged behavior.\u201d He said the company opened an internal investigation in response to The Times\u2019s inquiry. \u201cNone of these allegations are consistent with our values or the expectations and demands of contractors that work directly for us or have any affiliation with us.\u201dErin Kurtz, an XPO spokeswoman, said: \u201cWe\u2019re surprised by the allegations of conduct that either predate XPO\u2019s acquisition of the Memphis facility or weren\u2019t reported to management after we acquired it in 2014.\u201d She said the allegations \u201care unsubstantiated, filled with inaccuracies and do not reflect the way in which our Memphis facility operates.\u201d The company also disputed that the warehouse was windowless, noting that there were a number of interior windows.Ms. Kurtz said XPO prioritized the safety of its workers, had \u201cno tolerance for any type of discriminatory behavior\u201d and has enhanced pay and benefits for employees in recent years.Those improvements didn\u2019t help Ceeadria Walker when she got pregnant. The 19-year-old said she gave her XPO supervisor a doctor\u2019s letter from OB/GYN Centers of Memphis saying she should not lift more than 15 pounds. She said she asked to be assigned to an area with lighter items. Ms. Walker said her supervisor regularly sent her to a conveyor belt line where she had to lift more than she was supposed to. She miscarried the day after spending her shift handling those heavier boxes.A pregnant Ceeadria Walker continued lifting heavy boxes at XPO after being denied a reprieve. The day after a grueling shift in August, she miscarried.\u201cWe\u2019re saddened that Ms. Walker had a miscarriage over the summer,\u201d Ms. Kurtz said. \u201cWe\u2019re investigating these newly raised claims.\u201dFor most women, it is safe to work while pregnant.Two decades of medical research have established a link between physically demanding work and fetal death, though there is debate about how strong the connection is. Part of the difficulty in measuring the relationship, researchers say, is that it\u2019s impossible to design a study that isolates the impact of heavy lifting versus other risk factors, like pre-existing conditions.Another possibility, doctors said, is that extreme physical exertion diverts blood from a woman\u2019s womb to her muscles.The potential dangers are greatest for women whose pregnancies are already classified as high risk, which is why doctors often advise that they be given easier tasks.\u201cWhen employers ignore these medical recommendations, they are potentially jeopardizing patients\u2019 health,\u201d said Rebecca Jackson, the chief of obstetrics and gynecology at San Francisco General Hospital. \u201cIt\u2019s especially bothersome to me that this is occurring for women in strenuous jobs, given that they are at the most risk of injuring themselves or the pregnancy.\u201dWarehouses are among the fastest growing workplaces in the country, employing more than a million Americans. Retailers, competing against the likes of Amazon, demand high speed at low costs.On Memphis\u2019s east side, these are often the highest-paying jobs available for people without college degrees. Drawn by the proximity to rail lines and highways, some of the country\u2019s largest companies have set up distribution centers here. One dispatches Nike shoes. Another handles Disney toys. And a short drive from Graceland, Verizon has its hub.XPO runs all of those warehouses. The Verizon facility, which XPO took over when it bought New Breed Logistics in 2014, is the only one where The Times interviewed workers about pregnancy discrimination. Shifts there can last 12 hours. Workers get 30 minutes for lunch and as many as three other 15-minute breaks.XPO\u2019s 2017 employee handbook warns that taking unapproved breaks, arriving to work late or leaving early can result in \u201cimmediate termination,\u201d unless the reasons for the departures are \u201clegally protected.\u201d The Pregnancy Discrimination Act does not guarantee women such protections.It was the fall of 2013, and Erica Hayes was convinced that she was having a girl. She daydreamed about the clothes she would buy and made a list of favorite names. Her friend was pregnant with a boy, and they talked about raising their children together.At first, Ms. Hayes was processing individual shipments to Verizon customers \u2014 one phone, one charger, onto the next. Then, a crush of holiday orders hit the warehouse in December. She said that her boss began dispatching her to the area of the warehouse that handled bulk shipments, often destined for Verizon stores, where the warehouse was struggling to keep up. She often spent up to 12 hours a day lifting huge boxes, some with 20 iPads and 20 accessories.She said she could have handled paperwork or stayed in the section of the warehouse devoted to small shipments. But she said her supervisor kept ordering her to work with the largest boxes. Ms. Hayes\u2019s mother said that her daughter talked to her about the rejected requests at the time.Ms. Hayes said she began to bleed regularly at work. She sometimes left early to go to the hospital. Each time, she said, her supervisor wrote her up. As the demerits accumulated, she stopped leaving. Instead, she bled through four maxi pads a day.\u201cMy job was on the line,\u201d she said. At the end of a long shift in January 2014, she felt blood gushing into her jeans.A co-worker fetched her a black peacoat to wrap around her waist to cover the spreading stain. Another grabbed plastic bags to line the leather driver\u2019s seat of her 2003 Hyundai. Ms. Hayes fainted before she could get to the car. An ambulance took her to the hospital.A couple of weeks later, she said, her supervisor handed her a $300 invoice for the cost of the ambulance ride. (Ms. Hayes, who still works at the warehouse and is hoping for a promotion, said she never paid the bill.)That spring, two more women had miscarriages at the warehouse. Both said that their supervisors rejected their requests to pack lighter boxes.One of the women, who still works at the warehouse, declined to be identified for fear of losing her job.The other was Tasha Murrell. She already had two boys and was praying for a girl. She planned to name the baby Dallas, after the Cowboys, her favorite football team. Ms. Murrell said that she told her boss she was pregnant and asked to leave work early one day that spring because the lifting had become painful.While employed at the Verizon warehouse in 2014, Tasha Murrell, pregnant at the time, told a supervisor she was in pain and asked to leave early; the manager said no. Ms. Murrell miscarried the next day.Ms. Murrell\u2019s husband keeps the ultrasound from the pregnancy she lost in his wallet. It has become deeply creased from being in his wallet.Her supervisor told her to get an abortion, according to a discrimination complaint she filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in April 2018. Ms. Murrell woke up the next morning to find her mattress stained with blood. Her husband drove her to the emergency room, where doctors told her she had miscarried. Ms. Murrell left the job last year and is now an organizer with the Teamsters, which is trying to organize a union at the warehouse.Ms. Bukvic said that she made sure that the pregnant women whom she managed had workloads that were not excessive. She said she never denied help to the pregnant employees. \u201cIf they had any work restrictions, I always took all steps to make sure their work duties never exceeded those restrictions,\u201d she said.A few months later, in September 2014, it happened to another woman.Chasisty Bee, 33, was four months pregnant. Hoping for a girl, she bought a newborn\u2019s blanket from Burlington Coat Factory.Ms. Bee had miscarried in 2008 while working at the Verizon warehouse. This time, she said, she brought in a doctor\u2019s note recommending that she work shorter shifts, be given a chair and light duty. Supervisors rejected her requests. One afternoon, after almost 14 hours on her feet, she started feeling dizzy and crumpled to the warehouse floor. Her physician told her that she had miscarried.After Ms. Bee got pregnant again in 2015, she found a new job. \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to lose another child,\u201d she said. The next February, she gave birth to a healthy girl.Ms. Kurtz, the XPO spokeswoman, said: \u201cThe false and misleading allegations directed at our Memphis facility are fueled by the Teamsters and are part of their ongoing, but unsuccessful, attempts at organizing.\u201dA bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed upgrading the 1978 Pregnancy Discrimination Act. The bill would compel companies to accommodate pregnant women \u2014 for example, by offering extra breaks or the option of light duty \u2014 as long as it does not impose an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on their business. That is the same language used in the Americans With Disabilities Act.Women \u201cshouldn\u2019t have to choose between keeping a doctor appointment or their job,\u201d said Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, one of 125 co-sponsors of the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act in the House and Senate.But some Republicans, including Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, where the XPO warehouse is, viewed that bill as adding a confusing new layer of regulations, according to Senate aides. Mr. Alexander, who is chairman of the Senate committee on health and labor, co-sponsored a competing bill. It expanded protections for pregnant women in some cases. But it still allowed employers to deny accommodations if they weren\u2019t being provided to other workers in similar situations.\u201cIt was a useful mechanism in order to divert some of the momentum that was building,\u201d said Emily Martin of the National Women\u2019s Law Center, an advocacy group focused on women\u2019s rights.Both bills stalled.Outside Washington, there have been fewer roadblocks. At least 23 states have passed laws that are stronger than current federal protections (Tennessee is not among them). In Utah, Delaware, Colorado and New York, Republicans led the charge. In Nebraska, an anti-abortion Democrat pushed the measure.\u201cWomen have lost their children due to the lack of robust pregnancy protections in the workplace,\u201d said Catherine Glenn Foster, the president of Americans United for Life, an anti-abortion group. \u201cAnyone who can\u2019t get behind this or uses it as a political game \u2014 it\u2019s a travesty.\u201dXPO Logistics has had run-ins with regulators over labor issues. Last year, the state of California awarded four truck drivers $855,000 in back wages after XPO misclassified them as independent contractors.The problems extend beyond the warehouse floor \u2014 to hotels, restaurants, fire stations and stores.At the Albertsons grocery store in Atascadero, Calif., Reyna Garcia had one of the toughest jobs. She pushed 200-pound carts, dragged sacks of cat litter and climbed 10-foot ladders to stock goods.Ms. Garcia got pregnant in July 2012, found out she was having a girl and decided to name the baby Jade.Ms. Garcia told her boss that her pregnancy was high risk \u2014 she had previously given birth prematurely. She presented a doctor\u2019s note saying she should not lift more than 15 pounds. The boss ignored the recommendation, according to a lawsuit she filed against Albertsons in federal court in Los Angeles.\u201cShe was feeling like she wasn\u2019t getting any response from her supervisor,\u201d her doctor, Mareeni Stanislaus, said in an interview. She said the restrictions were \u201ceven more important\u201d because Ms. Garcia had a high-risk pregnancy. Heavy lifting can prompt smooth muscles like the uterus to contract, potentially inducing preterm labor, Dr. Stanislaus said.The regular twisting and hoisting caused intense pain, but Ms. Garcia needed the paycheck and the health insurance. She requested any other position \u2014 in the Albertsons bakery or at the meat counter or as a fruit cutter or in the pharmacy or at the customer service desk.Her boss turned her down, according to the lawsuit, which included corroborating statements from her colleagues.Her doctors sent two more notes. \u201cShe should avoid prolonged standing without a break and should avoid excessive bending and reaching and balancing,\u201d Dr. Stanislaus wrote. Copies of the letters were included in the suit.About three weeks later, in the middle of her shift, Ms. Garcia began feeling \u201cpelvic pressure,\u201d according to her lawsuit. She asked her boss for permission to leave early; he gave her a long list of tasks that she needed to finish first.Ms. Garcia ended up working overtime. By the time she got home, she could feel her amniotic sac bulging between her legs. It felt \u201clike a balloon coming out of me,\u201d she said in a sworn statement. She went to the emergency room. She could feel something scratching from inside; her doctor told her it was the baby\u2019s fingernails. She was 20 weeks pregnant.Five days later, Ms. Garcia gave birth to Jade. The baby lived less than 10 minutes.\u201cMy husband and I watched her die,\u201d Ms. Garcia said in her statement. \u201cIt was the most painful thing I have ever experienced.\u201dIn 2014, Albertsons settled Ms. Garcia\u2019s lawsuit for an undisclosed amount; the deal prohibited her from speaking publicly about what happened. \u201cThe company has a policy against pregnancy discrimination, and we accommodate employees with pregnancy-related disabilities in accordance with state and federal law,\u201d said Christine Wilcox, an Albertsons spokeswoman.Ms. Garcia\u2019s boss demoted her when she returned to work.\u201cI lost my baby for this job,\u201d Ms. Garcia said, according to her lawsuit. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you give me help when I was pregnant and asked for it?\u201dWorkers at the Memphis warehouse thought conditions might improve when XPO Logistics acquired New Breed in September 2014.At the time, XPO and its chief executive, Bradley S. Jacobs, were on a buying spree. His strategy was simple: slash expenses and deliver quick profits. Today XPO, based in Greenwich, Conn., has a market value of $12 billion.The company has had multiple run-ins with regulators. In one instance, the California Labor Commissioner\u2019s Office last year awarded four XPO truck drivers a total of $855,000 after finding that the company had misclassified them as independent contractors.In Memphis, XPO\u2019s ownership changed the warehouse, but not the way workers had hoped. Over the next couple of years, pressure on employees intensified and working conditions deteriorated, according to the 20 current and former employees. Supervisors began demanding that they pack 120 boxes an hour instead of 60. Some bosses penalized employees for spending too much time in the bathroom or on breaks.Plaques marking her years of service at the warehouse hang in Chasisty Bee\u2019s home. She left the company after getting pregnant in 2015. After two previous miscarriages while there, \u201cI couldn\u2019t bear to lose another child,\u201d she said.A spokeswoman for XPO Logistics, which processes orders for Verizon, said the allegations made by pregnant workers were \u201cunsubstantiated, filled with inaccuracies and do not reflect the way in which our Memphis facility operates.\u201dSummer temperatures inside the warehouse regularly exceeded 100 degrees, the current and former employees said. It was so hot and humid that workers sometimes found it hard to breathe.Every week from June through September 2017, at least one worker collapsed on the warehouse floor, the employees said. Supervisors took to wheeling the sick workers to the break room, where they sometimes received an ice pop.On the morning of Oct. 17, 2017, Linda Neal crashed to the warehouse floor, dead of cardiac arrest.Ms. Neal, 58, had suffered from heart problems. She previously had complained to her son, Dean Turner, that XPO supervisors would not let her leave early when she was feeling unwell, Mr. Turner said in an interview. That day, she had told managers that she was short of breath and asked for an extra break, but her supervisor rejected the request, according to Lakeisha Nelson, who witnessed the exchange and still works there. When Mr. Turner arrived at the warehouse, he said, three of his mother\u2019s colleagues told him the same thing.Ms. Kurtz, the XPO spokeswoman, said the company did allow workers to leave for the day after Ms. Neal died. She added that the Teamsters \u201ccontinue to shamefully exploit the passing of our colleague through the spreading of false information\u201d in their effort to organize at the warehouse.That same month, Ceeadria Walker joined XPO. The pay was decent, about $12 an hour, an upgrade from her last job at a car-parts warehouse. At first, she didn\u2019t mind the frequent 12-hour shifts. But she learned she was pregnant in June 2018 and started feeling nauseated and dizzy at the end of the long days.Ms. Walker said she gave her supervisor a doctor\u2019s note saying she should reduce the number of hours on her feet to avoid hurting herself or endangering her pregnancy. \u201cThey looked at it like it was nothing,\u201d she said.There were days when XPO let her work in the \u201cpit,\u201d dealing with the paperwork for orders, but she said she spent most of July on the conveyor-belt line hoisting 45-pound boxes.Ms. Walker toyed with leaving. But, she said, \u201cI couldn\u2019t just quit my job.\u201d She was near the end of her first trimester and needed money. She planned to name the baby, her first child, after her boyfriend \u2014 Octavia for a girl, Octavius for a boy.By the end of her shift on Aug. 4, Ms. Walker said she had handled hundreds of Verizon boxes. When she woke up bleeding at 6 a.m. the next day, her mother drove her to the doctor.Two days later, Ms. Walker spoke with The Times. She was distraught. \u201cThis was going to be my first.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.June 15, 2018Doris Burke contributed research.Advertisement"}

It seemed like a story worth taking up.\u201dSet in Jim Crow-era Florida in the 1960s, \u201cThe Nickel Boys\u201d follows two black teenagers at a segregated reform school called Nickel Academy, which promises to provide \u201cphysical, intellectual and moral training\u201d to young delinquents. One boy, Elwood Curtis, is a straight-A student who\u2019s on track to enroll in a local black college, but instead ends up at Nickel Academy after a miscarriage of justice. Confronted with the horrors of the school, where students are beaten and sexually abused, Elwood focuses on the message of Martin Luther King Jr., and tries to respond to hatred and injustice with love. His friend Turner, a street-savvy orphan, thinks Elwood\u2019s idealism is misguided and hopelessly na\u00efve. Their diverging views drive the plot, leading to a decision that has profound consequences.Mr. Whitehead said the subject felt more urgent to him after the 2016 election, so he set aside his Harlem novel.\u201cThe book about the Dozier school seemed relevant, just to make sense of where we are as a country,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve regressed and I think a lot of normal people and artists are trying to make sense of this moment.\u201dWith all the accolades heaped on \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d expectations for \u201cThe Nickel Boys\u201d will be stratospheric.Like \u201cThe Underground Railroad,\u201d \u201cThe Nickel Boys\u201d exhumes a painful chapter in American history, and examines how entrenched, institutionalized racism and inequality have inflicted lasting trauma on generations of African-Americans. But \u201cThe Nickel Boys\u201d is a more straightforward historical novel that lacks the surreal flourishes that made \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d feel like a slightly altered, off-kilter version of American history.\u201c\u2018The Underground Railroad\u2019 humanized the story of slavery, and this is really about Jim Crow and the costs of Jim Crow,\u201d said Bill Thomas, publisher and editor in chief of Doubleday.To research the school\u2019s dark past, Mr. Whitehead read news accounts and memoirs written by survivors. He gathered other details from a website for alumni of the school, where survivors\u2019 accounts are collected.\u201cThey provided a panorama of the different types of tragedies that happened there,\u201d he said. \u201cThose first person accounts provide the language and the smaller details that make the book live.\u201dMr. Whitehead said he hopes to highlight the experience of black students at the Dozier school, who, under segregation, \u201cgot it worse\u201d than the white boys, and whose stories have not generated as much attention, he said.\u201cFor decades, no one wanted to hear what was going on,\u201d he said. \u201cI think now people finally have agency, and people want to hear their stories.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Powell Says Strong Economic Path \u2018Not Too Good to Be True\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Tuesday that the American economy is enjoying an unusual but sustainable period of low unemployment and low inflation. He described the current moment, and the Fed\u2019s expectation that it will continue, as \u201cnot too good to be true.\u201dInflation is hovering around the 2 percent annual pace that the central bank regards as optimal while the unemployment rate has remained close to 4 percent for the last year. Economists have long regarded low unemployment as a harbinger of higher inflation, and there is no precedent in modern American history for both economic indicators to remain at such low levels.But Mr. Powell said there was reason to believe this time could be different.He said the Fed\u2019s success in holding down inflation in recent decades has reinforced public expectations that inflation would stay low, and that, in turn, is helping to keep inflation low.The Fed chairman\u2019s remarks are likely to resonate with Trump administration officials, who insist that faster economic growth is sustainable. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of higher wages,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s chief economic adviser, told reporters on Tuesday after Amazon\u2019s announcement. \u201cMore people working and prospering \u2014 you\u2019ve heard me say this before \u2014 is not inflationary. It\u2019s a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201dFed officials have long assumed inflation and unemployment sit on opposite ends of a seesaw: As unemployment falls, inflation tends to rise; as unemployment rises, inflation tends to fall.That model, known as the Phillips curve, accurately described the relationship between inflation and unemployment in the middle of the 20th century. But the volatility of inflation has diminished in recent decades. As unemployment has swelled and subsided, inflation has remained low and steady.Mr. Powell said Tuesday that the relationship has been weakened by the Fed\u2019s success in controlling inflation, which has instilled confidence that the Fed will continue to control inflation. As a result, even when unemployment falls, investors are not as quick to build higher inflation expectations into asset prices.\u201cMany factors, including better conduct of monetary policy over the past few decades, have greatly reduced but not eliminated the effects that tight labor markets have on inflation,\u201d Mr. Powell said.While the Fed sees little slack in the economy, Mr. Powell said he did not see wage growth as an indication that the economy was beginning to overheat since wages were rising in line with inflation and productivity. Even if wage growth began to outpace inflation and productivity, Mr. Powell said it still might not foretell faster inflation, pointing to the example of the 1990s.\u201cThe key is anchored expectations\u201d for stable inflation, Mr. Powell said.He added, however, that the Fed would remain watchful. \u201cCommon sense suggests we should beware when forecasts predict events seldom before observed in the economy,\u201d he said.Mr. Powell said that the Fed was raising rates because it might be wrong about the dangers of inflation, but that it was moving slowly because it did not want to impede or end economic growth.\u201cOur ongoing policy of gradual interest rate normalization reflects our efforts to balance the inevitable risks that come with extraordinary times, so as to extend the current expansion, while maintaining maximum employment and low and stable inflation,\u201d Mr. Powell said.Mr. Powell said the Fed also was paying attention to the economic performance of the rest of the world. The recovery in other developed nations has lagged behind that of the United States, but Mr. Powell said the overall picture remained \u201creasonably positive.\u201d\u201cI think growth is still healthy, but maybe under a little pressure,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018They Don\u2019t Have Money\u2019: Greece\u2019s Prostitutes Hit Hard by Financial Crisis", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATHENS \u2014 A prospective client walked into the narrow, dimly lit room in the basement of a broken-down building in central Athens. Elena, 22, took off her robe and stood up. Evaggelia, her 59-year-old, fiery-tempered madam, immediately went into her pitch.\u201cMy girl is flawless,\u201d Evaggelia said in Greek. \u201cI recommend her without reservation.\u201d She recited the \u201cmenu,\u201d and added that with one exception, \u201cmy girl does everything in bed.\u201dWithout taking off his sunglasses, the paunchy middle-aged client rubbed his chin and eyed Elena, a Russian-Polish prostitute, as she flipped her blond hair and turned in sky-high black heels. \u201cO.K.,\u201d he finally said.The price? Twenty euros, about $23.I was sitting a foot away on a small couch fitted with a plastic slipcover inside a brothel, witnessing this age-old transaction. We were on Filis Street \u2014 a warren of alleyways and dingy two-story houses \u2014 which has been home to Athenian brothels for most of the past century.The trade is more desperate now because of Greece\u2019s lost decade since the 2008 financial crisis, which has left no profession unscathed. The collapsed economy and the arrival of tens of thousands of migrants have pushed even more women into prostitution \u2014 even as prices have fallen through the floor.And for all the talk of a new era in gender relations, with women around the world speaking out and forcing a reckoning against sexual violence, #MeToo does not exist here in this room bathed in red and purple lights, where the women are silent and their bodies are for sale, and a coffee table is loaded with condoms.\u201cI had a flower shop for 18 years \u2014 and now I\u2019m here out of necessity, not out of joy,\u201d said Dimitra, a middle-aged woman who lost her shop in the crisis and now works as a madam on Filis Street. \u201cI used to be called Mrs. Dimitra, but now I\u2019ve become a whore.\u201dIn Greece, prostitution is legal in registered brothels, though the vast majority of brothels in Athens are unregistered. Street prostitution is illegal, yet women routinely sell sex on some street corners. While many women enter the profession out of economic necessity, others are trafficked or coerced into sex work.\u201cProstitution has increased and changed, basically in the context of the new political, economic and cultural environment,\u201d said Grigoris Lazos, a professor of criminology at Panteion University in Athens, referring to Greece\u2019s painful economic austerity.Mr. Lazos spent six years researching how the country\u2019s twin crises \u2014 migration and economic austerity \u2014 had changed prostitution in Athens. He found that the number of prostitutes in the city had increased by 7 percent since 2012, yet prices have dropped drastically, both for women working on the streets and in brothels.\u201cIn 2012, it would require an average of 39 euros\u201d for a client to hire a prostitute in a brothel, Mr. Lazos said, \u201cwhile in 2017 just \u20ac17 \u2014 a 56 percent decrease.\u201dAccording to Greek law, a brothel has to be at least about 655 feet away from schools, hospitals, churches, nurseries and public squares, among other places. But given the density of downtown Athens, it\u2019s virtually impossible to house prostitutes there legally. Mr. Lazos found that only eight of the 798 brothels operating in the city in August were legal.The number was vastly different from the police statistics, which count no more than 300 brothels in the city. A spokesman for the Athenian police, Theodoros Chronopoulos, explained that the official number does not include hidden brothels.Mr. Chronopoulos said that officers aggressively work to break up trafficking rings, pointing to rising arrests. But the police mostly leave brothels alone, he said, partly because of the sense among the authorities that they help single men deal with loneliness.\u201cWe\u2019re quite tolerant when it comes to brothels,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we understand that what they do is social service.\u201dThe police later provided an additional statement, with Mr. Chronopoulos saying: \u201cThere is no tolerance when it comes to brothels. The checks are intensive and constant and violations are applied where appropriate.\u201dNone of the women I interviewed spoke of their profession as a social service, and they often expressed disgust for their male clients. Evaggelia, the madam where Elena works, said of the men: \u201cThey\u2019re not worthy enough of a girlfriend. They think that by paying 20 euros, they buy something.\u201dAll the women insisted on using only one name because of the stigma and for safety reasons. None said that she had been forced \u2014 except by necessity \u2014 to be there. But none wanted to be here.\u201cI hate sex,\u201d Elena said. \u201cI like the money, not the job.\u201dAnastasia, known as \u201cAmazon\u201d to clients, has worked as a prostitute since she was 14. She\u2019s now 33, and says the work is harder than ever.\u201cPeople don\u2019t have money anymore,\u201d she said one afternoon in Satovriandou Street outside a hotel named Easy Access, where clients have sessions that last from 10 minutes to a half-hour.Anastasia says they promise, \u201cI\u2019ll come when I get paid,\u201d or they ask for bargains. Men often ask for unprotected sex, she said, and many prostitutes who are drug addicts take on such clients for less than 10 euros.\u201cThe ones that do it have AIDS, so they don\u2019t care, they\u2019re even doing it for vengeance,\u201d according to Anastasia, who is in rehabilitation for drug addiction. \u201cBut they\u2019ve destroyed the market.\u201dThe number of H.I.V. cases in Greece has actually dropped since 2012, when intravenous drug use was rampant during the height of the financial crisis, said Dimitra Paraskeva, the head of Greece\u2019s H.I.V. office. Greece had 628 H.I.V. cases last year, almost half the number from six years ago, according to official data.In the cheaper Athenian brothels of Metaxourgio, I met Monica, a 30-year-old Albanian prostitute who grew up in the northern city of Thessaloniki. She said she entered the business 10 years ago, when she lived in Crete. She moved to Athens five years ago, in search of a new life, and initially worked in a taverna.She had completed one year toward a culinary degree to become a cook and wanted to use her earnings to pay for a second year \u2014 but her boss never paid her a salary.\u201cI came here,\u201d she said of the brothel, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the only job that, once you do it, you know you\u2019ll get paid.\u201dToday, she spends six to eight hours a day trying to entice clients, but most do not stay.\u201cThey don\u2019t have money,\u201d she said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t had money for the past seven years.\u201dWhen she does get a client, she charges 10 euros for 10 minutes, and is allowed to keep half.\u201cA few years ago, they used to tip,\u201d Monica said. \u201cThey\u2019d give you 20 and 50, even 100 euros if they liked it. Now, no more tips.\u201dWith the Greek crisis, the clientele changed, too, the women noted. They are now largely migrants, many who live in the apartments above the brothels in the gritty, low-rent areas. Many Greek men are simply too poor to pay anymore.\u201cTheir wages used to be 800 or 900 euros,\u201d Monica said. \u201cNow they get nothing.\u201dBesides the increase in migrant clients, Mr. Lazos\u2019s research pointed to an uptick of about 5 percent in Greek clientele between 2012 and 2017.\u201cIt\u2019s something that a man can\u2019t quit,\u201d Manolis, a 33-year-old taxi-driver and brothel regular who insisted on being identified only by his first name, whispered one afternoon on Filis Street. A small white light was on outside several doors left half-opened, a signal to roaming clients that a prostitute was available.\u201cSex is like smoking,\u201d Manolis said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find 20 euros for it, one way or another.\u201dDespite the drop in prices, customers have become choosier.\u201cSeven or eight years ago, 20 to 30 men would go to the bedroom with the girl,\u201d said Vaso, 65, who has been a madam for the past 20 years. Today, she said, it is more like five or six.\u201cNow they come, take a look,\u201d she said, \u201cand say, \u2018I\u2019ll be back.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Facebook\u2019s New Gadget Is a Video-Chat Screen With a Camera That Follows You", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Since 2004, Facebook has said it wants to bring the world closer together. To accomplish that goal, the company has relied mostly on the web and smartphone apps.But software is no longer enough. On Monday, Facebook introduced a pair of video-calling devices \u2014 Portal and Portal Plus \u2014 to help expand its reach into people\u2019s living rooms.Portal, which has a 10-inch screen, will sell for $199, while the other model, with a 15-inch display that can be rotated, will be priced at $349. Facebook plans to offer the gadgets on a stand-alone website in time for the holidays, and has a major marketing campaign in the works.The devices are Facebook\u2019s first major foray into designing, building and selling consumer hardware from scratch. If the Portals are successful, the company could encourage more people to use its social network regularly to keep in touch with friends and family, as well as for apps like Spotify and Pandora.To address privacy concerns with Portal and Portal Plus, Facebook said the products include an electronic kill switch for the front-facing camera, as well as a cover for the lens. In addition, video calls are encrypted, and the camera\u2019s A.I. technology runs on the device itself, not on Facebook\u2019s servers, the company said.The company said the utility of the devices, which work on a household Wi-Fi connection, would convince people of their importance in a home. The devices are built atop Facebook\u2019s Messenger platform, and the communication software is hooked into a user\u2019s web of Facebook connections. Once Portal is connected to a Messenger account, people can video chat with anyone in their network across devices, be it on Portal, a tablet, a smartphone or a desktop computer.Instead of building its own virtual assistant three years after Alexa\u2019s debut, Facebook worked with Amazon. Like other Amazon-powered products, Portal can be controlled by speaking the word \u201cAlexa\u201d before a question or a request, like \u201cWhat\u2019s the weather in San Francisco?\u201d or \u201cSet a timer for 10 minutes.\u201dJonathan Collins, a research director for ABI Research, said it was wise for Facebook to collaborate with Amazon. While creating a digital assistant has helped Apple, Google and Amazon make their products look more attractive, there was no clear benefit for Facebook to make one of its own, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s not an obvious link to what they do for people at present,\u201d which is to deepen people\u2019s relationships, Mr. Collins said.Facebook had worked on hardware previously, though its involvement with Portal goes much deeper and further. In 2013, the company and the manufacturer HTC produced the HTC First, a smartphone that ran on a new Facebook-based operating system. The phone flopped.The company also sells virtual-reality goggles, which it got into when the start-up Oculus was already building those products. Facebook acquired Oculus in 2014.Rafa Camargo, Facebook\u2019s vice president who oversees Portal, said that when his team said it wanted to work on a smart home product with a large screen, his peers reacted in disbelief \u2014 especially since Amazon and Apple were focused on speakers and not video.\u201cEveryone was like: \u2018You\u2019re nuts. The whole thing is just about smart speakers and just voice,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Camargo, who joined Facebook about two years ago.But he said that voice was just one feature of the product and that Facebook could offer customers a different type of experience.\u201cWe come from focusing on people,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jeff Hawkins Is Finally Ready to Explain His Brain Research", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byREDWOOD CITY, Calif. \u2014 In the global race to build artificial intelligence, it was a missed opportunity.Jeff Hawkins, a Silicon Valley veteran who spent the last decade exploring the mysteries of the human brain, arranged a meeting with DeepMind, the world\u2019s leading A.I. lab.Scientists at DeepMind, which is owned by Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, want to build machines that can do anything the brain can do. Mr. Hawkins runs a little company with one goal: figure out how the brain works and then reverse engineer it.The meeting, set for April at DeepMind\u2019s offices in London, never happened. DeepMind employs hundreds of A.I. researchers along with a team of seasoned neuroscientists. But when Mr. Hawkins chatted with Demis Hassabis, one of the founders of DeepMind, before his visit, they agreed that almost no one at the London lab would understand his work.Mr. Hawkins says that before the world can build artificial intelligence, it must explain human intelligence so it can create machines that genuinely work like the brain. \u201cYou do not have to emulate the entire brain,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you do have to understand how the brain works and emulate the important parts.\u201dAt his company, called Numenta, that is what he hopes to do. Mr. Hawkins, 61, began his career as an engineer, created two classic mobile computer companies, Palm and Handspring, and taught himself neuroscience along the way.Now, after more than a decade of quiet work at Numenta, he thinks he and a handful of researchers working with him are well on their way to cracking the problem.On Monday, at a conference in the Netherlands, he is expected to unveil their latest research, which he says explains the inner workings of cortical columns, a basic building block of brain function.How a larger community of researchers react to Mr. Hawkins\u2019s work is hard to predict: Will they decide his research is worth exploring? Or will they write him off as too unorthodox in his methods and much too sure of himself?Mr. Hawkins has been following his own, all-encompassing idea for how the brain works. It is a step beyond the projects of most neuroscientists, like understanding the brain of a fruit fly or exploring the particulars of human sight.His theory starts with cortical columns. Cortical columns are a crucial part of the neocortex, the part of the brain that handles sight, hearing, language and reason. Neuroscientists don\u2019t agree on how the neocortex works.Mr. Hawkins says cortical columns handle every task in the same way, a sort of computer algorithm that is repeated over and over again. It is a logical approach to the brain for a man who spent decades building new kinds of computing devices.All he has to do is figure out the algorithm.A number of neuroscientists like the idea, and some are pursuing similar ideas. They also praise Mr. Hawkins for his willingness to think so broadly. Being a maverick is not easily done in academia and the world of traditional research. But it\u2019s a little easier when you can fund your own work, as Mr. Hawkins has.Still, some wonder if his self-funded operation, isolated from the rigors of academic interaction, is a quixotic adventure. They have been researching the brain one little piece at a time for a good reason: Piecing how it all works together is a monumental, hard-to-fathom task.\u201cIt is clear we need a better understanding of intelligence,\u201d said Tomaso Poggio, a neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who introduced Mr. Hawkins and Mr. Hassabis. \u201cBut Jeff is doing this the hard way.\u201d\u201cThe brain is by far the most complex piece of highly excitable matter in the known universe by any measure,\u201d said Christof Koch, the chief scientist and president of the Allen Institute for Brain Science. \u201cWe don\u2019t even understand the brain of a worm.\u201dIn 1979, with an article in Scientific American, Francis Crick, a Nobel Prize winner for his DNA research, called for an all-encompassing theory of the brain, something that could explain this \u201cprofoundly mysterious\u201d organ.Mr. Hawkins graduated from Cornell in 1979 with a degree in electrical engineering. Over the next several years, he worked at Intel, the computer chip giant, and Grid Systems, an early laptop company. But after reading that magazine article, he decided the brain would be his life\u2019s work.He proposed a neuroscience lab inside Intel. After the idea was rejected, he enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley. His doctoral thesis proposal was rejected, too. He was, suffice to say, an outlier.In 1992, Mr. Hawkins founded Palm Computing. A decade and a half before the iPhone, he had created a hand-held computer for the masses. When he hired the company\u2019s chief executive, Donna Dubinsky, he warned that whenever possible, he would drop his work with Palm and return to neuroscience. \u201cThat was always there, simmering in the background,\u201d Ms. Dubinsky said.Around the time of the second sale, Mr. Hawkins built his own neuroscience lab. But it was short-lived. He could not get a lab full of academics focused on his neocortical theory. So, along with Ms. Dubinsky and an A.I. researcher named Dileep George, he founded Numenta.The company spent years trying to build and sell software, but eventually, after Mr. George left, it settled into a single project. Funded mostly by Mr. Hawkins \u2014 he won\u2019t say how much he has spent on it \u2014 the company\u2019s sole purpose has been explaining the neocortex and then reverse engineering it.Inside Numenta, Mr. Hawkins sits in a small office. Five other neuroscientists, mostly self-taught, work in a single room outside his door.Mr. Hawkins said a moment of clarity came about two and a half years ago, while he was sitting in his office, staring at a coffee cup.He touched the cup and dragged his finger across the rim. Then he leapt to his feet and ran through the door.As Mr. Hawkins looked at that cup, he decided that cortical columns did not just capture sensations. They captured the location of those sensations. They captured the world in three dimensions rather than two. Everything was seen in relation to what was around it.If cortical columns handle sight and touch in this way, Mr. Hawkins thought, they handle hearing, language and even math in similar ways. He\u2019s been working on proving that ever since.\u201cWhen the brain builds a model of the world, everything has a location relative to everything else,\u201d Mr. Hawkins said. \u201cThat is how it understands everything.\u201dThe source of tension between Mr. Hawkins and other brain and A.I. researchers is not that they necessarily think he is wrong. It\u2019s that they simply don\u2019t know because what he has been trying to do has been so different. And so wildly ambitious.For the science to advance, what Mr. Hawkins has been working on can\u2019t stay in a silo. His ideas could benefit from extensive experimentation with other neuroscientists, said Nelson Spruston, a senior director at the Janelia Research Campus, a research lab in Virginia that focuses on neuroscience. \u201cA continuous cycle of testing and revising biologically inspired models of neural computation is the key to developing insightful theories of the brain,\u201d he said.Translation: Mr. Hawkins will have to open his work to rigorous scrutiny and find a way to interact with researchers who most likely have never looked at the brain the way he does.Advertisement"}

What About \u2018Deutschland 86\u2019?", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 When the spy series \u201cDeutschland 83\u201d had its premiere in 2015, it was portrayed as a breakthrough moment for German television. At that point, the country had yet to produce any prestige shows with an international following, unlike France and Denmark. The series, which followed a young East German soldier corralled into working as an undercover agent on the other side of the Iron Curtain, was the first German show to air on an American network, SundanceTV. In Britain it became the most-watched foreign-language drama ever.In making \u201cDeutschland 86\u201d \u2014 the second season of the show, which began airing on SundanceTV in the United States last week, and has been streaming on Amazon Prime in Germany, Austria and Switzerland since Oct. 19 \u2014 its creators had to confront the awkward reality of the first season\u2019s geographically divergent popularity. \u201cI would be honest and say it was quite painful,\u201d Ms. Winger said in a recent interview in Berlin alongside her husband. \u201cEvery interview I gave for two years began with, \u2018How does it feel to have made the most publicized flop in the history of German TV?\u2019 \u201dAlthough Ms. Winger says the first season\u2019s reception had little impact on their creative decision-making, \u201cDeutschland 86\u201d introduces an international setting and a more diverse cast. Its first episode finds East German foreign intelligence operative Lenora Rauch (Maria Schrader) working in South Africa with Rose Seithathi (Florence Kasumba) of the African National Congress. The spy been tasked with carrying out an illegal arms deal to help fill the coffers of the dwindling East German treasury. When the plan hits a snag, Lenora asks her nephew, Martin Rauch (Jonas Nay), for help, setting in motion a series of intrigues that take him across the continent.Ms. Winger said they had always planned to use a second season to explore the ways East Germany saw the world outside of its borders. \u201cYou don\u2019t often hear about how the East Germans felt their role was in global politics,\u201d Ms. Winger said. The Wingers also wanted to examine lesser-known elements of the Cold War, settling on the attempts by communist and Western powers to influence politics in Africa. \u201cThe Cold War is now romanticized as this simple, black-and-white world, but if you look a bit closer, you find it was much more complicated,\u201d Mr. Winger said.Germany\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for the first season, Mr. Winger said, was surprising partly because of the country\u2019s seemingly enormous appetite for television about its own tumultuous 20th-century history. But he pointed out that most German television takes an earnest, deferential approach to the subject matter, and some viewers might have been put off by the more freewheeling and humorous take on the Cold War in \u201cDeutschland 83.\u201d\u201cIn Germany, there is a certain look that is called \u2018authentic,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Winger said. \u201cI think there is a certain audience in Germany that doesn\u2019t want its historical drama to be stylized.\u201dHe said he also received numerous complaints about minor historical errors, like, for example, an inaccurately worn West German army uniform. \u201cEvery TV series builds its version of the past,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not going for historical detail, we were going for psychological realism.\u201dMr. Winger noted that RTL, a TV station known in Germany for its reality programming and police procedurals, was always an awkward fit for a prestige spy drama. He said the network was willing to broadcast a second season, but only if the Wingers tweaked it to be closer to its other, more popular series. \u201cYou should have seen the notes,\u201d Ms. Winger said. Ultimately, the show\u2019s production company, UFA Fiction, financed a second season with Amazon Prime as the German distributor, allowing the Wingers to maintain their original vision for the show.\u201cI don\u2019t think we made the show more for an international audience,\u201d Ms. Winger said. \u201cIt\u2019s such intense work, that when you\u2019re making it, you\u2019re making something that first and foremost you like.\u201dIn the years since \u201cDeutschland 83\u201d premiered, a number of other German series have been exported overseas. \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d an expensive coproduction between the German public broadcaster ARD and the private Sky channel, was sold in 60 countries. Last year, Netflix premiered its first German-language show, \u201cDark,\u201d and recently announced that it was producing five new German-language shows in addition to an already planned crime show, \u201cDogs of Berlin.\u201dMs. Winger recalled attending a recent TV showcase for Amazon Prime in London, where she was struck by the geographical diversity of the series being presented. Like Netflix, Amazon Prime has moved into producing more original foreign-language series, including \u201cBeat,\u201d a coming crime series set in Berlin.\u201cNow it\u2019s less that there\u2019s American shows and then a couple of things from other places, or that there are German shows and there are American shows, it\u2019s that there are good shows and bad shows,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always felt that way, but now I feel like everyone feels it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Billionaire Who Led Sears Into Bankruptcy Court", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFinancial engineers like Eddie Lampert are wreaking havoc on American companies.Mr. Cohan is a former investment banker and the author of four books about Wall Street.It\u2019s yet another cautionary tale about the limits of financial engineering. It didn\u2019t have to be this way. Mr. Lampert began this 15-year odyssey in 2003 after he bought the bonds of the failing discount retailer Kmart and converted those bonds into a controlling position in Kmart\u2019s equity. He ran his own hedge fund, ESL, investing money from wealthy billionaires such as David Geffen, the Ziff family and Michael Dell. Using their money, and some of his own, Mr. Lampert became a billionaire, too, with gargantuan successes investing in, among others, AutoZone, an auto parts retailer, and AutoNation, a car retailer. He saw opportunities where others did not, often won big, and became an investing legend.Mr. Lampert was wrong about that. He decided not to invest the capital needed to refurbish the Sears and Kmart stores to keep their inventory and appearance fresh. Instead, he made a huge gamble, one that never really paid off, to invest in Sears\u2019s website and online shopping. He was too early, and the Sears customer base never cottoned to shopping online. Instead, Amazon ate Sears\u2019s lunch (and breakfast and dinner) until he threw in the towel this year and joined forces with Amazon to allow it to sell Kenmore appliances, something that he long refused to do.Most others would have bailed years earlier. Not Mr. Lampert. It really was little more than an intellectual exercise. Could he figure out ways to save Sears and Kmart from bankruptcy, even though nearly everyone told him he could not? The answer, of course, was no. But that\u2019s not the end of the story. Since Mr. Lampert is Sears\u2019 largest single creditor, he is in a position to control the company again if and when it is able to emerge from bankruptcy protection. Mr. Lampert appears to be gearing up for that outcome. He\u2019s still the chairman of the Sears board of directors, although he gave up his role as chief executive as part of the bankruptcy filing. He\u2019s also proposed making a new secured $300 million loan to enable the company to continue operating in bankruptcy. And he\u2019d still like to buy the Kenmore brand, one of its most valuable properties, from Sears for $400 million. It will be up to a bankruptcy judge to decide.The question is, why would anyone give him that chance? Yes, many old-economy retailers have failed to adapt to consumers\u2019 changing needs. But the wizards of financial engineering \u2014 whether it\u2019s Mr. Lampert at Sears or the venerable buyout firm KKR at Toys \"R\" Us \u2014 have not done much better.

{"Headline": "New Pixel Phones and Other Gadgets Keep Google in the Hardware Hunt", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThough sales of its devices have been slow, the search giant unveiled the Pixel 3, a smart speaker with a built-in screen and a tablet that doubles as a PC. MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 For much of the last decade, Apple and Samsung have dominated sales of smartphones. So why would anyone bother trying to sell a new phone?The gadgets are Google\u2019s third wave since it started making consumer devices in 2016. The internet company has pushed these products as a way to showcase its prowess in areas like artificial intelligence and image processing.\u201cThere\u2019s some skepticism about how committed Google is,\u201d said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst for Creative Strategies, a consumer electronics research firm. \u201cThey are still nowhere near where they need to be to make a dent in the industry.\u201dGoogle has said that hardware businesses rarely become overnight successes and that it remains focused on the long term. The company said it put more stock in indicators like high customer satisfaction in its effort to build a loyal base. Google doesn\u2019t break out revenue or profit for its hardware business.While the handset market is no longer growing as much as it did five years ago, the company wants Pixel to be a blockbuster and to set the bar for devices running Android, Google\u2019s mobile operating system, said Mario Queiroz, Google\u2019s vice president of Pixel hardware.\u201cIt is our objective to sell as many Pixel phones as we can,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re investing accordingly to be able to do that.\u201dHere\u2019s a closer look at Google\u2019s newest devices.Similar to the latest iPhones and Samsung phones, the new Pixel 3 phones, which will become available on Oct. 18, have glass bodies to support wireless power charging. The technology relies on magnetic induction, which involves using an electrical current to generate a magnetic field to create voltage that powers the phone.Yet the screens are smaller than those of Pixel\u2019s competitors: The $799 model has a 5.5-inch screen, while the $899 model, the Pixel 3 XL, has a 6.3-inch screen. For comparison, Apple\u2019s new iPhone screens range from 5.8 to 6.5 inches diagonally, and the Samsung Galaxy screens measure 5.8 to 6.4 inches.The new Pixels also have a feature to make it easier to take good photos. The tool, Top Shot, captures a series of images when someone takes a photo; Google uses algorithms to recommend the best photo among the shots. Computers analyze millions of images to extrapolate the characteristics of a good photo, like smiles and clear faces. The analysis of the photos is done on the Pixel 3, not in Google\u2019s cloud; users will see a small chip icon marking the recommended photo. People can use the Home Hub\u2019s screen to watch videos and control smart home devices like security cameras. Notably, the Home Hub, unlike Amazon\u2019s smart screen products, lacks a camera for videoconferencing. Google said it had made that decision partly because of privacy concerns inside the home, especially bedrooms.The company\u2019s third new product, the Pixel Slate, is a convertible laptop, like a tablet with a removable keyboard similar to Microsoft\u2019s Surface. It runs Google\u2019s ChromeOS operating system and works with a digital stylus for drawing and writing. The device, which the company said would become available later this year, starts at $599.Mr. Queiroz said Google is just at the beginning of its hardware ambitions. \"Manufacturing and hardware are things that you build up over time, so we\u2019re very proud of where we are after three years compared to people who have been doing it for 10 years or longer,\" he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stocks Resume Slide, Pulling S.&P. 500 Briefly Into a Correction ", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe benchmark index fell to 10 percent off its most recent peak in early trading on Friday but recovered some of those losses. It is down more than 9 percent from its high in September.Disappointing earnings reports from the tech giants Amazon and Alphabet set off another turbulent day on Wall Street on Friday, and the benchmark stock-market index briefly dipped into a correction. Amazon ended down nearly 8 percent and Alphabet, the parent company of the search giant Google, fell 1.8 percent after they reported quarterly results on Thursday evening. Their reports did little to calm jittery investors who have focused on quarterly corporate updates in search of clues to the economic outlook for 2019. Amazon\u2019s sales forecast for the coming holiday season fell short of investor hopes. And Alphabet\u2019s revenue fell short of analyst expectations. \u201cThe poor earnings are reflecting a slowdown in growth, not a disastrous slowdown, but enough to take stocks down,\u201d said Ilya Feygin, managing director at the institutional brokerage firm WallachBeth. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the broad measure of the United States stock market, tumbled throughout the morning, falling as much as 2.8 percent before clawing back some losses to finish down 1.7 percent. At one point, the early-day losses had the index down more than 10 percent below its recent peak on Sept. 20. By the close of trading Friday, the S.&.P. was down more 9 percent from that late-September high, and is now in negative territory for the year.In financial markets, a drop of 10 percent or more is typically referred to as a correction \u2014 a term that describes a market sell-off that is more serious than a garden-variety slump. Such stumbles are not uncommon: Earlier this year markets fell more than 10 percent in a violent sell-off that ended in early February. There was some indication on Friday that the sharp downturn in stocks had some investors reconsidering whether the Federal Reserve will go through with an interest rate hike at its next meeting in December. Analysis of interest rate futures suggested that there was less certainty about that rate hike than there had been even a few days ago, according to Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets.Some pockets of the market sensitive to interest rates actually rallied, helping to cut losses. Shares of homebuilders, which have been hit hard this year rose more than 2 percent.Including this recent slide, six sell-offs have earned the correction designation since the current bull market for stocks began in March 2009. The nearly decade-long rise in stocks is one of the longest such runs on record. But given the length of the current bull market \u2014 in which stocks have risen nearly 300 percent \u2014 investors have been uneasy. \u201cThe question is: Is this the top of a bull market? And is the recession going to start?\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity strategist at institutional brokerage BTIG. But those worries are not necessarily justified, Mr. Emanuel said.\u201cFrom our point of view, everything that we see tells us that a recession is not imminent,\u201d he said.Fresh economic data supports that view. Government numbers released on Friday showed that gross domestic product rose at a robust 3.5 percent annual pace during the third quarter. Third-quarter corporate profits \u2014 which public companies are currently releasing \u2014 are on pace to be up more than 20 percent. Even so, there are factors that have dampened investor enthusiasm, including rising interest rates, slowing growth in China \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest economy \u2014 and cost increases tied to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.On Friday, the waves of selling, and the odd bit of buying, churned through the markets in a volatile session. Alphabet\u2019s share price was down as much as 5.5 percent and up as much as 1 percent before settling lower by 1.8 percent. Investors continued to pound the share prices of companies that offered less optimistic outlooks for the coming year. Mohawk Industries, which makes carpet, hardwood flooring and vinyl tiling, plunged 23.9 percent after its earnings report on Friday fell short of expectations. The computer-drive maker Western Digital, which delivered disappointing results in its report after the market closed on Thursday, dove by 18 percent. Not all corporate results have depressed the market. The information technology services firm Roper Technologies rose 7.6 percent on a solid earnings report on Friday, making it the best performing stock in the S.&P. 500. But on the whole, the technology sector continued its recent slump, as large and small companies alike continued to slide. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.1 percent, pulled lower by Facebook, which fell 3.7 percent, and Apple, which declined 1.6 percent. Both companies are scheduled to report earnings next week. The Nasdaq is down nearly 11 percent this month, in a brutal reversal for the tech and software shares that had been a favorite for mutual funds, hedge funds and other institutional investors this year.\u201cWe think that institutional money kind of got crowded into those kinds of names,\u201d said Kevin Dennean, Americas I.T. sector strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cFor whatever reason, you\u2019re seeing money come out of those high-growth software names.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Some Tips for Small Foundations Seeking to \u2018Punch Above Their Weight\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersFor years, the John and Wauna Harman Foundation was doing what most small family philanthropies do. It was writing dozens of little checks, deciding at the kitchen table what to give.But then the next generation got involved, and it began to ask what at first glance seems a contradictory question: Could the foundation have more impact if it wrote fewer checks?Julie Berrey, who married into the family and is now the foundation\u2019s executive director, said the answer \u2014 yes, it wanted to change how it made grants \u2014 led to the next question: How best to do that?\u201cWe were trying to build the airplane as we flew it,\u201d Ms. Berrey said.Confronted with the headline-grabbing largess of billionaire donors, Mr. Berman said, many small family foundations are trying to \u201cpunch above their weight\u201d and make sure their money is having a real impact. It\u2019s not always easy, but the foundations that succeed share common traits and have similar stories about feeling more gratified in their giving.\u201cWe often talk about taking thoughtful risk,\u201d Mr. Berman said. \u201cThere are lots of people fighting homelessness and lots of people trying to fight opioid addictions. Some are better than others, and you want to put your money to work with them.\u201dIn the case of the Harman Foundation, the family agreed to focus on end-of-life care but did not have any medical expertise on the subject and was limited to about $350,000 a year in grants. It decided several years ago to use its money to raise awareness through education.How the family decided on this was somewhat random: Many members had seen and been moved by a PBS documentary on the subject\u201cHaving something on PBS was fantastic because you get a bunch of eyeballs on it, but what do you do after that?\u201d Ms. Berrey said. \u201cWe said we\u2019d collaborate with the California Health Care Foundation and if it worked we\u2019d take it national. The response was phenomenal.\u201dSo the family made another grant, to the Hospice Foundation of America, with the hope of about 200 groups seeing the film. It has been shown about 1,500 times, with discussions afterward.Jeff Bradach, the managing partner and a co-founder of the Bridgespan Group, a philanthropic consultant, points to three strategies that foundations without enormous assets should consider. Having a concentrated focus is one option. Pooling money with other foundations is another, although ceding control can be complicated.\u201cThere\u2019s a question for all philanthropists: When are you comfortable being part of a puzzle, and when do you want to be the puzzle?\u201d Mr. Bradach said. \u201cOne can have a tremendous impact being part of a puzzle, but you can\u2019t always have a tremendous impact being the puzzle.\u201dThe foundation has moved away from funding homeless shelters and acting as a landlord of transitional housing to being more of a policy advocate in the state\u2019s capital, Hartford, and elsewhere, Ms. Elliott said.\u201cEarly on, people were advocating at the capital, but their work was not coordinated,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trust helped to fund the creation of a new organization, called the Partnership for Strong Communities, to bring together advocates and people who cared about homelessness. The goal was to help them understand what happened on the practice and policy level and to have one policy initiative.\u201dPooling resources has meant that Melville executives are sometimes the smallest group at the table. \u201cCollaboration is never easy,\u201d Ms. Elliott said. \u201cBut if we don\u2019t do it, we\u2019re only at our $7 million and that\u2019s all we can do.\u201dShe said her foundation had worked with the Gates, Ford, Annie E. Casey and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations. Because of its size, if the big foundations asked Melville to join a partnership, \u201cwe\u2019d be left out,\u201d Ms. Elliott said. Instead, she said, Melville made the first move. \u201cSo we go ahead and start it ourselves,\u201d she said, \u201cand then ask the others to join.\u201dAs a third strategy, small foundations can opt to take a risk on early-stage nonprofit groups and ideas. Although bigger donors, like Bloomberg Philanthropies, can afford to regularly test out ideas, such investments could wipe out a small foundation.Mr. Berman said small foundations needed to get comfortable with this risk. \u201cOur funders are doing it on the small level,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019ll make a big impact in a small pond, and there are a lot of small ponds out there.\u201dSeveral years ago, the foundation, whose patriarch made his fortune in the asphalt business, gave $20,000 to Minnesota\u2019s Department of Human Services to pull together some information and hire a grant writer, Ms. O\u2019Keefe said. The department ended up being awarded a $3 million grant over four years.\u201cWhen I got that call, I thought that was a good investment,\u201d she said.Mr. Berman said he advised all small foundations to look for strong nonprofit leaders to invest in. This requires donors to talk to the beneficiaries of those nonprofit groups.Even when small foundations decide to stick to what they\u2019ve been doing \u2014 say, giving a local scholarship or funding symphonies and museums \u2014 Mr. Berman challenges them.\u201cI say that\u2019s fine,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019ll push them to make sure they\u2019re doing that in the most thoughtful way, to have the impact they want.\u201dStill, the outcome is not guaranteed. While the Harman Foundation is thrilled by how many people have seen the film, data showed gaps in who went to the screenings, Ms. Berrey said.\u201cDespite everyone\u2019s best efforts to bring in minorities, it wasn\u2019t culturally successful,\u201d she said. \u201cSince then, we\u2019ve honed our strategy and are doing work in the African-American community.\u201dAnd a small foundation\u2019s learning from the data is a lesson right out of big philanthropy\u2019s playbook.Advertisement"}

But a surprising pairing can be part of the magic, editors said: somebody who knows the subject matter or the themes well, but who is not \u201ctoo matchy-matchy,\u201d as Mr. Beckerman put it. In those cases, the writers might be competitors in their topic area, or the review might read as boring or insular.\u201cThe review itself should be something that informs and enlightens,\u201d said Pamela Paul, editor of the Book Review. \u201cAbove all, we\u2019re looking for someone who can write an informative, authoritative, honest and engaging review\u201d \u2014 whether it\u2019s negative, positive or somewhere in between.Gregory Cowles, a senior editor for the Book Review, said that when he was an assigning editor, he \u201cwould sometimes just walk into a bookstore and kind of let my eyes rove over the shelves to see if anything jumped out at me that I hadn\u2019t thought of for a while.\u201d Pairing is not an easy aspect of the job, but for those who bring together the Book Review each week, it can be among the most rewarding. \u201cIt\u2019s been a magical job in terms of working with some of the people that I grew up reading,\u201d Mr. Cowles said. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with Stephen King, who, for a time during middle school, was the one person that I read.

{"Headline": "For Japan, N.B.A. 101 Is Now in Session", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Pete Pranica, the longtime television voice of the Memphis Grizzlies, appeared to be square dancing as he stood in a small conference room here, demonstrating for Japanese broadcasters the N.B.A. violation of thrusting out a hip while setting a screen.Viewers, he told his fellow commentators through an interpreter, expect \u201cthat you know all there is to know about the N.B.A.\u201dFor two days in late September, using a dry-erase board, video and a Power Point presentation, Pranica patiently and deftly explained everything from rules changes to team-by-team outlooks to preparing to broadcast a game. His attire \u2014 a Grizzlies polo shirt and khakis \u2014 was casual, but his message was not.The N.B.A. has had a presence in Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, for three decades and has played 12 regular-season games here since 1990. Yet, some of the broadcasters attending Pranica\u2019s workshop had little experience calling league games, having spent much of their careers covering baseball and soccer or high school basketball.Was it true, Pranica was asked, that the collective jersey numbers of the three referees at each N.B.A. game must not exceed 100?\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d he said diplomatically.Hence, the urgency of Pranica\u2019s seminar.In Japan, the N.B.A. is not viewed with the same fervor or depth of knowledge as in other Asian countries like the Philippines, where basketball is the No. 1 participation sport. In China, the top N.B.A. market outside the United States, an estimated 300 million people play the sport and 640 million cumulative viewers watched league programming last season.\u201cThe Philippines is a beacon for us when we think about the kind of popularity we\u2019d love to see in markets like Japan,\u201d Matt Brabants, the N.B.A.\u2019s senior vice president for global media distribution and business operations, said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd we have to work at that.\u201dSeparately, Rakuten became a jersey sponsor of the Golden State Warriors for a reported $60 million over three seasons. The company name appears on the team\u2019s jerseys and practice facility.Rakuten represents the N.B.A.\u2019s most inclusive media partnership ever in Japan. But while a number of Japanese baseball and soccer players have enjoyed prominent international careers, only one Japanese-born player has ever played in the N.B.A.In recent years, the management of professional basketball in Japan has been in turmoil. The Japan Basketball Association was suspended in 2014 by FIBA for operating two competing professional leagues.The matter was resolved, and the Japanese basketball federation was reinstated in 2015. The two pro leagues merged into what is now a three-tiered league called the B.League, which began play during the 2016-17 season and features relegation and promotion like a professional soccer league.Yet, the rules and tactics of basketball are not as widely understood in Japan as in the Philippines and China, said J.R. Henderson, a Californian who played on U.C.L.A.\u2019s 1995 N.C.A.A. championship team and has played professionally in Japan since 2001.\u201cIt\u2019s not about the N.B.A.; it\u2019s about basketball,\u201d Henderson said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the rules or substitution patterns, why timeouts are called at certain times in a game, how come sometimes the game is fast and why sometimes you slow it down.\u201dHenderson, now 41, played 30 games for the then Vancouver Grizzlies during the 1998-99 N.B.A. season and has become a naturalized Japanese citizen known here as J.R. Sakuragi.He plays for the Aisin Seahorses of the Japan league\u2019s top division. His teammates have an intimate knowledge of the N.B.A. and try to mimic its stars, Henderson said. Within his team, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s no different than fans in the States.\u201dOutside of his basketball circle, though, Henderson said, \u201cYou would have a hard time finding someone who knows who Carmelo Anthony is.\u201dBut opportunities are growing for Japan to become more familiar with the N.B.A.\u2019s players. The Rakuten deal is giving the league broader exposure. A basketball magazine called Dabudori (Double Dribble) has been available for the last year. And dozens of N.B.A. stars are expected to participate in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.Yuta Watanabe, a rookie 6-foot-9 forward from Japan who played at George Washington, has signed a two-way contract with the Memphis Grizzlies for the 2018-19 season, permitting him limited transfers from the team\u2019s G League, or developmental teams.Rui Hachimura, a 6-8 forward who could be Japan\u2019s top basketball prospect ever, is entering his junior season at Gonzaga. He is a mainstay on Japan\u2019s national team and, according to Gonzaga, only the fifth Japanese-born men\u2019s player to participate in Division I basketball.A Japanese player who could succeed in the N.B.A. \u201cfor more than a couple of games, say two or three years, would make a huge difference,\u201d Henderson said.Another difference could come from the way fans watch games. In the recent Summer League, the N.B.A. experimented with a broadcast format called vertical view. It was spurred, in part, Pranica said, by the preference of Chinese fans to watch their cellphones in the upright or portrait position, instead of the sideways or landscape position, during crowded morning rail commutes, when live games are typically broadcast there from the United States. Presumably, Japanese fans would have similar interest in the vertical view format.The N.B.A. is now available in 215 countries in 50 languages. In the Philippines, N.B.A. officials said, the most sophisticated fans prefer English-language broadcasts by former coaches and players like Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson.\u201cThey have good input, and they\u2019re funny,\u201d Riel Cruz, a restaurateur from the Philippines, said while returning home on a flight through Tokyo after vacationing in the United States. \u201cThe Filipino guys, some of what they say is nonsense. They talk about what they had for breakfast.\u201dFans in Japan mostly prefer games described in their native tongue, with additional context beyond the shorthand of an American broadcast, N.B.A. officials said.

How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Sheera Frenkel, a technology reporter in San Francisco, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.Q. You cover cybersecurity and are extra careful about the security of your devices, apps and communications. What does your setup look like?If an email would be super embarrassing to me if it leaked, maybe I would be better off not writing it? If a photo or video of my family would leave my loved ones feeling exposed if it was made public, maybe I shouldn\u2019t keep it on my work laptop? I know that\u2019s not an easy way for everyone to live, but I\u2019ve covered enough breaches to know that nobody expects to be hacked, and when they are, the first thing they say is that they wish they hadn\u2019t left themselves so vulnerable.My setup is to basically have two systems: a work laptop, on which I try to keep everything professional so that if and when it is hacked the damage will be minimal, and then a second laptop, which I use for anything personal and never connect to my work system.On both laptops, I use a password manager and multifactor authentication, which means that I have to verify who I am before I can get access to anything from Twitter to Gmail.I think those precautions are the bare minimum of what we should all be doing. And even with all that, I just assume I\u2019m going to be hacked any day.What could be better about it?My phone is probably the one place where I can\u2019t keep to my own standards of separating work from personal life. I tried to have two phones for a while but found it impossible to keep them straight.I also can\u2019t help but keep a few photos of my daughter on my work laptop. And she\u2019s currently my desktop photo. She\u2019s just too darn cute not to stare at every day.Most tech companies do a terrible job of educating people about their security, because they tend to just flood the zone with information and make it seem that if you aren\u2019t doing everything, you are a failure. Most people I talk to say they are intimidated by what they think they need to do to stay safe online \u2014 and end up doing nothing at all.What tech product are you and your family currently obsessed with at home?We aren\u2019t a big tech family! We try really hard to keep tech out of sight of our 1-year-old daughter. Kids are funny, though \u2014 even though we don\u2019t watch TV around her, she loves to carry the remote around the house. My iPhone is her favorite teething toy, and she has learned how to get my laptop out of my backpack and slide it across the floor until she can hide it under the sofa.So I would say the one piece of tech that has been really useful is the tracking function \u2014 Find My iPhone or Find My Mac \u2014 on both devices. I\u2019ve had to put the Tile location devices, which are wireless trackers that help us keep tabs on items, on everything else.When I was pregnant, I used every app I could get my hands on to keep track of what was happening. I knew I was giving away a lot of data, but I loved how apps like Glow compared my growing baby to a piece of fruit every few week so I could visualize how she went from being the size of a blueberry to, well, a really large squash.When she was born, I thought those same apps were going to give me a sense of community where I could ask questions and get advice. Instead, I discovered a bottomless pit of mommy-shaming and weird niche parenting cliques that seemed aimed at making women feel that whatever they were doing wasn\u2019t enough.So I went old school and spoke to women I knew who seemed to be handling motherhood and their careers in a way I admired. When it came time to find a nanny, I spoke to people I trusted and interviewed nannies in person until I met someone who made my daughter smile and seemed to fit into our family dynamic. There are plenty of apps for nannies and babysitters, but it wasn\u2019t the sort of thing I wanted a crowd-aggregated score for.I\u2019m sure the day will come when we have wonderful fuzzy robots that nurse babies for us and act as perfect nannies. But for now, I\u2019ve found that good friends and family who are willing to drop everything to come over and help are really the most important thing.Oh, and an Amazon Prime membership.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Slumping Stock Market Enters Negative Territory for the Year ", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother wave of selling hit the nearly decade-long bull market as investors worried that the ideal climate they have long enjoyed \u2014 a surging economy, low interest rates and fast-growing corporate profits \u2014 would soon be behind them. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index shed 3 percent on Wednesday, wiping out its gains for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 4.4 percent, and has fallen more than 12 percent since early September.Just over a month ago, the S.&P. 500 was up nearly 10 percent for 2018, with expectations that coming quarterly corporate earnings reports \u2014 juiced by a generous tax cut and strong economic growth \u2014 would keep sending stock prices upward. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.\u201cIt was kind of a market that was looking for a reason to have some money come out of it,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. \u201cAnd it found it.\u201dThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 608 points, or 2.4 percent, on Wednesday. And the Nasdaq has now fallen into correction territory \u2014 a decline of more than 10 percent from an earlier peak, which indicates a drop that\u2019s more serious than a garden-variety slump. The S.&P. 500 is down to 2,656.10, more than 9 percent off its recent peak on Sept. 20, meaning it, too, is nearing a correction. Some market observers think that investors may be moving to the sidelines before what could be a very close and bitter election. \u201cI think people just want to clear the decks and get the heck out before the midterm elections, frankly,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. President Trump has repeatedly cited the strong performance of the stock market as evidence of the success of his administration\u2019s business-friendly approach. And as the market has slid lately, he has ratcheted up his criticism of the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to raise interest rates as economic growth remains strong. Low interest rates have helped support economic growth and the stock market since the financial crisis 10 years ago. But with unemployment at a 49-year low, the Fed is now raising interest rates, saying it wants to keep the economy from overheating, which could set off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again at its next meeting in December.The rise in interest rates has been particularly painful for some pockets of the markets. Shares of homebuilders are down more than 16 percent this month, as rising mortgage rates have made houses less affordable. Smaller companies \u2014 which are heavily exposed to floating-rate debt \u2014 have also been hurt by rising rates, which increases the cost of their debt payments. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks has fallen more than 13 percent in October. And the president\u2019s trade war with China has increasingly preoccupied the markets, analysts said. Official numbers released by Beijing last week showed China\u2019s economic growth has slowed to 6.5 percent, its lowest level since 2009. The slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, could mean falling sales for American companies that export to that market. As large consumers of metal who have invested heavily to gain access to the Chinese auto market \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 carmakers are particularly vulnerable to such risks. On Wednesday, Ford cited weak sales in China for falling profits. Company officials said issues surrounding trade disputes \u2014 including tariffs on imported steel and aluminum \u2014 could cost Ford $1 billion this year. \u201cWhat is really happening here is that people are saying, \u2018We just don\u2019t know about trade. We don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to hit the margins or the earnings streams next year,\u2019\u201d said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm Weeden & Company. Mr. Purves said investors were eager for a resolution to the trade dispute and nervous that it could escalate further.\u201cI think there is a game of chicken going on between Trump and the markets right now,\u201d he added. On Wednesday, the market tumble snowballed over the course of the day. Technology companies that have driven big market gains were badly battered. Shares in the tech heavyweights Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all fell more than 5 percent. Netflix fell more than 9 percent after a media report that Apple planned to announce a subscription television service that would go head-to-head with its streaming service. The news wasn\u2019t all bad for tech. Later Wednesday, Microsoft reported results that exceeded analyst expectations, sending its shares higher in after-hours trading. And Tesla shares also rose in after-hours trading after the electric-car maker reported its first profit in two years. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Pitofsky, Champion of Consumer Protection, Dies at 88", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobert Pitofsky, who as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in the Clinton administration advocated stricter enforcement of competition and greater protection for consumers, died on Oct. 6 at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 88.The cause was complications of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, his son David said.Mr. Pitofsky was a leading figure in competition law. An antitrust scholar and a former dean of the Georgetown University law school, he wove in and out of government, private law practice and academia over his career.President Bill Clinton appointed Mr. Pitofsky to head the Federal Trade Commission in 1995. At the time, it was a sleepy agency colloquially referred to as \u201cthe little old lady of Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201dMr. Pitofsky soon sought to call attention to the growing threat of corporate consolidation, particularly with the rise of technology. During his tenure the agency would become the central watchdog for the internet and technology industries.Mr. Pitofsky won support from consumer groups that had pushed for greater scrutiny of mergers and stronger consumer protection in matters like deceptive advertising. But he was also criticized by some free-market conservatives and antitrust lawyers, who said he was trying to expand antitrust enforcement too far.Early on Mr. Pitofsky held public hearings to gather input on how the F.T.C. might look beyond traditional views of antitrust enforcement to better account for the modernization of the economy and the growth of technology.Mr. Pitofsky\u2019s push to update antitrust policy has echoes today, as the F.T.C. is again opening debate on how it approaches competition enforcement in the tech sector. Consumer groups and some lawmakers have raised concerns that a handful of companies, like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple, have outsize influence on the economy even though they apparently do not violate antitrust laws.Last month, at the first of a series of F.T.C. hearings on antitrust at the Georgetown Law Center, Joe Simons, the current chairman, said he was modeling the hearings after those held by Mr. Pitofsky in 1995.Mr. Simons, who was a student of Mr. Pitofsky\u2019s at Georgetown, said in a statement this week that Mr. Pitofsky was \u201cone of the true giants of his field\u201d and that he had been \u201cinstrumental in establishing a strong bipartisan consensus on how to do antitrust enforcement and policy.\u201dAs F.T.C. chairman, Mr. Pitofsky sought to block nearly a dozen mergers, including that of the office-supply retailers Staples and Office Depot. The companies tried to merge again in 2015 but were again blocked.The agency under Mr. Pitofsky also filed to block the merger of BP Amoco with Atlantic Richfield, until BP agreed to sell off $7 billion worth of Arco\u2019s Alaska oil assets to Phillips Petroleum. In 2000, however, the agency ultimately agreed to approve Time Warner\u2019s $165 billion merger with AOL, with certain conditions.He pledged to make antitrust apolitical and to balance free-market interests with concerns that consolidation among corporations was threatening consumer welfare.Robert Pitofsky was born in Paterson, N.J., on Dec. 27, 1929, to Morris and Sadye Pitofsky. His father fixed textile looms, and his mother sold dresses.He graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English literature from New York University in 1951 and earned a law degree at Columbia Law School in 1954. He served in the Army for two years before joining the private law firm Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood in New York, where his first case was defending Eli Lilly against antitrust charges. In 1964 he began teaching law courses at New York University.Mr. Pitofsky joined Georgetown University\u2019s law school in 1973 as a professor and stayed until 1978, when he was appointed an F.T.C. commissioner. He returned to Georgetown Law in 1981 and became dean in 1983. He held that position until 1989.In addition to his son David, Mr. Pitofsky is survived by his wife, Sally Levy Pitofsky; another son, Alex; a daughter, Liz Pitofsky; and seven grandchildren.Mr. Pitofsky returned to teaching several times over the years. In addition to Mr. Simons, President Trump\u2019s nominee to the F.T.C., his students included Christine Varney, who was in charge of antitrust at the Justice Department during the Obama administration.In an interview with Washington Lawyer in 2002, Mr. Pitofsky said, \u201cI think a really good class is one of the great pleasures in life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If the future of the internet is a tripartite cold war, Silicon Valley wants to be making money in all three of those worlds.Part of the rationalization is that whether or not American companies get in on the action, a homegrown company will readily enact the kind of censorship and surveillance that its government requires. (Indeed, if Google launches in China, it has an uphill battle to fight against Baidu, the entrenched, government-endorsed Chinese search engine.) What this future will bring for Europe and the United States is not clear. Mr. Gomes\u2019s leaked speech from inside Google sounded almost dystopian at times. \u201cThis is a world none of us have ever lived in before,\u201d Mr. Gomes told employees. \u201cAll I am saying, we have built a set of hacks, and we have kept them.\u201d He seemed to hint at scenarios the tech sector had never imagined before.

{"Headline": "The Week in Tech: Fears of the Supply Chain in China", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHello, everyone. I\u2019m Paul Mozur, a reporter based in Shanghai, and I have covered technology in Asia for eight years. Though lately the big story has been internet companies, hardware and the supply chain remains close to my heart. Maybe that\u2019s why the tech news bombshell a little over a week ago has been so fascinating to me.For years, China and the United States have squabbled over the supply chain, which sits mostly in China but is under the charge of companies from dozens of countries.The fact that the two sides share the same fears shows how difficult it can be to ensure security in a world in which the design, production and assembly of electronics occur across multiple countries.The American block on Huawei isn\u2019t completely effective against hypothetical supply chain hacks. That\u2019s because European and Japanese telecom equipment brands also have a good chunk of their supply chains in China. On the other hand, China\u2019s control of a huge portion of the supply chain doesn\u2019t ensure its security, because high-end design and production often happens elsewhere.Neither side is happy with this. Both China and the United States will probably continue to winnow their mutual tech reliance. It won\u2019t be easy. They are working against 40 years of economic integration and a tremendously complex web of big and small companies.A different approach would be to identify the key things that need to be protected. In a discussion I had the other day with Samm Sacks, a tech policy fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, she put forward the idea of having a \u201csmall yard and a high fence.\u201dThe point is to identify key products that cannot be compromised and come up with solutions to protect them. Obviously, companies should always do their best to ensure security. But that doesn\u2019t have to lead to ripping apart the global supply chain.For example, regular Americans shouldn\u2019t be too concerned about buying Huawei phones. Senators and admirals, on the other hand, should probably stick with something more closely guarded. That could involve building small, secure supply chains closer to home or special audits of phones used by people who could be high-profile targets. Even if it\u2019s a bit expensive.Either way, it\u2019s worth remembering that even if a brand of electronics is from one country, what\u2019s inside it could come from six others. Country of origin also doesn\u2019t ensure security.

{"Headline": "New Deal Brings More Women\u2019s Tennis to Tennis Channel", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs part of a lucrative five-year global television deal that provided a needed cash infusion in 2016, the WTA sold the rights to its overseas tennis tournaments to beIN Sports, beginning with the 2017 season.Eventually, WTA officials grew frustrated, too. The WTA cut short the United States portion of its worldwide rights deal with beIN Sports and returned to Tennis Channel in an agreement announced Monday.The new five-year deal with Tennis Channel includes television and digital streaming components, giving ample real estate to the WTA tour, which now produces television broadcasts of more than 2,000 matches annually. Tennis Channel also holds the U.S. rights to the men\u2019s tour.The WTA and beIN had mutually agreed to end the American part of its contract less than 18 months after it started. The WTA put its U.S. broadcast rights back on the market in June; its partnerships with beIN Sports continue elsewhere.\u201cBeIN has a heavy focus on its professional team sports, the soccer relationships that they have,\u201d said Steve Simon, the WTA\u2019s chief executive. \u201cSitting down and looking at their strategies and ours, they saw that this would probably be a better situation for the WTA long-term.\u201dBeIN Sports is available in less than half as many American homes as Tennis Channel. And with beIN Sports, many pivotal weekend semifinal and final matches were pre-empted by the network\u2019s soccer priorities.The highest-profile match during beIN Sports\u2019 tenure \u2014 Maria Sharapova\u2019s return from a doping suspension in April 2017 \u2014 was abandoned midway through the first set in favor of a soccer game. Last month, when Naomi Osaka took the court in front of a home crowd in Tokyo for her first match since winning the U.S. Open, beIN Sports was showing an infomercial featuring Larry King.Tennis Channel, which had held the WTA rights previously and continued to air American events, was awarded the rights over ESPN and Amazon, both of which would have focused more on streaming than television broadcasts.Tennis Channel had not come close to matching beIN Sports\u2019 bid in the previous rights cycle, offering less than 10 percent of what the Qatar-based network proffered.Simon said that money was not as primary of a concern at present as it returned to Tennis Channel.\u201cThis was not a financially driven discussion, at this point in time,\u201d he said.\u201cIt just seemed like it was more work to watch the WTA,\u201d Carmody said.Fans were more directly impacted by the problems than players, with occasional exceptions. Sloane Stephens, who missed the first six months of the 2017 season because of an injury, vented about beIN\u2019s spotty coverage when she returned to tour.\u201cHow annoying, you guys \u2014 I couldn\u2019t watch any tennis!\u201d Stephens said. \u201cI was so pissed. I was watching, and they cut to some soccer match. I was like, \u2018It\u2019s 3-all in the third, what are you guys doing?\u2019 It\u2019d make you do illegal stuff, going to watch on a stream or something.\u201dKen Solomon, chairman and chief executive of Tennis Channel, said any general sports network would struggle to give tennis the space it needs to flourish.\u201cIn tennis, the value is in the continuity,\u201d he said. \u201cThe storytelling from beginning of week to end of week is the key.\u201dSolomon said he heard frequent complaints from viewers who thought his network was making a concerted choice to show less women\u2019s tennis, not realizing coverage had moved to the more obscure beIN Sports.\u201cPeople just assumed that we had everything,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cThat expectation that we have everything is actually a responsibility.\u201dThe lack of visibility came at a time when women\u2019s tennis was in fascinating flux. Serena Williams, the sport\u2019s biggest star, has played few tournaments in recent years, and eight different women have won the last eight Grand Slam singles titles.Simon said that there were stipulations in the new deal with Tennis Channel to provide equitable coverage of men\u2019s and women\u2019s matches.\u201cWe\u2019ll be well represented,\u201d he said.Solomon said that his network had been \u201cnaturally gender neutral,\u201d given the comparable interest in men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis among his viewers.\u201cRegularly, our highest-rated matches are women\u2019s matches,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s just a given.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Microsoft\u2019s Earnings Surge, as Cloud Bet Continues to Pay Off", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Apple has its cash cow, the iPhone, which has made it the world\u2019s largest public company. Amazon transformed an array of industries, from logistics to the way consumers buy, to become the second largest. For Microsoft, which is gaining ground on Amazon, growth runs straight through the cloud.In the past several quarters, Microsoft\u2019s commercial cloud offerings have grown by big leaps, helping push the company\u2019s market cap to about $785 billion. On Wednesday, the company reported that the fast growth had continued in the latest quarter, as part of an earnings statement that beat analyst expectations and the company\u2019s own guidance across every segment of its business.Microsoft\u2019s first-quarter revenue was up 19 percent over the previous year, to $29.1 billion. Net income rose 34 percent, to $8.8 billion.\u201cWe are seeing larger and longer-term customer commitments to the cloud,\u201d said Amy Hood, the company\u2019s chief financial officer.Shares in the company rose as much as 4.6 percent in aftermarket trading, in response to the earnings. During market hours, shares had fallen more than 5 percent in a marketwide sell-off.\u201cIf you told an investor a few years ago that Microsoft is on the cusp of a $1 trillion market capitalization and could surpass Amazon, they\u2019d think you were crazy,\u201d said Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. \u201cIt speaks to how significant this cloud shift is, and what a strong hold Microsoft has on the cloud.\u201dWhen Satya Nadella became chief executive in 2014, Microsoft largely depended on selling its Windows operating system on personal computers, even as smartphones were ascendant. He shifted the company to focus much more on its cloud computing business.The breakneck growth of Azure, Microsoft\u2019s core cloud offering, slowed more in the most recent quarter than some analysts had expected. It was up 76 percent, after several quarters of being up from 85 to 98 percent. And Azure may not even be profitable, said Karl Keirstead, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, as the company heavily invests engineering resources in new products and the construction of new data centers around the globe.But analysts and investors say the company is well positioned for the increasingly popular approach called \u201chybrid cloud,\u201d which lets enterprises, like companies or government agencies, use one set of tools to manage what they store both on their own servers and on shared space in the cloud.\u201cMicrosoft is unique in the sense that it has the ability to play in both environments,\u201d said Sid Parakh, a portfolio manager in Seattle at Becker Capital, which invests in Microsoft. \u201cLegacy customers are already working on Microsoft products, and it provides a level of continuity to transition to the cloud.\u201dIn a call with analysts, Mr. Nadella said that \u201cwe don\u2019t think of hybrid as some stopgap to move to the cloud,\u201d and that Microsoft was investing in building out its hybrid offerings.\u201cThis is a place where we are leading,\u201d he said.The company\u2019s year-over-year growth in server products and cloud services was 28 percent, which Ms. Hood said was a sign that the company was meeting customer demand. That makes it \u201cnot a challenging decision\u201d to invest heavily in the cloud business, she said. And the company has money to spend in part because the legacy Windows business is still lucrative.\u201cThey have been telegraphing that Azure\u2019s profitability is improving, and that is enough,\u201d Mr. Keirstead said. \u201cIt is probably the most amazing growth engine we have seen inside Microsoft since basically the origins of the Windows business.\u201dAnother key part of the cloud transition is how Microsoft moved its suite of Office programs from software to the cloud, called Office 365. The product\u2019s revenue was up 36 percent in the first quarter.\u201cIt\u2019s not as sexy Azure, but it\u2019s really important,\u201d said Keith Weiss, a Morgan Stanley analyst. \u201cIt drives a lot of your profit.\u201dMr. Weiss said that once companies moved Office to the cloud, it was easier for Microsoft to sell them additional services, like video calls on Skype for Business or group chats on Microsoft Teams, a tool similar to the Slack messaging system.\u201cIf you can get someone to pay you 20 percent more by just switching on some functionality, that\u2019s great for you,\u201d Mr. Weiss said.Aside from the core cloud business, Ms. Hood said, gaming revenue increased 44 percent, outperforming expectations as Microsoft expands its gaming platform.\u201cFortnite is a key component of that, but it\u2019s not the only contributor,\u201d she said, referring to a popular game.LinkedIn revenue also had higher-than-expected revenue, up 33 percent over the previous year, as engagement increased.\u201cRight now, it's like they are firing on all cylinders,\u201d Mr. Ives of Wedbush said. \"The biggest risk to the name is that expectations have increased.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a popular video game. It is Fortnite, not Fortnight.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Internet Hacking Is About to Get Much Worse", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe can no longer leave online security to the market. Mr. Schneier is a fellow and lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School.The risks are about to get worse, because computers are being embedded into physical devices and will affect lives, not just our data. Security is not a problem the market will solve. The government needs to step in and regulate this increasingly dangerous space.The primary reason computers are insecure is that most buyers aren\u2019t willing to pay \u2014 in money, features, or time to market \u2014 for security to be built into the products and services they want. As a result, we are stuck with hackable internet protocols, computers that are riddled with vulnerabilities and networks that are easily penetrated. We have accepted this tenuous situation because, for a very long time, computer security has mostly been about data. Banking data stored by financial institutions might be important, but nobody dies when it\u2019s stolen. Facebook account data might be important, but again, nobody dies when it\u2019s stolen. Regardless of how bad these hacks are, it has historically been cheaper to accept the results than to fix the problems. But the nature of how we use computers is changing, and that comes with greater security risks. Many of today\u2019s new computers are not just screens that we stare at, but objects in our world with which we interact. A refrigerator is now a computer that keeps things cold; a car is now a computer with four wheels and an engine. These computers sense us and our environment, and they affect us and our environment. They talk to each other over networks, they are autonomous, and they have physical agency. They drive our cars, pilot our planes, and run our power plants. They control traffic, administer drugs into our bodies, and dispatch emergency services. These connected computers and the network that connects them \u2014 collectively known as \u201cthe internet of things\u201d \u2014 affect the world in a direct physical manner. These are problems that the market will not fix. Buyers can't differentiate between secure and insecure products, so sellers prefer to spend their money on features that buyers can see. The complexity of the internet and of our supply chains make it difficult to trace a particular vulnerability to a corresponding harm. The courts have traditionally not held software manufacturers liable for vulnerabilities. And, for most companies, it has generally been good business to skimp on security, rather than sell a product that costs more, does less, and is on the market a year later.Finally, we need to make it an overarching policy that security takes precedence over everything else. The internet is used globally, by everyone, and any improvements we make to security will necessarily help those we might prefer remain insecure: criminals, terrorists, rival governments. Here, we have no choice. The security we gain from making our computers less vulnerable far outweighs any security we might gain from leaving insecurities that we can exploit.Regulation is inevitable. Our choice is no longer between government regulation and no government regulation, but between smart government regulation and ill-advised government regulation. Government regulation is not something to fear. Regulation doesn\u2019t stifle innovation, and I suspect that well-written regulation will spur innovation by creating a market for security technologies. No industry has significantly improved the security or safety of its products without the government stepping in to help. Cars, airplanes, pharmaceuticals, consumer goods, food, medical devices, workplaces, restaurants, and, most recently, financial products \u2014 all needed government regulation in order to become safe and secure.Getting internet safety and security right will depend on people: people who are willing to take the time and expense to do the right things; people who are determined to put the best possible law and policy into place. The internet is constantly growing and evolving; we still have time for our security to adapt, but we need to act quickly, before the next disaster strikes. It\u2019s time for the government to jump in and help. Not tomorrow, not next week, not next year, not when the next big technology company or government agency is hacked, but now.

{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Presidential Race: Who\u2019s Ahead and What to Expect", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 There has been no lack of drama in the lead-up to Brazil\u2019s presidential election on Sunday. One candidate was jailed, another was stabbed and a week before the voting, women organized nationwide protests against the front-runner.The presidential contest, the most splintered and divisive race since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s, has for many Brazilians come down to who is the least bad option.The front-runner by a wide margin is the far-right former army captain, Jair Bolsonaro, according to the polls. A member of Congress since 1991, he was long a marginal figure best known for incendiary comments defending Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship and attacking women, gays and blacks.In addition to electing the next president from a field of 13 candidates, voters will also choose 27 governors and more than 1,600 state and federal lawmakers. In Brazil, there are 147.3 million eligible voters, and voting is obligatory.As anger and frustration with entrenched political corruption has grown, Mr. Bolsonaro has presented himself as an anti-establishment maverick who could effectively combat corruption and rein in soaring violence and crime.His main rival, former S\u00e3o Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, entered the race only last month. He was selected to represent the left-wing Workers\u2019 Party after the former president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, was sentenced to prison on corruption charges and barred from running as the party\u2019s candidate.Until the courts ruled him out, Mr. da Silva had been leading in the polls. But it appears that the Workers\u2019 Party has been unable to transfer Mr. da Silva\u2019s broad support among impoverished Brazilians to the less charismatic Mr. Haddad.The crowded field also includes Marina Silva, the daughter of Amazon rubber tappers; Geraldo Alckmin, the pragmatic and market-friendly former governor of S\u00e3o Paulo; and a candidate, Cabo Daciolo, who describes himself as a messenger from heaven.Still, some analysts think that Mr. Bolsonaro, 63, could defy the projections and emerge victorious on Sunday night despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 his lack of support from a major political party and a shoestring budget that relied on social media to build a base.Brazil uses an electronic ballot system and is expected to tally results within a couple of hours after polling stations close in the westernmost state of Acre at 6 p.m. Eastern Time.Soaring crime, the worst recession on record and institutionalized political corruption have been the three main issues in the campaign.Despite accomplishing little of note during his seven terms as a lawmaker, Mr. Bolsonaro gained prominence when a massive corruption investigation known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash, engulfed all of Brazil\u2019s major political parties.He cultivated an image as an abrasive, but honest politician with a clean record. This was in contrast with the Workers\u2019 Party, which has been largely blamed for the vast bribery schemes of the past decade and a half.Mr. Bolsonaro, who insists that he is the only candidate tough enough to stop criminals, has posed often for photos with his fingers pointed like loaded pistols. With his unfiltered comments and amateur videos on social media, he offered ready solutions for the country\u2019s problems: He wants to make it easier for citizens to own guns and for the police to shoot criminals.As his standing in the polls has improved, opponents rallied behind the motto #EleN\u00e3o, or #NotHim, taking to the streets and the internet to encourage voters to elect anyone but Mr. Bolsonaro.Brazil\u2019s sputtering economy has also divided voters. Many of the country\u2019s poorest people, who benefited from expanded social programs during Mr. da Silva\u2019s two terms as president, have embraced his stand-in, Mr. Haddad. The Workers\u2019 Party insisted that Mr. Haddad \u201cwould make Brazil happy again.\u201dBut many other voters blame the Workers\u2019 Party for the deep recession that started on its watch. Every time the polls show Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s popularity growing, the markets rally on the hope that he will curtail social spending and make fiscal changes.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters also worry that a victory for Mr. Haddad would deal a blow to the Car Wash investigation, which might lead to Mr. da Silva being freed from prison, despite his corruption conviction.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Google Faces Internal Backlash Over Handling of Sexual Harassment", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Google is struggling to contain a growing internal backlash over its handling of sexual harassment and its workplace culture.Google later said it had fired 48 people for sexual harassment over the last two years; none received an exit package. Mr. Page and Mr. Pichai also issued apologies, with Mr. Pichai later saying his initial statement \u201cwasn\u2019t enough\u201d and apologizing again. And one of the executives whom Alphabet continued employing after he was accused of harassment resigned on Tuesday and did not obtain an exit package.But employees\u2019 dissatisfaction has not subsided. On Thursday, more than 1,500 \u2014 most of them women \u2014 plan to walk out of almost two dozen company offices around the world to protest the treatment, organizers said.Google declined to comment.At a staff meeting last year, Google\u2019s founders, Mr. Page and Sergey Brin, also struggled to answer a question about who their female role models were, said two employees who saw a video of the meeting.Mr. Brin tried to recall the name of a woman he had recently met at a company event who had impressed him, the people said. Mr. Page eventually reminded Mr. Brin that the woman\u2019s name was Gloria Steinem, the feminist writer. Mr. Page said his hero was Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google and Alphabet, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly.Last week, The Times reported that Google had paid Andy Rubin, the creator of the Android mobile software, a $90 million exit package even after the company concluded that a harassment claim against him was credible. (Mr. Rubin has denied any misconduct and has said the report of his compensation is a \u201cwild exaggeration.\u201d) Google also paid millions of dollars in an exit package to another executive who was accused of harassment, and continued employing a third despite a harassment claim.\u201cI know this is really an exceptionally painful story for some of you, and I\u2019m really sorry for that,\u201d Mr. Page said at the time.The meeting did little to quell the anger. On Friday, Ms. Stapleton said, she created an internal mailing list to organize a walkout. More than 200 employees joined over the weekend, she said, and the numbers have since grown to more than 1,500.That same day, Mr. Pichai sent an apologetic email to employees saying he would support this week\u2019s protest. He said that some workers had already raised constructive ideas of how to improve policies around harassment and that he hoped to \u201cturn these ideas into action,\u201d according to the email, which was obtained by The Times.Employees organizing the walkout have called on Google to end the practice of private arbitration \u2014 which requires people to waive their right to sue and often includes confidentiality agreements \u2014 in cases of sexual assault and harassment. They also are demanding publication of a transparency report on instances of sexual harassment, more disclosure of salaries and compensation, an employee representative on the company\u2019s board and a chief diversity officer who could make recommendations directly to the board.Other employees said they were disappointed that senior executives such as David C. Drummond, Alphabet\u2019s chief legal officer, who had a child with a female subordinate, and Mr. Brin, who had a public extramarital relationship with an employee, remained in influential positions. Some raised questions about whether it was appropriate for Eric Schmidt, the company\u2019s former chief executive and chairman, to remain on Alphabet\u2019s board after former and current employees said he had retained a mistress as a company consultant.Thursday\u2019s walkout is set to begin in Google\u2019s Tokyo office and then circle the globe, with employees leaving work around 11 a.m. in their time zones, Ms. Stapleton said. People can choose whether or not to return to work, she said.\u201cWhile Google has championed the language of diversity and inclusion, substantive actions to address systemic racism, increase equity and stop sexual harassment have been few and far between. ENOUGH,\u201d organizers of the walkout wrote on an internal website, which was viewed by The Times. \u201cTime\u2019s up at Google.\u201dKate Conger and Daisuke Wakabayashi reported from San Francisco, and Katie Benner from Washington.Advertisement"}

(Tesla\u2019s shares plummeted on Friday, giving short sellers $1.3 billion in profit.)But how much will really change?The deal \u2014 which will now be called the \u201cUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement\u201d \u2014 includes big concessions:\u2022 Canada will ease protections on its dairy industry and give the U.S. more access to its markets.\u2022 The U.S. won\u2019t eliminate an independent tariff dispute system or impose auto tariffs on Canada. (Aluminum and steel ones may remain, though.)Sunday\u2019s breakthrough came after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada became involved in the talks over the weekend. He even asked Mexico, which had already reached an accord with the U.S., to intervene.The hacking is another headache for Facebook. The company has been buffeted over the last year by scandals including the abuse of user data and the manipulation of the social network for election meddling.California\u2019s new laws are tougher than those enacted by the Obama administration. They forbid internet service providers from intentionally slowing web services or blocking online content, and ban them from accepting money to make some services run faster.More on what it means, from Tony Romm and Brian Fung of the WaPo:The F.C.C.\u2019s efforts immediately put Washington on a collision course with the states. To start, more than 20 states filed lawsuits against the F.C.C., arguing that the agency had acted arbitrarily in repealing the net neutrality rules. Their efforts have won the support of companies like Mozilla and trade associations representing tech giants including Amazon, Facebook and Google.About 165 companies will be affected. Facebook and Tesla don\u2019t currently comply, for example, and will need at least three women on their board by 2021.The bill has detractors. Even Gov. Jerry Brown acknowledged that the law could face legal challenges.There was a sharp slowdown in business investment, caused by an interrelated weakening in emerging markets, a drop in the price of oil and other commodities, and a run-up in the value of the dollar. The pain was confined mostly to the energy and agricultural sectors and to the portions of the manufacturing economy that supply them with equipment.The mini-recession ended when China let banks borrow more and the Fed held interest rates steady. But Mr. Irwin notes that the dip may have had serious consequences \u2014 including making Donald Trump\u2019s economic message more attractive to those in the affected industries.\u2022 The median salary offer for a C.E.O. role at a Series C consumer products company is $325,000 in cash, with a 50 percent bonus and a 6 percent stock grant.\u2022 The median salary for a senior director of engineering at a young Series A start-up is about $200,000 in cash, with a 0.58 percent stock grant.Business Insider created interactive charts using the data, and they are worth studying to see how much these workers make \u2014 and how companies alter compensation as they get older.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: This Year\u2019s Stock Gains Are Wiped Out", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatt Phillips of the NYT explains what\u2019s driving the rout:Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.Either way, optimists may find solace in U.S. futures markets trading up slightly this morning, which hints at a brighter start for the day.More from Matt Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman of the NYT:China\u2019s effort is a 21st-century version of what officials there have been doing for many decades, which is trying to influence American leaders by cultivating an informal network of prominent businesspeople and academics who can be sold on ideas and policy prescriptions and then carry them to the White House. The difference now is that China, through its eavesdropping on Mr. Trump\u2019s calls, has a far clearer idea of who carries the most influence with the president, and what arguments tend to work.Combined with the eavesdropping is a lobbying effort by Beijing involving close Trump friends like Steve Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and Steve Wynn, the former casino magnate. One U.S. official told the NYT that the Chinese were pushing for those friends to persuade Mr. Trump to sit down with President Xi Jinping of China as often as possible.The profit will help stabilize Tesla\u2019s finances. But the question now is whether the automaker can continue this success. It has struggled to deliver cars to customers, and it hasn\u2019t yet rolled out its long-promised $35,000 Model 3. More from Mr. Boudette on what could yet happen:If sales falter, the company could quickly find itself in a financial squeeze. It has to make bond payments of $230 million in November and $920 million in March. It can use stock for the second payment but only if its share price is above $360. At the same time, Tesla hopes to build a factory in China, which will require hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenses.The suit, built on three years of investigations, does not charge the company with creating climate change. But it claims that the company essentially kept two sets of books when accounting for the effects of global warming: publicly, it claimed to be ready for stringent regulations, while internally it discounted potential costs of climate policies, prosecutors said. Executives as senior as Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon C.E.O. who later became President Trump\u2019s secretary of state, \u201cknew for years\u201d about the practice, the complaint said.An Exxon spokesman dismissed the lawsuit as \u201cbaseless.\u201d But as the NYT points out, New York attorneys general have had success bringing shareholder fraud lawsuits before, aided by the state\u2019s sweeping Martin Act.At stake isn\u2019t just hundreds of millions of dollars in punishment, but also a reputation that Exxon has tried to shape as a global leader on climate change issues.That starts with cars, said Mr. Khosrowshahi: \u201cIf there\u2019s one big goal for Uber, it\u2019s to replace car ownership.\u201d But Uber is also betting on bike and scooter rentals, food delivery, aircraft, and drones. The goal, he said, is to develop four or five multibillion-dollar businesses.That will come at a cost. Uber is at least a few years away from making money on ride-hailing, and investing in new technologies will require more cash. The company says revenue from mature markets is helping cover costs elsewhere, but prospective investors in its forthcoming I.P.O. will decide if that\u2019s enough to make a bet on its vision.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

But behind the drunken antics at the Deni Ute Muster, a network of friendship is lifting awareness of mental health issues.Supported byDENILIQUIN, Australia \u2014 It\u2019s been called the most debauched outdoor party in Australia: a wild, rollicking weekend where rural masculinity is on display and beer and banter flow endlessly.But for the Thompsons, the event carries more weight and meaning. They first went to the party, the Deni Ute Muster, three years ago, not long after losing their son, Bryan, to suicide.Bryan\u2019s mother, Lyn Thompson, 54, said she just knew it was his kind of festival. She pulled some faded pictures from her wallet, showing a son who had been eager to grow up, she said \u2014 a tall, 24-year-old bricklayer raising three children in small-town Australia with a heavy burden of responsibility.\u201cWhen we\u2019re here, he\u2019s with us,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re anywhere he\u2019s with us. But especially here.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not just a music festival,\u201d said Vicky Lowry, the Deni Ute Muster\u2019s general manager. \u201cIt is a celebration of rural Australia, it brings it all together.\u201dThat Aussie ideal was on display even before the festivities officially started as young men arrived in utes crammed with camping gear and beer, honking, whooping and waving from the windows.By last Friday morning, the area was blanketed with dust as utes skidded around in circles, with judges awarding points for skill and crowd reaction. Among the fans was a group of young men and women from a rural part of the state of Victoria. They had made bets on how many children would be conceived at the muster. \u201cI was being nice and said a thousand this year,\u201d said Karly Mitchell, 20.Many of their fathers were prone to bottling their emotions, they said, but among themselves there was a greater awareness of mental health issues. And technology, they said, was essential in their support networks.For some, the kind of communication fostered by internet access is hard to come by. At a bull-riding pen where young cowboys in bright shirts and white hats greased their ropes, I met Kurt Jamison, 24, who said he lived at a remote, 1,600-acre cattle station where until recently, there was no Wi-Fi. Sometimes, he said, he would go two weeks without seeing another person.\u201cYou end up talking to yourself,\u201d he said, as he leaned on the white gate bordering the bullpen. \u201cYou talk to your dogs.\u201dFor a few months last year, he said his depression worsened and he began drinking to cope with loneliness. But he said he was used to hiding his feelings. \u201cEven at school I was the school clown \u2014 but inside I was hating it,\u201d he said.\u201cI just messaged him back saying, \u2018Mate, everything\u2019s going to be all right,\u2019\u201d he said, a beer in hand. He said he stayed in touch with the man, just to see how things are going.\u201cThey just think we\u2019re all ferals,\u201d he said, referring to people who saw the festival as nothing more than a rowdy beerfest. \u201cBut really, you come here, it\u2019s just a good atmosphere. It\u2019s lovely.\u201dThe festival\u2019s endurance may lie in its adaptability. In the last few years, it has leaned toward being more family focused, inviting a wider scope of musicians and providing more activities. It has also limited the amount of alcohol allowed in and is now working more closely with the local police.\u201cWe\u2019ve had to evolve and move with the times,\u201d said Ms. Lowry, the festival\u2019s general manager.Many of the farmers who attended looked pleased, though in some cases the openness seemed limited to the muster itself. Feelings of discontent were evident among the crowd, which was overwhelmingly white. More than a few people had tags on their hats with a pointed message: \u201cOur land, our country, our way.\u201d In some conversations, pride and struggle had a way of edging into populist nationalism.\u201cThis is the worst season of drought we\u2019ve had for a long time. How many nations overseas have offered aid to our farmers?\u201d said Jamie Heyde, an ex-serviceman with a bear tattoo on his arm and an Amazon Kindle on his thigh. \u201cYou don\u2019t sit there and help someone else out if your footing is crumbling beneath you,\u201d he added.Mr. Heyde, who said he voted for Senator Pauline Hanson \u2014 Australia\u2019s main right-wing populist politician \u2014 said that he does not have a problem with immigration. But immigrants should be aware that they are \u201cAustralian first and foremost,\u201d he said.Later that night, Ms. Underwood, the American country star, sang of cowboys, mothers, love and land. For those at the show, just being with so many people from similar backgrounds seemed to be a relief.There were no cows to be milked and no sheep to be shorn, no drought to worry over. Thousands of people roamed the ute paddock. Dozens of fires sent up black smoke as men revved their utes until they backfired.More quietly, men and women in scuffed jeans could be seen taking pictures of the sunset and offering each other beers. They cheered as a woman in a pink vest, who produced a pair of bagpipes, began playing \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d\u201cThis is my main family. This is a family section to me,\u201d Rhys Martini, 24, said hoarsely as he stood in front of his ute, which had a row of bras across the bumper. \u201cReal brothers and sisters here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Bloomberg, strolling the Google grounds with Sergey Brin and dining with Rupert Murdoch. Built into the narrative was a mostly cheerful acceptance of the story Crown Prince Mohammed was selling about himself \u2014 that here, at last, was the modern Middle Eastern leader the West had been waiting for.That story started to crack apart on Oct. 2, when the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a sharp critic of the Saudi government, walked into the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul and didn\u2019t walk out.The apparent hit was part of a progression that was underway long before Crown Prince Mohammed\u2019s charm campaign, which made him out to be not some ruthless royal, but a youthful reformer who had granted Saudi women the right to drive and lifted the country\u2019s 35-year ban on movie theaters (a potential jackpot for Hollywood).Mr. Emanuel, an organizer of the evening, had reason to celebrate: the Saudis planned a $400 million investment in Endeavor, his entertainment holding company. (In light of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, Endeavor is reassessing the deal, according to a person with knowledge of Mr. Emanuel\u2019s thinking, who shared it only on condition of anonymity.)And suddenly the \u201cM.B.S.\u201d moniker took on a grim new meaning among the plugged-in set of Washington: Mister Bone Saw.Sherif Mansour, the director of the committee\u2019s Middle East and North Africa program, told me he took a dim view of the news media\u2019s more credulous accounts of Crown Prince Mohammed.\u201cWe have been beside ourselves,\u201d Mr. Mansour said.

It was 100 pages of Saudi cotton candy, filled with splashy photos of the crown prince smiling serenely beneath his checkered headgear here, shaking hands with President Trump there. The publication called him a \u201cdecisive leader prepared to back words with action.\u201dIt\u2019s just that there\u2019s a streak in American journalism to allow glittering narratives about budding authoritarians to obscure less appealing facts.Advertisement"}

Shamelessly lurid, it\u2019s also his best.That \u201cPeeping Tom\u201d awards Philip, who is African-American, dinner for two at a tacky theme restaurant called the African Room suggests that, like De Palma\u2019s early independent films, \u201cSisters\u201d will have elements of social satire; that Philip invites Danielle to dine with him raises the ante, not least by introducing her creepy \u201cex-husband\u201d (the frequent De Palma collaborator William Finley); that Danielle turns out to have a twin complicates everything.Although some mistakenly credited a \u201crave\u201d review of \u201cSisters\u201d by The New Yorker critic Pauline Kael with launching Mr. De Palma\u2019s Hollywood career, her notice was actually an unequivocal pan: \u201c\u2018Sisters,\u2019\u201d she wrote, \u201cis a long way from being the brilliant thriller the ads say it is, but its limp technique doesn\u2019t seem to matter to the people who want their gratuitous gore.\u201dHitchcock was a master of dark humor.

Presupposing the viewer\u2019s knowledge of \u201cPsycho,\u201d \u201cSisters\u201d is something like a jaded, politicized remake, reflecting post-1960s disillusionment. The film scholar Chris Dumas points out that De Palma\u2019s substitutions are crucial. His psychotic killer is a white woman and, rather than the ambivalent adulteress of \u201cPsycho,\u201d the victim is a black man (a role De Palma optimistically hoped might attract Sidney Poitier). The only witness to the murder is a 25-year-old would-be muckraking reporter for a neighborhood weekly (Jennifer Salt), widely disbelieved by investigators because of her articles on police brutality.Once this allegorical setup is grasped, the journalist\u2019s fate, the disposition of the corpse and the movie\u2019s final shot make for a thriller that, while lesser than Hitchcock\u2019s, is more brutally cynical and despairing.Rewind is an occasional column covering revived, restored and rediscovered movies playing in New York\u2019s repertory theaters.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Apple Used to Know Exactly What People Wanted \u2014 Then It Made a Watch", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyApple opened a routine product-launch event last month with a gag. An establishing aerial shot of Apple\u2019s new circular headquarters set up a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-inspired video sketch: The keynote speech is about to start, and it\u2019s an emergency. A young woman is summoned into action, clutching a metallic briefcase while running, jumping, tripping and sliding her way out of the sparsely inhabited mile-round structure where she works. This rush across Apple\u2019s depopulated futurescape is interrupted by an Apple Watch notifying our hero that she had completed her activity goal for the day; she runs into a colleague who uses his to teleport. The real punch line arrives when she delivers her package to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Tim Cook \u2014 and it\u2019s not a new product, but the remote control he needs for his presentation.The subtext, in this now-customary display of self-deprecation, is that Apple, which saw its market capitalization pass $1 trillion in August this year, doesn\u2019t quite know what to do with itself. Steve Jobs was fond of pointing out the limits of market research. Customers \u201cdon\u2019t know what they want until we\u2019ve shown them,\u201d he would say, sometimes invoking a (probably apocryphal) adage from Henry Ford: If he had asked people what they wanted, \u201cthey would have said, \u2018Faster horses.\u2019\u2009\u201d Whether we understand this sentiment as an actual operating principle or as self-aggrandizing narrative, it does not quite account for what has become of Apple in the post-Jobs era.The company never achieved true dominance until the staggering rise of the iPhone, which was a Jobs-era project, but the iPhone itself didn\u2019t succeed until after Apple relinquished its total control over it. At launch, Jobs imagined the device as a phone that could go to websites. There were no third-party apps. Today, however, we associate our smartphones with the apps we use on them. They\u2019re for Instagram or Facebook; they\u2019re for WhatsApp, or for buying things on Amazon, or for checking your Gmail. They belong, in other words, to the internet giants, some of which are Apple\u2019s competitors and together dominate the time we spend with Apple\u2019s core product. In a bid to show people what they wanted, Jobs ended up creating perhaps history\u2019s most efficient tool for simply asking them, and then letting others supply the answers.The Apple Watch, a new version of which was announced at the event, was initially pitched, in 2014, as a salve for the excesses of your iPhone. Just as Apple had lost control of its iPhone to the invasive, distracting internet companies, those customers had lost control over their own experiences. The Apple Watch \u2014 with its smaller screen and emphasis on checking rather than interacting \u2014 was pitched with marketing that evoked adventure, activity and, above all, escape, as much from work or home as from the iPhone itself.Four years and millions of sales later, the Apple-Watch-as-iPhone-antidote pitch remains, as do its use cases as fitness and health devices. More important is what hasn\u2019t yet happened. Whether by accident or by design, the watch has so far been immune to the runaway success that redefined the iPhone. Apple is still in the process \u2014 and still in charge \u2014 of guessing what most people could get out of an Apple Watch. It\u2019s a device that is neither a simple reflection of pre-emptive market research nor a product reshaped by its own popularity. What future it may have still belongs to Apple. And this appears to be making the company anxious.During the presentation, executives shared glimpses of a lifestyle that was very obviously, as the product inscriptions say, \u201cDesigned by Apple in California\u201d \u2014 attractive human bodies propelling themselves up and down mountains, surfacing between waves or wending through their local picturesque countryside. It\u2019s the sort of destination recreation you might only daydream about at the office until you\u2019re snapped out of it by your regular Apple Watch reminder to stand up \u2014 that is, unless you live in the Bay Area and work at a place like Apple. New iPhone announcements may have been reduced to faster-horse affairs, but at least Apple doesn\u2019t have to guess who, or what, smartphones are for.Over the years, iPhones have become more aware of the world around them, laden with new sensors and microphones and cameras. The Apple Watch is becoming, with each generation, better at sensing what\u2019s going on with, and inside, its wearers\u2019 bodies. Apple boasts that its latest model introduces a functioning electrocardiogram, or EKG, widening the scope of the device\u2019s body monitoring well beyond elective physical activities or passive quantification and into active diagnosis. (The function won\u2019t be available until later this year.) The Apple Watch can warn when a wearer\u2019s heart rate has dipped too low, or jumped too high; the Series 4 can ask, when it senses an abrupt movement, if you might have fallen, offering to call an ambulance.For now, this impressive facility for collecting and organizing information about you is just that \u2014 it\u2019s a great deal of data with not many places to go. This is sensitive information, of course, and Apple\u2019s relative commitment to privacy \u2014 at least compared with advertising-centric companies like Google and Facebook \u2014 might be enough to get new users strapped in and recording.As Apple continues its institutional struggle to conceive of what the Apple Watch is, or could be, in the imaginations of its customers, it\u2019s worth remembering that Apple\u2019s stated commitment to privacy is, in practice, narrow. The competitors that Cook likes to prod about their data-exploitative business models have a necessary and complicit partner in his company, having found many of their customers though Apple\u2019s devices and software.This is especially relevant as Apple casts about for ideas elsewhere. Apple has already met with the insurance giant Aetna about ways in which the company might use Apple Watches to encourage healthier \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 behavior in its tens of millions of customers. John Hancock, one of the largest life insurers in America, said after Apple\u2019s latest announcement that it would offer all its customers the option of an interactive policy, in which customers would get discounts for healthy habits, as evidenced by data from wearable devices. Here we see the vague outlines of how the Apple Watch could become vital, or at least ubiquitous, as the handmaiden to another data-hungry industry.There may be many other ways, still, that the Apple Watch can fulfill its presumed destiny as the next device that we suddenly can\u2019t remember a world without. It would be out of character for Apple to admit that the iPhone, its biggest success, was in reality a triumph of mass-market research, and to announce its intentions to do it all again, letting others figure out the real value of its device \u2014 or, more specifically, the value of the user data it could provide. Apple is left still guessing, with more persistence than confidence, what customers might not yet know they want. Meanwhile, the market is watching, and coming up with its own answers.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Liberal San Francisco, Tech Leaders Brawl Over Tax Proposal to Aid Homeless", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJack Dorsey, chief executive of Twitter and Square, is among the technology executives who have been fiercely opposed to a Nov. 6 ballot measure that would impose a new tax on companies.For months, technology companies in San Francisco have fought a local ballot proposition that would impose taxes on corporations to fund initiatives to help the homeless.But last week, that unified front crumbled when Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, the online software company that is the city\u2019s largest private employer, broke from the pack. \u201cHomelessness is all of our responsibility,\u201d he tweeted. Then the billionaire committed $2 million to passing the tax measure and criticized his fellow tech moguls for not caring.The vitriol among tech executives over the proposition has become \u201cawkward,\u201d said Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator who represents San Francisco and surrounding areas and who is against the tax. Still, he praised the companies for becoming more involved in local politics.The dispute over Proposition C raises the question of what responsibilities tech companies have for problems in their own backyards. Tech firms often receive blame for exacerbating inequality and driving up property values with their hefty employee pay packages, contributing to homelessness. The question of what these companies may owe their hometowns is magnified because many of them have taken advantage of local tax breaks to spur their own growth.\u201cI\u2019m down to help in any way I can, as long as the mayor has the accountability,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said in an interview. He added that he was not worried about being perceived as opposing support for the homeless, \u201cbecause it feels like the right thing to do to get into the nuance and bring out more of the concerns.\u201dThose in favor of the new tax argue that they are not asking tech companies to come up with a strategy to save the homeless. Instead, they said, they simply want to raise taxes on the firms to fund resources. The extra money from the proposition could total $300 million a year and would effectively double the city\u2019s budget for addressing homelessness.\u201cYou\u2019re either for the homeless or you\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Benioff said in an interview. \u201cEveryone is willing to say it\u2019s a terrible problem and it\u2019s getting worse, but only so many are willing to write a check to make it better.\u201dSam Lew, policy director of the Coalition on Homelessness, said the proposition was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d because the funding would provide housing.The measure qualified for the city ballot in July. Polling conducted by the opposition campaign in early September indicated that 56 percent of likely voters favored the tax, but that number decreased to 47 percent when they received opposition messaging.In August, an executive at Dolby Laboratories, which makes entertainment systems, sent an email to more than 30 technology companies in San Francisco about the measure, asking if they planned to take a stand on it. Other companies on the email included Salesforce, Stripe, Twitter, GitHub, Uber, Lyft, Zendesk, Slack and Yelp.Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, who favors the measure, said in an interview: \u201cYou are either for the homeless or you\u2019re not.\u201dExecutives at Salesforce and Stripe said they would most likely oppose the measure, according to the emails, which were obtained by The New York Times.In one email, Darryl Yee, Salesforce\u2019s tax chief, said: \u201cI grew up in SF and very much want to address the homeless problem, but the city\u2019s budget already seems pretty healthy, especially when you consider we\u2019re only a population of 800K.\u201dMichael Yip, Stripe\u2019s head of tax, wrote back that tech companies might make sizable charitable donations to homelessness causes instead, \u201cin hopes that this will be enough to sway the Mayor to publicly oppose this.\u201dTwitter and Zendesk declined to comment. GitHub and Lyft did not return requests for comment. Yelp said it was \u201cnot active\u201d on the issue.Patrick Collison, Stripe\u2019s chief executive, later tweeted that the measure was \u201cpoor policy.\u201dIn a statement on Friday, Stripe said that homelessness was complex and that \u201csolutions require careful interventions.\u201d It added, \u201cAnyone who claims that Prop C is a matter of being \u2018for the homeless or against them\u2019 is selling a facile falsehood.\u201dMr. Benioff said early conversations within Salesforce focused on opposing the tax since \u201call companies are supposed to oppose all taxes. You kind of learn that in business school.\u201d But he changed his mind after talking with his co-chief executive, Keith Block, who often encountered homeless people on his walks to work.\u201cWe said, you know what, I think we have to support this,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. He added that homelessness \u2014 not taxes \u2014 had become an existential threat to business in the city and that Salesforce might have to leave if the crisis continued.On Oct. 8, Mr. Benioff announced his $2 million commitment to passing the measure and tweeted his support for the tax.In response, Mr. Dorsey tweeted his opposition. Mr. Benioff then questioned Mr. Dorsey\u2019s philanthropy; Mr. Dorsey insisted that Mr. Benioff reread his arguments.Mr. Dorsey now plans to give $75,000 to the campaign against the tax, a Square spokesman said. The funding would help spread a more nuanced message about the ballot initiative, Mr. Dorsey said.Stripe has also recently donated an additional $400,000 to the campaign against the tax, according to public records. Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital, gave $100,000, according to public records. In an email, Mr. Moritz said he agreed with Stripe\u2019s stance on the measure and noted that his foundation had recently given $11 million to Hamilton Families, an organization fighting homelessness.Cisco\u2019s chief executive, Chuck Robbins, spoke in support of Mr. Benioff in a statement this week, saying, \u201cWe must end the homelessness and housing crises our communities are facing.\u201d He said he was supporting a proposition to fund affordable housing in San Jose, Calif., where Cisco has its headquarters.In a phone call after their Twitter exchange, Mr. Benioff said, Mr. Dorsey told him that the tax in Proposition C was too high. Mr. Dorsey said he had merely pointed out the disproportionate impact that the tax would have on payment processors like Square. Mr. Benioff estimated Salesforce would pay $10 million annually for the tax; Mr. Dorsey said Square, a much smaller company, would pay $20 million.Mr. Benioff has since continued taking digs at other San Francisco tech leaders and their stance on Proposition C. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know they didn\u2019t like it until they realized I supported it,\u201d he said.Mr. Dorsey, when asked if he agreed with Mr. Benioff\u2019s characterization of their conversation, responded with a single word: \u201cNo.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tesla Faces a Challenger in the Home Solar Business", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 Just four years after its founding in 2006, SolarCity had emerged as the nation\u2019s leading rooftop solar power company. The company\u2019s founders, with the help of their billionaire cousin, Elon Musk, set out to be the vanguard of an age in which consumers weaned themselves from dependence on utilities for their electricity.In the short term, the biggest competition is coming from Sunrun, an installer of residential solar panels and energy storage that is capturing a growing amount of what had been SolarCity\u2019s signature market.\u201cIt is all but guaranteed that Sunrun will emerge as the top residential solar installer in the U.S.,\u201d said Allison Mond, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, which provides consulting on various issues including energy and renewables. \u201cTesla\u2019s residential solar business is in rapid decline as the company has cut many sales channels.\u201dWood Mackenzie, which tracks and supplies solar data for the Solar Energy Industries Association, says Tesla accounts for 9.3 percent of residential solar installations nationwide this year, followed by Sunrun at 9.0 percent, in a fragmented industry. In 2015, SolarCity had one-third of the market while Sunrun had 5 percent.Since the acquisition of SolarCity, Tesla has worked to present itself as a one-stop shop for a homeowner\u2019s needs \u2014 an electric car in the garage, solar panels on the roof, and a battery called the Powerwall storing energy to help power both the car and the home. Tesla also makes a battery system it sells commercially and to utilities, called the Powerpack. The Powerpack stores energy from the electric grid as well as power collected from solar arrays larger than systems designed for home use.In the third quarter, the company\u2019s noncar battery business, as measured in megawatts, more than doubled from the same quarter a year earlier. But its solar installations, also measured in megawatts, have declined sharply. To match last year\u2019s installations, Tesla would have to sell twice as much in the fourth quarter as it did in the first three quarters combined.Sunrun says it has already surpassed Tesla, if the installations it finances through third-party contractors are counted. That could bring Sunrun\u2019s market share for residential installations to as much as 15 percent.Sunrun, founded in 2007 and based in San Francisco, says it has sold more than $3 billion in installed solar systems. Lynn Jurich, Sunrun\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, said her company recently expanded into seven new markets and now has a presence in 22 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.Part of Sunrun\u2019s strategy has been to stay focused on financing and installing solar panels and batteries rather than producing those products itself.Ms. Jurich said, \u201cManufacturing, that\u2019s not our core competency.\u201dNew opportunities for both companies are opening up, especially in California, which is already the nation\u2019s leader in solar installations and is adding new mandates and incentives.Analysts say prices for comparable residential solar systems at Sunrun and Tesla are about the same. But as they move to take advantage of the growing appeal of home solar power, the companies are pursuing divergent paths.Visitors to Tesla\u2019s showroom in Burbank, Calif., will find a Model X and Model S parked on the showroom floor while a Powerwall and a single solar panel are displayed on a wall. A video shows how the products can be integrated.The approach of using Tesla stores replaced a long-established sales strategy that focused on a partnership with Home Depot in which Tesla representatives sold solar panels at the hardware giant\u2019s retail outlets. Tesla says selling its products under one roof \u201cwill save money and enable our colleagues to work together more effectively and efficiently.\u201dBut the partnership approach seems to suit Sunrun, which lacks its own showrooms and has struck a relationship with another giant retailer, Costco.That\u2019s where Ed Hanlon, of Carlsbad, Calif., recently encountered a Sunrun sales representative. After researching the company, Mr. Hanlon, 72, decided to buy a 7.5-kilowatt solar power system, including a battery, that workers began installing this month.\u201cWe live in California, so sunshine is a given,\u201d said Mr. Hanlon, a retired Marine. But what pushed him to go solar was frustration with the rate increases by his power company, San Diego Gas and Electric, over the last couple of years.\u201cI thought: \u2018O.K., what can we do to kind of dampen that down?\u2019\u201d Mr. Hanlon said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a feel-good part of it.\u201dNeither Sunrun nor Tesla makes its own solar panels. Tesla has a deal with Panasonic to make panels at Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo but uses other suppliers as well. Tesla manufactures all of its other products, including parts for installing the systems.The foreign origin of many panels has been a handicap for the industry since President Trump imposed tariffs on their import this year. Sunrun says that the tariffs have not slowed its business, while Tesla declined to comment about the impact.Sunrun\u2019s revenue in 2017 was $533 million, up from $477 million in 2016. Tesla\u2019s revenue from electricity generation and storage last year was $1.1 billion, but that includes some commercial and utility-scale products.Even with the traction that Sunrun has gotten, Tesla says it is intent on pushing ideas that are untested or have yet to gain widespread adoption or success.And it is building out its leadership team with the recent arrival of Sanjay Shah, who helped with growth and development at Dell and Amazon, as the senior vice president of Tesla Energy.\u201cCompetition is always healthy,\u201d Mr. Shah said in an interview, but he said Tesla and Sunrun were fundamentally different.\u201cInstead of focusing on the competition and the markets, we are focusing on where the world is going,\u201d he said. \u201cThe growth in terms of market share is just a matter of time. Our energy business will continue to grow, and it will be as big as our auto business.\u201dBut Vikram Aggarwal, the co-founder and chief executive of EnergySage, a solar comparison-shopping service, said Tesla\u2019s self-contained approach had made it challenging for Mr. Musk to execute his vision.\u201cThey wanted to be a fully vertically integrated product, manufacturing and installation company,\u201d Mr. Aggarwal said. \u201cThat is a very, very expensive strategy to implement where you have so many components. For one company to be really good at all of it is very difficult.\u201dMr. Shah described the changes as strategic moves to improve efficiency. Customers, he said, will ultimately visit and keep returning to Tesla stores because of the experience they will find in search of products to power their lives. \u201cWhen customers think renewable energy, they should think about electric vehicles, solar and battery \u2014 not just solar and a battery,\u201d he said.While Tesla announced a 9 percent job reduction across all its businesses in June, it has been hiring more installers and electricians to ramp up its solar power and energy storage business.The crown jewel of Tesla\u2019s solar products was supposed to be glass solar shingles that would be more visually appealing than the rectangular panels that sit on rooftops. Many people find boxy solar panels unattractive on roofs with ceramic barrel tiles, or simply don\u2019t like puncturing holes in their shingles to install panels.Mr. Musk promised to deliver the shingles at a price comparable to replacing a normal roof. But like other Tesla products, the shingles have been delayed, which the company attributed to their complexity. It said last week that it expected to ramp up production in the first half of next year.Mr. Musk\u2019s cousin Lyndon Rive, a co-founder and former chief executive of SolarCity, says he is optimistic about Tesla\u2019s long-term leadership in the solar and storage business. \u201cTesla is going to continue innovating and creating services,\u201d he said.Mr. Rive, who created SolarCity with his brother Peter in 2006, joined Tesla after his company was acquired. But the two left after a few months for undisclosed reasons.Mr. Rive acknowledged the delivery struggles that Tesla often experiences with its products. But he said the company would ultimately prevail in the solar and storage market.\u201cYes, they do have the ramp-up challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they solve them. They always do.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "CVS Health and Aetna $69 Billion Merger Is Approved With Conditions", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut a combined CVS-Aetna may be even more formidable. As the last major free-standing pharmacy manager, CVS Health had revenues of about $185 billion last year, and provided prescription plans to roughly 94 million customers. Aetna, one of the nation\u2019s largest insurers with about $60 billion in revenue last year, covers 22 million people in its health plans.But critics worry that consumers could end up with far fewer options and higher expenses.\u201cThis type of consolidation in a market already dominated by a few, powerful players presents the very real possibility of reduced competition that harms consumer choice and quality,\u201d George Slover, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union, an advocacy group, said in a statement.The consumer organization had opposed the Aetna-CVS merger, arguing that people enrolled in Aetna health plans could be forced to seek care at CVS retail clinics, and that those who were not insured by Aetna could pay higher prices for drugs than those who were.\u201cThe combination of CVS and Aetna creates an enormous market force that we haven\u2019t seen before,\u201d Mr. Slover said.The Justice Department had undertaken an antitrust review of these types of deals, approving many because they involve distinct businesses. It granted conditional approval to the CVS-Aetna deal as long as Aetna sold off its private Medicare drug plans.Amid the growing outcry over the high price of medicines, pharmacy managers have been vilified alongside big drug makers. Critics say pharmacy managers\u2019 secretive deals \u2014 under which price-setting strategies are not publicly disclosed \u2014 enrich companies on all sides of the prescription drug pipeline while failing to benefit consumers.\u201cThere are going to be mammoth organizations,\u201d said Adam J. Fein, the chief executive of Drug Channels Institute, a research firm.Now that generic drugs account for about 90 percent of all prescriptions, the role of pharmacy benefit managers, known as P.B.M.\u2019s, has changed over time, with higher drug prices largely a product of the increase in expensive specialty medicines for conditions like rheumatoid arthritis or cancer.\u201cThe job of the P.B.M. is being transformed,\u201d Mr. Fein said.The companies \u201care feeling pressure to do something different or it will be done to them,\u201d said Brian Marcotte, the chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers.\u201cIt\u2019s a disruptive period of time when the players are rearranging themselves,\u201d said David W. Johnson, the chief executive of 4sight Health, a consultant.Five state attorneys general \u2014 from California, Florida, Hawaii, Mississippi, and Washington \u2014 joined with the Justice Department in conditionally approving the Aetna-CVS deal. The merger is expected to be finalized sometime before the end of the year.Previous mergers in the industry have left consumers with fewer choices and higher drug bills, said David A. Balto, an antitrust lawyer who is a critic of the pharmacy managers.\u201cThis is a marketplace that hasn\u2019t done well because of lack of transparency, and transparency may be even weaker,\u201d said Mr. Balto, who had worked at the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department. Affiliations with large insurers could change that dynamic, he added. \u201cIt might correct some of the more pernicious practices.\u201dMr. Balto warned that while state officials have not traditionally overseen pharmacy managers, the combined mammoths \u201ccould bring them into the cross hairs of regulation.\u201dThe mergers also show how far organizations are crossing the traditional line between insurance companies responsible for paying for care and providers responsible for delivering it.\u201cThe nature of the last six to 12 months is much more vertical and the size of the deals are significantly larger,\u201d said Gurpreet Singh, a partner specializing in health care services at the consulting and advisory firm PwC.Much of the enthusiasm over CVS\u2019s acquisition of Aetna has focused on the insurer\u2019s addition of a retail component and the potential use of CVS\u2019s 10,000 pharmacies and 1,100 retail clinics to deliver care, particularly to Aetna customers.Imagine a single hub where someone can go to get care for everything from a sore throat to their diabetes. CVS stores could become places to get blood tests for monitoring chronic conditions, not just toothpaste or prescription refills. \u201cYou could see the store as a base of operations for a lot of these delivery channels,\u201d said George Hill, a senior analyst at RBC Capital Markets.Mr. Merlo will be the chief executive of the combined companies, and Mark T. Bertolini, Aetna\u2019s chief executive, will step down and join the CVS board. CVS has committed to keeping Aetna at its headquarters in Hartford for the next decade.\u201cIn our new health care model, we provide people access to more affordable care when, where and how they need it,\u201d Mr. Merlo said. \u201cCare will be coordinated among the health care providers, caregivers and their health care teams, leveraging the connectivity CVS will provide.\u201dMr. Hill said CVS was also well situated for any incursion by newcomers like Amazon. In addition to the regulatory hurdles such entrants would have to scale to sell prescription drugs, people typically buy medicine from drugstore or mail-order companies dictated by their health plan.\u201cYou\u2019re going to go where your payer has told you to go,\u201d Mr. Hill said.It may be years before it is clear whether Aetna and CVS can succeed in changing how their businesses operate.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opportunity,\u201d Mr. Marcotte said, but warned that the size of the combined companies makes it even more challenging. \u201cThese big mergers take a while to integrate,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bruno Latour, the Post-Truth Philosopher, Mounts a Defense of Science", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "He spent decades deconstructing the ways that scientists claim their authority. Can his ideas help them regain that authority today?Supported byStill, Latour had never seen himself as doing anything so radical, or absurd, as calling into question the existence of reality. As a founder of the new academic discipline of science and technology studies, or S.T.S., Latour regarded himself and his colleagues as allies of science. Of course he believed in reality, he told the psychologist, convinced that the conversation was in jest. From the look of relief on the man\u2019s face, however, Latour realized that the question had been posed in earnest. \u201cI had to switch interpretations fast enough to comprehend both the monster he was seeing me as,\u201d he later wrote of the encounter, \u201cand his touching openness of mind in daring to address such a monster privately. It must have taken courage for him to meet with one of these creatures that threatened, in his view, the whole establishment of science.\u201dThose who worried that Latour\u2019s early work was opening a Pandora\u2019s box may feel that their fears have been more than borne out. Indeed, commentators on the left and the right, possibly overstating the reach of French theory, have recently leveled blame for our current state of affairs at \u201cpostmodernists\u201d like Latour. By showing that scientific facts are the product of all-too-human procedures, these critics charge, Latour \u2014 whether he intended to or not \u2014 gave license to a pernicious anything-goes relativism that cynical conservatives were only too happy to appropriate for their own ends. Latour himself has sometimes worried about the same thing. As early as 2004 he publicly expressed the fear that his critical \u201cweapons,\u201d or at least a grotesque caricature of them, were being \u201csmuggled\u201d to the other side, as corporate-funded climate skeptics used arguments about the constructed nature of knowledge to sow doubt around the scientific consensus on climate change.But Latour believes that if the climate skeptics and other junk scientists have made anything clear, it\u2019s that the traditional image of facts was never sustainable to begin with. \u201cThe way I see it, I was doing the same thing and saying the same thing,\u201d he told me, removing his glasses. \u201cThen the situation changed.\u201d If anything, our current post-truth moment is less a product of Latour\u2019s ideas than a validation of them. In the way that a person notices her body only once something goes wrong with it, we are becoming conscious of the role that Latourian networks play in producing and sustaining knowledge only now that those networks are under assault.This, in essence, is the premise of Latour\u2019s latest book, \u201cDown to Earth,\u201d an illuminating and counterintuitive analysis of the present post-truth moment, which will be published in the United States next month. What journalists, scientists and other experts fail to grasp, Latour argues, is that \u201cfacts remain robust only when they are supported by a common culture, by institutions that can be trusted, by a more or less decent public life, by more or less reliable media.\u201d With the rise of alternative facts, it has become clear that whether or not a statement is believed depends far less on its veracity than on the conditions of its \u201cconstruction\u201d \u2014 that is, who is making it, to whom it\u2019s being addressed and from which institutions it emerges and is made visible. A greater understanding of the circumstances out of which misinformation arises and the communities in which it takes root, Latour contends, will better equip us to combat it.Latour likes to say that he has been attuned from an early age to the ways in which human beings influence their natural environment. His affluent family, proprietors of the prominent winemaking business Maison Louis Latour, had been cultivating the same Burgundy vineyards for more than 150 years when Bruno, the youngest of eight children, was born there in 1947. An older brother was already being groomed to run the family firm, so Latour was encouraged to pursue a classical education. At 17, he was sent to Saint-Louis de Gonzague, one of the most prestigious schools in Paris, where he mingled with other young members of the French elite. Although he was a wealthy and well-read Catholic, he found himself completely unprepared for the virulent snobbery of the capital. He was made to feel like the proud, provincial hero of a Balzac novel who arrives in Paris and soon discovers how little he knows about the ways of the world. It was at Saint-Louis de Gonzague that he began to study philosophy, a compulsory subject in the final year of French high school. The first text he was assigned was Nietzsche\u2019s \u201cThe Birth of Tragedy\u201d; unlike \u201call the confusion of mathematics,\u201d it immediately struck him as clear and perfectly rational.In 1966, he began his undergraduate study at the University of Dijon, where he developed an interest in epistemology \u2014 the branch of philosophy concerned with how knowledge is made \u2014 but even then he had started to suspect that most of what he was learning was \u201cprobably wrong.\u201d Philosophers talked about science as though it were a purely cognitive enterprise, a matter of sheer intellectual virtuosity, and about scientists (when they talked about them at all) as logical, objective, heroic.In Abidjan, Latour began to wonder what it would look like to study scientific knowledge not as a cognitive process but as an embodied cultural practice enabled by instruments, machinery and specific historical conditions. Would the mind of a scientist or an engineer from, say, California seem any more \u201cmodern\u201d or \u201crational\u201d than that of one from the Ivory Coast if it were studied independent of the education, the laboratory and the tools that shaped it and made its work possible?Before leaving Dijon for Abidjan, Latour met Roger Guillemin, a biologist who would soon go on to win the Nobel Prize for his work on hormone production in the brain. Guillemin later invited him to study his laboratory at the Salk Institute in San Diego, and so beginning in 1975, Latour spent two years there as a sort of participant-observer, following scientists around as they went about their daily work. Part of Latour\u2019s immersion in the lab involved conducting actual experiments, and his co-workers would often gather around to watch. They couldn\u2019t believe that someone could be, as he put it, \u201cso bad and clumsy.\u201d He found pipetting especially difficult. Anytime the slightest thought crossed his mind, he would forget where he placed the instrument and have to start all over again. He later realized that it was precisely his lack of aptitude for lab work that led him to pay such close attention to the intricate, mundane labor involved in the manufacture of objectivity.When he presented his early findings at the first meeting of the newly established Society for Social Studies of Science, in 1976, many of his colleagues were taken aback by a series of black-and-white photographic slides depicting scientists on the job, as though they were chimpanzees. It was felt that scientists were the only ones who could speak with authority on behalf of science; there was something blasphemous about subjecting the discipline, supposedly the apex of modern society, to the kind of cold scrutiny that anthropologists traditionally reserved for \u201cpremodern\u201d peoples. Not everyone felt the same way, however. The previous year, in California, Latour met Steve Woolgar, a British sociologist, who was intrigued by his unorthodox approach. Woolgar turned Latour on to the work of other sociologists and anthropologists, like Michael Lynch, Sharon Traweek and Harold Garfinkel, who had also begun to study science as a social practice. Latour, in turn, invited Woolgar to spend a few weeks with him studying his primates at the Salk Institute.The two men collaborated on \u201cLaboratory Life,\u201d which after its publication in 1979 became a founding text in the nascent field of science and technology studies and, by academic standards, a breakthrough success. The book continues to challenge some of our most deeply held notions about how knowledge is made. No one had ever contested that scientists were human beings, but most people believed that by following the scientific method, scientists were able to arrive at objective facts that transcended their human origins. A decade and a half earlier, in his best seller, \u201cThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions,\u201d the physicist-turned-philosopher Thomas Kuhn had done much to weaken the Whig interpretation of science by showing how historical advances were governed by contingency and debate. What Latour observed firsthand in Guillemin\u2019s lab made the traditional view of science look like little more than a self-serving fiction.In the 1980s, Latour helped to develop and advocate for a new approach to sociological research called Actor-Network Theory. While controversial at the time, it has since been adopted as a methodological tool not just in sociology but also in a range of disciplines, like urban design and public health. From his studies of laboratories, Latour had seen how an apparently weak and isolated item \u2014 a scientific instrument, a scrap of paper, a photograph, a bacterial culture \u2014 could acquire enormous power because of the complicated network of other items, known as actors, that were mobilized around it. The more socially \u201cnetworked\u201d a fact was (the more people and things involved in its production), the more effectively it could refute its less-plausible alternatives. The medical revolution commonly attributed to the genius of Pasteur, he argued, should instead be seen as a result of an association between not just doctors, nurses and hygienists but also worms, milk, sputum, parasites, cows and farms. Science was \u201csocial,\u201d then, not merely because it was performed by people (this, he thought, was a reductive misunderstanding of the word \u201csocial\u201d); rather, science was social because it brought together a multitude of human and nonhuman entities and harnessed their collective power to act on and transform the world.\u201cIt was as though the ice was sending me a message,\u201d Latour recalled in March. Dressed in a striking suit (straw-colored tie, blue waistcoat), he was speaking to a sold-out theater of some 200 people in Strasbourg as part of the city\u2019s biennial puppetry festival. Although Latour is a figure of international renown on the academic circuit, his lecture \u2014 a sort of anti-TED Talk on climate change featuring an array of surreal images and acoustical effects \u2014 was anything but a traditional conference paper. Throughout the performance, Latour\u2019s looming figure was hidden behind images projected onto a screen, so that it seemed as though he were being swallowed by his own PowerPoint presentation. The effect was a bit like watching \u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\u201d if Al Gore had been a coltish French philosopher who said things like \u201cScientists, artists, and social scientists like myself are beginning to propose what we call \u2014 and maybe it\u2019s too exaggerated \u2014 a new cosmology.\u201d\u201cInside\u201d draws heavily on \u201cDown to Earth,\u201d his new book, which has been highly praised in France since its release there last fall. Scientists, he writes, have largely looked at the problem of climate-change denial through the lens of rational empiricism that has governed their profession for centuries; many limit their domain to science, thinking it inappropriate to weigh in on political questions or to speak in an emotional register to communicate urgency. Even though the evidence in support of global warming has long been overwhelming, some scientists continue to believe that the problem of denialism can be solved through ever more data and greater public education. Political scientists, meanwhile, have shown that so-called \u201cirrational\u201d individuals, especially those who are highly educated, in some cases actually hold onto their opinions more strongly when faced with facts that contradict them. Instead of accusing Trump supporters and climate denialists of irrationality, Latour argues that it is untenable to talk about scientific facts as though their rightness alone will be persuasive. In this respect, \u201cDown to Earth\u201d extends the sociological analysis that he brought to bear on factory workers in Abidjan and scientists in California to the minds of anti-scientific voters, looking at the ways in which the reception of seemingly universal knowledge is shaped by the values and local circumstances of those to whom it is being communicated.Some might see this discouraging episode as a reason to back away from a more openly pugnacious approach on the part of scientists. Latour does not. As pleasing as it might be to return to a heroic vision of science, attacks like these \u2014 which exploit our culture\u2019s longstanding division between a politics up for debate and a science \u201cbeyond dispute\u201d \u2014 are not going away. After all, when climatologists speak about the facts in a measured tone, acknowledging their confidence interval, the skeptics claim the mantle of science for themselves, declaring that the facts aren\u2019t yet certain enough and that their own junk science must also be considered. And yet when prominent climate scientists present their facts with passionate conviction, climate skeptics accuse them of political bias. This toxic cycle has further corroded the classical view of science that Latour has long considered indefensible.At a meeting between French industrialists and a climatologist a few years ago, Latour was struck when he heard the scientist defend his results not on the basis of the unimpeachable authority of science but by laying out to his audience his manufacturing secrets: \u201cthe large number of researchers involved in climate analysis, the complex system for verifying data, the articles and reports, the principle of peer evaluation, the vast network of weather stations, floating weather buoys, satellites and computers that ensure the flow of information.\u201d The climate denialists, by contrast, the scientist said, had none of this institutional architecture. Latour realized he was witnessing the beginnings a seismic rhetorical shift: from scientists appealing to transcendent, capital-T Truth to touting the robust networks through which truth is, and has always been, established.Unlike most philosophers, for whom thinking is a sedentary activity, Latour insists on testing our taken-for-granted ideas about the world against the world itself. In effect, he has been running a 50-year experiment, during which he has collected data at the Salk Institute in San Diego, in the Amazon rain forest and in the Kenyan savanna. The current phase of this never-ending research has found him taking on a region commensurate with his global ambition. Latour has recently been traveling the world to observe the scientists who study the effects of climate change on what\u2019s known as the critical zone \u2014 the thin layer of earth that stretches from the lower atmosphere down to the vegetation, soil and bedrock. It is \u201ccritical,\u201d according to geologists, because it is the only place where terrestrial life can flourish. As Latour put it in his lecture in Strasbourg, \u201cEverything we care for, everything we have ever encountered, is here in this tiny critical zone.\u201d Much of his interest in the critical zone stems from his conviction that greater public understanding of it will more accurately show how climate science is made, before its hectic social dimension gets black-boxed.One afternoon during the week before his trip to the Strasbourg puppetry festival, Latour met J\u00e9r\u00f4me Gaillardet, a soft-spoken geochemist, and Alexandra Ar\u00e8nes, a landscape architect whom Latour has described as a latter-day Copernicus, at the Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, one of the country\u2019s top research universities for earth and planetary sciences. Latour had paired his usual aqua Lacoste messenger bag and burgundy slacks with a brown suede jacket, pumpkin scarf and flat tweed cap, which gave him the appearance of a Wes Anderson character. The three of them were gathering to discuss a paper they had written for The Anthropocene Review, a transdisciplinary journal.Latour first met Gaillardet and Ar\u00e8nes through Sciences Po, one of France\u2019s leading universities, where he is an emeritus professor and served as the director of research. Under the guidance of Gaillardet, who directs the network of critical-zone observatories, or C.Z.O.s, in France, Latour has traveled to interview scientists at a handful of the more than 200 sites that informally constitute the international C.Z.O. network. He has become something of a celebrity on the critical-zone circuit, attending meetings at which prospective research is decided, giving talks about this highly heterogeneous region of the earth, publishing papers with environmental scientists (most recently in Science) and encouraging scientists to include humans as a variable in their studies.The authors sat around a circular table in Gaillardet\u2019s office. It was functionally decorated with an equation-strewn whiteboard, pedagogic rocks, geochemistry textbooks and a perpetually spinning desk globe. The idea for the paper emerged after Latour told Gaillardet that the standard representations of the critical zone were \u201ca total disaster.\u201d In contrast to the standard image of the earth, in which the critical zone is represented merely as a thin layer, their paper proposed a new representation in which the critical zone, the most fragile and threatened area of the earth, is the center of attention.They tackled the comments with playful self-deprecation. Ar\u00e8nes realized they had to change the word \u201cconcrete,\u201d which had a more material connotation for geologists than for philosophers. Gaillardet wondered whether a rock could be described as an agent, and pointed out several other flourishes that were \u201cvery rare\u201d in scientific articles, such as the literary epigraph and the fact that a whole sentence was in parentheses. Latour proudly noted that theirs was most likely the only scientific paper ever to have cited Peter Sloterdijk. As they went through and made line edits to the text, Latour saw I was taking notes and turned to me with a wry smile. \u201cDon\u2019t say we are manipulating facts!\u201d he said. \u201cThis is normal science. There is nothing untoward here.\u201dAn hour into the discussion, during a tea break, Gaillardet presented Latour with a thick stack of books on geochemistry, several of which contained equations and problem sets. Latour considered his homework wistfully. The books seemed useful, but he wasn\u2019t sure when he would find the time to give them the attention they deserved. He was especially interested in the monograph by Linus Pauling, whose work he had recently been revisiting. Impressed by Latour\u2019s dedication, Gaillardet remarked that Latour could have been a scientist. The idea seemed almost too much for him to bear.\u201cI could have been a scientist,\u201d Latour said with arch gravity. \u201cI\u2019ve wasted my life.\u201d\u201cTo produce one fact!\u201d Latour sighed, and pointed a finger in the air, as though to demonstrate its indisputable solidity. There was an ache in his eyes. \u201cCan you imagine the pleasure of producing one fact?\u201dNear the top of a winding mountain path, Gaillardet explained to me that some of the questions Latour had been asking the group, in particular about the influence of living organisms on geological processes, were difficult to answer because they forced scientists to reckon with knowledge outside their specialized fields. Part of the trouble with climate change has been that its breadth and complexity defy disciplinary boundaries, making it difficult for specialists to convey the implications of atmospheric patterns from their data alone. What the critical-zone observatories had done, Gaillardet said, was to draw together scientists working in Balkanized disciplines to describe minute environmental changes that more general models of earth-systems science could not detect. But even though human beings were the cause of these changes, earth-systems science had until recently focused on the natural world to the exclusion of the social.With Latour\u2019s appearance on the scene, labs like Gaillardet\u2019s have started to study environmental changes with a thorough recognition that humans and nonhumans, society and nature, are inseparable, bound together in a web of reciprocal influence. This is not simply philosophical conjecture. As Latour has long maintained, critical-zone scientists themselves \u2014 like many environmental researchers \u2014 play a part in the cyclical processes they study: Others use their research to make changes to the very environment they are measuring, in turn challenging the traditional image of scientists as disinterested observers of a passive natural world. \u201cI think what we\u2019ve done with Bruno goes further than simple combination,\u201d Gaillardet told me. \u201cIt changes the way that social science and earth science think.\u201dAs we continued to climb, a view began to emerge of the copse of Germany\u2019s Black Forest dotting the edges of the Rhine Plain. Recent storms had blown several large trees over our path, and at one point, we took a precarious shortcut, clambering over fallen branches while trekking downhill through thick snow.Shortly after noon, we reached the summit of the mountain, where we discovered a low concrete bunker. Inside was the observatory\u2019s gravimeter. A blue cylindrical machine, it measures differences in the mass of the water collected in a catchment farther down the mountain by tracking infinitesimal changes in gravitational force. The old Dell computer to which it was attached was taking a while to turn on. As we waited, Jacques Hinderer, an amiable geophysicist, explained some of the difficulties in obtaining precise data. Gaillardet kept his eye on Latour, who wore an expression of beatific delight, to make sure he was understanding the technical details.When the computer finally came to life, its screen displayed a simple animation \u2014 green waves of varying thickness undulating against a blue background. Strictly speaking, they represented the gravitational effects of the ocean waves and the tide. But these tremors also reminded me of Latour\u2019s description of the earth in the Anthropocene as \u201can active, local, limited, sensitive, fragile, trembling and easily irritated envelope.\u201d He stood before the small monitor, rapt. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful that ocean waves can actually be heard in the middle of the Vosges,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole earth is made sensitive here. It\u2019s very moving.\u201dHad they been among our circus that day, Latour\u2019s critics might have felt that there was something odd about the scene \u2014 the old adversary of science worshipers kneeling before the altar of science. But what they would have missed \u2014 what they have always missed \u2014 was that Latour never sought to deny the existence of gravity. He has been doing something much more unusual: trying to redescribe the conditions by which this knowledge comes to be known.Crowded into the little concrete room, we were seeing gravity as Latour had always seen it \u2014 not as the thing in itself, nor as a mental representation, but as scientific technology allowed us to see it. This, in Latour\u2019s view, was the only way it could be seen. Gravity, he has argued time and again, was created and made visible by the labor and expertise of scientists, the government funding that paid for their education, the electricity that powered up the sluggish computer, the truck that transported the gravimeter to the mountaintop, the geophysicists who translated its readings into calculations and legible diagrams, and so on. Without this network, the invisible waves would remain lost to our senses. For a few moments, Latour stood reverently before the rolling waves on the screen. Then he said to the assembled scientists, as though he were admiring a newborn child, \u201cBeautiful \u2014 you must be really proud.\u201dAva Kofman is a contributing writer for The Intercept.

{"Headline": "Tech Workers Now Want to Know: What Are We Building This For?", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile Dr. Poulson works on search technologies, he had no knowledge of the product, which was code-named Dragonfly. So in a meeting last month with Jeff Dean, the company\u2019s head of artificial intelligence, Dr. Poulson asked if Google planned to move ahead with the product and if his work would contribute to censorship and surveillance in China.According to Dr. Poulson, Mr. Dean said that Google complied with surveillance requests from the federal government and asked rhetorically if the company should leave the United States market in protest. Mr. Dean also shared a draft of a company email that read, \u201cWe won\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t provide 100 percent transparency to every Googler, to respect our commitments to customer confidentiality and giving our product teams the freedom to innovate.\u201dThe next day, Dr. Poulson quit the company. Mr. Dean did not respond to a request for comment, and Google declined to comment.Across the technology industry, rank-and-file employees are demanding greater insight into how their companies are deploying the technology that they built. At Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce, as well as at tech start-ups, engineers and technologists are increasingly asking whether the products they are working on are being used for surveillance in places like China or for military projects in the United States or elsewhere.That\u2019s a change from the past, when Silicon Valley workers typically developed products with little questioning about the social costs. It is also a sign of how some tech companies, which grew by serving consumers and businesses, are expanding more into government work. And the shift coincides with concerns in Silicon Valley about the Trump administration\u2019s policies and the larger role of technology in government.And the change is likely to last: Some engineering students have said they are demanding more answers and are asking similar questions, even before they move into the work force.\u201cWhat people are looking for \u2014 not just employees \u2014 they are looking for some clarity,\u201d said Frank Shaw, a Microsoft spokesman. \u201cAre there principles that get applied? Even if you don\u2019t agree with the decision that gets made, if you understand the thinking behind it, it helps a lot.\u201dAmazon did not respond to a request for comment.The lack of information about what tech employees are working on was recently evident at Clarifai, an artificial intelligence start-up in New York City.Last year, a small team of Clarifai engineers began working on a project inside a private room at its downtown New York office, said three people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified for fear of retaliation. Paper covered the windows, and employees called the room \u201cThe Chamber of Secrets,\u201d in a sly reference to the second Harry Potter novel. Even the eight engineers and researchers working inside the room did not entirely realize the nature of the project, the people said.When employees asked about the project in meetings, Clarifai\u2019s chief executive, Matt Zeiler, said it was a government project related to \u201canalytics\u201d or \u201csurveillance\u201d and would \u201csave lives,\u201d according to the people.After employees read documents posted to Clarifai\u2019s internal systems, it became clear that the company had won a contract for Project Maven and that workers were creating something for the Defense Department, the people said. One engineer quit the project immediately after a meeting with the Defense Department where killing was discussed in frank terms, they said.A Clarifai spokesman said that at the very beginning of the project, the company sat down with those chosen for it to brief them on the nature of the work, and one employee quit the project then. \u201cEvery member of Clarifai\u2019s Project Maven team agreed to work on the project, and the two people who chose not to participate were assigned to different efforts across the company,\u201d the spokesman said.Dr. Poulson, whose work involved incorporating a variety of languages into Google search, said he did not initially think his research could be involved in Dragonfly \u2014 until he noticed Chinese had been added to a list of languages for his project.\u201cMost people don\u2019t know the holistic scope of what they\u2019re building,\u201d said Dr. Poulson, 32, who worked at Google for over two years. \u201cYou don\u2019t have knowledge of where it\u2019s going unless you\u2019re sufficiently senior.\u201dThe difficulties of knowing what companies are doing with technologies is compounded because engineers at large tech companies often build infrastructure \u2014 like algorithms, databases and even hardware \u2014 that underpins almost every product a company offers. At Google, for example, a storage system called Colossus is used by Google search, Google Maps and Gmail.\u201cIt would be very difficult for most engineers in Google to be sure that their work wouldn\u2019t contribute to these projects in some way,\u201d said Ms. Nolan, who helped to keep Google\u2019s systems running online smoothly. \u201cMy personal feeling was that if the organization is doing something I find ethically unacceptable, then I was contributing to it.\u201dYet executives at tech companies have claimed that complete transparency is not possible.\u201cWe\u2019ve always had confidential projects as a company. I think what happened when the company was smaller, you had a higher chance of knowing about it,\u201d Sundar Pichai, Google\u2019s chief executive, said at a staff meeting in August, according to a transcript provided to The New York Times. \u201cI think there are a lot of times when people are in exploratory stages where teams are debating and doing things, so sometimes being fully transparent at that stage can cause issues.\u201d\u201cWe are students opposed to the weaponization of technology by companies like Google and Microsoft,\u201d the pledge stated. \u201cOur dream is to be a positive force in the world. We refuse to be complicit in this gross misuse of power.\u201dAlex Ahmed, a doctoral candidate in computer science at Northeastern University in Boston, said she organized a student discussion on campus this month to debate whether they should work for tech companies that made decisions they believed to be unethical.\u201cWe\u2019re not given an ethics course. We\u2019re not given a political education,\u201d Ms. Ahmed, 29, said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for us to do this unless we create the conversations for ourselves.\u201dOver the summer, she said, students at Northeastern also protested the school\u2019s multimillion-dollar research contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, under which it would provide research on technology exports to the agency. A Northeastern spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Bridget Frey, the chief technology officer at the online real estate company Redfin, said job candidates had increasingly raised ethical questions in interviews. This summer, interns questioned Redfin\u2019s chief executive, Glenn Kelman, about whether the way the site displays school information and test scores could contribute to socio-economic divides in neighborhoods. In response, the company said it planned to add more context about the test score information early next year.Employees are now frequently asking, \u201cIf you don\u2019t share the information with me, how can I make sure this isn\u2019t happening here?\u201d Ms. Frey said.An earlier version of this article misstated the timing of the real estate company Redfin\u2019s addition of context to school test score information it publishes online. It plans to add that context early next year; it has not already added it.Advertisement"}

In recent years, the tech industry\u2019s largest powers set their sights on a new target for digital conquest. They promised wild conveniences and unimaginable benefits to our health and happiness. There\u2019s just one catch, which often goes unstated: If their novelties take off without any intervention or supervision from the government, we could be inviting a nightmarish set of security and privacy vulnerabilities into the world. And guess what. No one is really doing much to stop it.The industry\u2019s new goal? Not a computer on every desk nor a connection between every person, but something grander: a computer inside everything, connecting everyone.Cars, door locks, contact lenses, clothes, toasters, refrigerators, industrial robots, fish tanks, sex toys, light bulbs, toothbrushes, motorcycle helmets \u2014 these and other everyday objects are all on the menu for getting \u201csmart.\u201d Hundreds of small start-ups are taking part in this trend \u2014 known by the marketing catchphrase \u201cthe internet of things\u201d \u2014 but like everything else in tech, the movement is led by giants, among them Amazon, Apple and Samsung.Mr. Schneier says only government intervention can save us from such emerging calamities. He calls for reimagining the regulatory regime surrounding digital security in the same way the federal government altered its national security apparatus after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Among other ideas, he outlines the need for a new federal agency, the National Cyber Office, which he imagines researching, advising and coordinating a response to threats posed by an everything-internet.\u201cI can think of no industry in the past 100 years that has improved its safety and security without being compelled to do so by government,\u201d he wrote. But he conceded that government intervention seems unlikely at best. \u201cIn our government-can\u2019t-do-anything-ever society, I don\u2019t see any reining in of the corporate trends,\u201d he said.At a press event last month, an Amazon engineer showed how easily a maker of household fans could create a \u201csmart\u201d fan using Amazon\u2019s chip, known as the Alexa Connect Kit. The kit, which Amazon is testing with some manufacturers, would simply be plugged into the fan\u2019s control unit during assembly. The manufacturer also has to write a few lines of code \u2014 in the example of the fan, the Amazon engineer needed just a half-page of code.And that\u2019s it. The fan\u2019s digital bits (including security and cloud storage) are all handled by Amazon. If you buy it from Amazon, the fan will automatically connect with your home network and start obeying commands issued to your Alexa. Just plug it in.This system illustrates Mr. Schneier\u2019s larger argument, which is that the cost of adding computers to objects will get so small that it will make sense for manufacturers to connect every type of device to the internet.Even if the benefits are tiny, they create a certain market logic; at some point not long from now, devices that don\u2019t connect to the internet will be rarer than ones that do.The trouble, though, is that business models for these devices don\u2019t often allow for the kind of continuing security maintenance that we are used to with more traditional computing devices. Apple has an incentive to keep writing security updates to keep your iPhone secure; it does so because iPhones sell for a lot of money, and Apple\u2019s brand depends on keeping you safe from digital terrors.The Internet of Things Consortium, an industry group that represents dozens of companies, did not respond to an inquiry.Mr. Schneier is painting government intervention not as a panacea but as a speed bump, a way for us humans to catch up to the technological advances. Regulation and government oversight slow down innovation \u2014 that\u2019s one reason techies don\u2019t like it.

{"Headline": "Bruce Nauman, the Artist\u2019s Artist", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "In the past half-century, he has created masterpieces in nearly every medium and, in the process, pushed the limits of what art can \u2014 and should \u2014 do.Supported byTHOUGH THE ARTIST Bruce Nauman\u2019s home and studio are just outside of Santa Fe, N.M. \u2014 a few miles from grapefruit margaritas, enchiladas with red-and-green chile sauce (\u201cChristmas style\u201d), stores selling miniature adobe huts, innumerable yoga studios, innumerable galleries of local artists \u2014 the distance feels greater. To enter into Nauman\u2019s world is to leave much of what one feels to be familiar, to suddenly feel all of it is trivial and inessential and to regret that at some point one has to return to it. His house is so unassuming as to be indescribable, his studio not much more than a giant shed. There is a field for a few tranquil horses, a shelter full of bales of hay. It was a dry year, he said in his clipped, hoarse, somewhat unlocatable Western accent, and water-stressed rattlesnakes stayed close to home. Just the other day, he found one on the steps to the studio.Nauman is tall and physically imposing, but the destabilizing effect of meeting one of the most influential American artists was mitigated by his short-sleeved-Hawaiian-shirt-and-dad-jeans mien. He is also \u2014 simply and unembarrassedly \u2014 aging, his body no longer capable of its previous feats. In his early videos from the 1960s, he displayed his lithe figure and startlingly handsome face to tremendous effect. A 16-millimeter masterwork from 1968, \u201cWalking in an Exaggerated Manner Around the Perimeter of a Square,\u201d shows the artist in a white T-shirt and dark pants toeing the line of a square in an empty studio, stopping to strike an exaggerated Renaissance-style contrapposto.18 PhotosIn the span of two decades, Nauman came to embody a larger transition in the art world, and perhaps beyond the art world. He had created seminal works on video in the studio of Lichtenstein, a Pop artist, which pointed in a direction away from Minimalism and toward some combination of process, dance and performance. And there was the suggestion, in his self-aware language-based works, of what would come to be called postmodernism. The artist did not reveal mystic truths \u2014 he simply revealed what it was to make art. Nauman played a critical part in laying out the possible pathways that art could follow. Then, in 1979, he disappeared.REFLECTING ON HIS move to the desert in New Mexico, Nauman admitted to having been nervous. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how you develop as an artist outside of a major cultural center,\u201d he said, suggesting that you needed that \u201cexposure and intensity around you at least some time in your life.\u201d But he felt he had developed the habits and ideas that would carry him in relative isolation \u2014 and that he had been on the hunt for that sort of privacy for some time. He had left the Bay Area because of what he felt was, as he once put it, an \u201cincredible paranoia among most of the people I knew\u201d that reflected a distrust of intellectualism and measures of artistic success, as well as a generalized hatred of New York and Los Angeles, the country\u2019s main art centers. \u201cIn New York there\u2019s a season for art and in California it just doesn\u2019t happen that way,\u201d he told Interview magazine in 1973. \u201cSince there is so little gallery business going on, and the weather doesn\u2019t change that much, it doesn\u2019t have that cycle quality.\u201d Nauman has never lived in New York, traveling to the city only occasionally during the one winter in 1968 that he occupied Lichtenstein\u2019s Southampton studio, and he lived only on the fringes of Los Angeles when he moved to Pasadena in the spring of 1969. In moving to New Mexico, he also missed, perhaps providentially, the ballooning of the commercial art world. By the late 1970s, Larry Gagosian had opened his first gallery and Julian Schnabel had sold out his first show of \u201cbroken plate\u201d paintings: two events that signaled the crudeness, volatility and sheer commercial swagger that would overtake the art world in the years to come. Nauman\u2019s work from this time stood apart from that world, even as he became recognized for his influence and enduring vision. Pursuing his own path, far from everyone else, he became at once emblematic and singular.There was always something darkly funny about Nauman\u2019s work \u2014 the neon signs that look inviting enough to hang over a mom-and-pop store, if only they didn\u2019t depict an unmentionable sexual position \u2014 but his humor, like Beckett\u2019s, was filled with abyssal dread. As he moved further and further away from the trappings of the art world and its society, Nauman\u2019s work shifted. His daughter (from his marriage to his first wife, with whom he also has a son) went to school in the area, and he got to know cowboys: people who, like artists, did a number of different things, in addition to breaking and riding horses. In other words: Art was just another way of life, and consisted of so many different kinds of activity, in a way that both inflated and deflated its importance. Rather than ignore this conflict, Nauman explored it, and his work subsequently, perhaps inevitably, became darker, more combative. In 1994, his second major retrospective traveled from the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles to the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C., where the philosopher Arthur Danto, the art critic for The Nation, reviewed it, professing to be utterly confused by the \u201cnoisy, awful exhibition,\u201d which he thought was apparently the work of a \u201csmartass perpetrator of aesthetic practical jokes\u201d rather than the \u201chumanist\u201d that Danto had previously \u201cbelieved him to be.\u201d It was, he said, \u201caggressive and nasty, cacophonous and arrogant, silly and portentous.\u201d One of the works that Danto and a number of other critics (and no doubt many viewers) struggled with was \u201cClown Torture\u201d (1987), Nauman\u2019s most terrifying video, previously shown at the 1989 Whitney Biennial. An installation of four monitors and two screen projections, it showed a figure in a clown costume \u2014 in a departure, it was the actor Walter Stevens, not Nauman himself \u2014 engaged in acts of self-abasement or abject protest. In one, the clown was watched from above, on the toilet; in another, he kicked at the screen with his outsize shoes, screaming, \u201cNo, no, no, no, no!\u201d In another, he told an endless joke: \u201cPete and Repeat are sitting on a fence. Pete falls off. Who\u2019s left? Repeat ...\u201d Here again was the old absurdity, but multiplied \u2014 the overall effect a sense of horror, and complicity in the misery of this strange, faceless, unknown and unknowable figure.Whether it was the nightmarishness of the show or simply the cumulative weight of all the years of work, the retrospective sapped Nauman, and he had difficulty returning to work. He told me that retrospectives were \u201cno fun.\u201d \u201cSometimes I can\u2019t make any connection with why I did something or how,\u201d he said, when talking about the work that will be shown in the MoMA retrospective this month. Still, he was pleased that so far \u201cthere was nothing that I hated.\u201d Revisiting another work from this period included in the show, the video installation \u201cShadow Puppets and Instructed Mime\u201d (1990), in which a voice-over offers degrading instructions to a meek mime, he said, \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen that for years, and it was pretty scary. I didn\u2019t remember it as being scary, but it was.\u201d At the same time, the long silence following the 1990s retrospective signaled another breakthrough. There were signs of it even earlier, like in \u201cClown Torture\u201d: the fact that he had given up some modicum of control, allowing another person to do the work that he might have done. \u201cOne thing that was very hard for me was by allowing people to participate in the work in a very active way,\u201d he said, \u201cI was giving up a lot of control. So that was kind of scary and important.\u201dThat Nauman can find himself letting go in his old age seems like a sharp departure from his previous work. Even if he has returned to focus on his body, what is apparent in his later work is the way his body no longer functions as it once did; age, something that no one can truly fight off, has taken its toll. But there was always an aspect of freedom-seeking in what he did, in setting himself within certain confines and trying to find out what, precisely, he was capable of. He seemed to be looking for a medium, a way of working that would fit with a feeling of being overtaken, of losing control. His more recent work, as with his earlier output, goes deep into the private self, somehow bringing you closer to the world, to the society that you otherwise could not see. As it happens, it isn\u2019t just his body that is giving way \u2014 the desert he sought out nearly 40 years ago has begun to change as well. The red, dusty landscape that surrounds his house and studio is rived by a dry creek bed. When Nauman first arrived to this property in 1989, the creek was reliably full. \u201cNow it\u2019s dry,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept when there are big storms.\u201d But there are fewer big storms, and the water level has dropped seven feet.Photographer\u2019s assistant: Galen Fletcher Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Ads From Unknown Backer Take Aim at Brexit Plan", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Prime Minister Theresa May has struggled to build support for her plan for Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union. Now, it turns out, some of the opposition has come from an unknown organization posting ads to millions of people on Facebook.In the past 10 months, the organization spent more than 250,000 pounds on ads pushing for a more severe break from the European Union than Mrs. May has planned. The ads reached 10 million to 11 million people, according to a report published on Saturday by a House of Commons committee investigating the manipulation of social media in elections.The ads, which disappeared suddenly this week, linked to websites for people to send prewritten emails to their local member of Parliament outlining their opposition to Mrs. May\u2019s negotiations with the European Union.\u201cWe voted to leave the E.U., to take back control of our money and borders,\u201d one ad said.Who was behind the campaign remains a mystery. The name attached to it was Mainstream Network, a group that does not appear to exist in Britain, beyond the ads and a website. There is no information on Facebook or on Mainstream Network\u2019s site about who is behind the organization.The parliamentary panel, the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said the posts highlighted Facebook\u2019s continuing problem monitoring political advertising on its social network.\u201cHere we have an example of a clearly sophisticated organization spending lots of money on a political campaign, and we have absolutely no idea who is behind it,\u201d Damian Collins, the chairman of committee, said in a statement. \u201cThe only people who know who is paying for these adverts is Facebook.\u201dThe panel has been investigating the role of social media in elections, including Facebook\u2019s influence on the country\u2019s contentious 2016 vote to leave the European Union. It is expected to release a full report in the coming weeks.Rob Leathern, director of product management at Facebook, said the company will update its disclosure policy in Britain next month. It will require political advertisers to verify their identities and then attach accurate information about their identities to the ads.\u201cWe know we can\u2019t prevent election interference alone,\u201d Mr. Leathern said, \u201cand offering more ad transparency allows journalists, researchers and other interested parties to raise important questions.\u201dTo oversee its response to a growing number of regulatory challenges around the world, the company announced on Friday that Nick Clegg, a former deputy prime minister in Britain who is politically well connected in Europe, would become its new head of global public policy.The Mainstream Network ads were taken down after Facebook announced its new political advertising rules in Britain, said Mike Harris, the chief executive of 89up, a social media marketing company that the parliamentary committee hired to help with its investigation.Mr. Harris, who specializes in political campaigns, discovered the ads recently when one popped up in his social media feed. His company, which has also done work for groups in favor of remaining in the European Union, found more than 70 ads posted over a 10-month period.The group behind the ads appears to be well funded. Based on what comparable political Facebook ad campaigns cost in the country, 89up estimated Mainstream Network spent \u00a3257,000, or about $335,000. Mainstream Network also maintains a polished website that mixes commentary favoring a hard break from the European Union, alongside straighter coverage of events such as Amazon\u2019s announcement that it will add jobs in Britain.Mainstream Network doesn\u2019t give any clue of who is publishing the content. No contact information is listed on its website or Facebook page.\u201cThere is no indication of who\u2019s behind it, or who\u2019s backing it,\u201d Mr. Harris said in an interview. \u201cThis could be a wealthy individual, this could be a group of volunteers that has come together that decided to hide its identity, or it could be a foreign state. It\u2019s totally unclear.\u201dThe ads were disclosed at a politically fragile time in Britain, where Mrs. May is trying to balance the position of those who want to retain closer ties to the Continent against those who want a harder break.Mainstream Network\u2019s ads have strongly targeted Mrs. May\u2019s central negotiating position, known as the \u201cChequers plan,\u201d which would maintain a tight trading relationship with Europe. Two members of her cabinet resigned over her approach.Pro-Brexit hard-liners want her to scrap the plan and propose a more distant relationship, like the European Union\u2019s trade agreement with Canada.The disclosures released on Saturday are a prelude to other investigations into online misinformation scheduled to be released by the end of the year. In addition to the parliamentary committee\u2019s final report, highly anticipated findings are expected from the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office after its investigation of Cambridge Analytica, the London-based political targeting firm that harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users.Stephen Castle contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

In a post on Wednesday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive, appeared to dismiss the concerns when he wrote to employees that \u201cit is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.\u201d Facebook plans to hold another staff meeting on Friday to contain the damage, said the current and former employees.After the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the country, the E.U. \u2014 still in the pact \u2014 began trying to shield its companies from the financial penalties. There\u2019s more at stake than one agreement.What the Europeans devised is a \u201cspecial payments entity\u201d to let companies move money in and out of Tehran when Western banks won\u2019t. While big multinationals have already withdrawn from Iran, others haven\u2019t \u2014 and Europeans hope that continued trade will keep the nuclear deal alive. (American officials threatened to crack down on any such move.)The danger for the United States is that the payments mechanism gives the European Union valuable experience operating outside Washington\u2019s financial sphere of influence and becomes a permanent part of the international payments system.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

He added, with awe, \u201cThe guest list is incredible. There are binders filled with pages like this.\u201dHe had incorporated similar historical tidbits into his previous books, like \u201c716 North Palm Drive,\u201d which reprinted a 1934 issue of Motion Picture magazine with interior photos of the house in Beverly Hills, then owned by the actress Adrienne Ames.Mr. Silverman has carved out a novel role as the James Boswell of architecture in Beverly Hills and other exclusive Los Angeles enclaves. His vanity books tell of the Tudor revivals and Spanish colonials that played host to Golden Age movie stars and moguls, house histories written for a limited readership of the famous and wealthy who currently own them. The books are not sold on Amazon or at bookstores, but rather meticulously crafted as bespoke tomes for clients seeking to learn more about the rarefied worlds they inhabit.\u201cThis is so rewarding and fulfills so many of my interests that I felt I couldn\u2019t pass it up,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone in the country does books like this, certainly not in Los Angeles.\u201dThat first book created the template: Each chapter focuses on a previous homeowner, in chronological order, and is padded with archival photos, old newspaper and magazine clippings and anecdotes, culled from online databases like archive.org, libraries, books, vintage issues of Architectural Digest, public records and firsthand sources like relatives.To learn more about the Selznick estate, Mr. Silverman contacted Daniel Selznick, David O. Selznick\u2019s last surviving child, now 82 and living in the Motion Picture & TV Relief Fund Home in Woodland Hills, Calif. \u201cI picked him up and drove him over there, and as we\u2019re driving, he\u2019s pointing to all these houses: \u2018This person used to live there. Charlie Chaplin lived across the street from them.\u2019 You always hear about these actors and executives, and they\u2019re mythic characters. It becomes real.\u201dThe more history that\u2019s attached to a house, the more famous its owners and houseguests, generally the more involved the project. Mr. Silverman\u2019s magnum opus is \u201cA History of 209 Rockingham Avenue,\u201d which he subtitled \u201cThe House That Shirley Built,\u201d referring to Shirley Temple\u2019s one-time Brentwood home.Mr. Silverman himself tracked down a 1927 aerial photo of Brentwood, interviewed Ms. Temple\u2019s first stand-in and invited her and others to a Shirley-themed house party he organized to celebrate the child star\u2019s life. He can\u2019t resist going down such rabbit holes; indeed, it\u2019s become his calling card.\u201cHe\u2019s an excellent researcher, and I think he gets great pleasure out of it,\u201d said Joyce Rey, a veteran Beverly Hills real estate agent who has hired him.\u201cI had always heard that Liz Taylor had lived there,\u201d Ms. Rey said. \u201cBut David authenticates and enhances the information.\u201dAs for his own home, Mr. Silverman lives with his dog in Brentwood, in a 1950s ranch whose undistinguished history, he said, wouldn\u2019t make for an interesting book. More fertile territory is in the so-called Platinum Triangle, the wealthy enclaves of Bel Air, Holmby Hills and Beverly Hills, whose large homes, with their celebrity residents over many decades, suggest stories on every palm-tree-lined block.Mr. Silverman left his sister\u2019s house and took a reporter for a spin around the area. The Selznick estate that Mr. Taschen was restoring was a five-minute drive through windy, lushly manicured streets.He pointed out the second-floor master bedroom, where, he\u2019d learned, on stuffy nights David O. Selznick pushed a button from his bed to open electric windows. A floor below was the projection room, where movies were screened on Sunday nights.Mr. Silverman spoke once again of touring the home with Danny Selznick, who\u2019d grown up there \u2014 a memorable experience for the archivist. \u201cDanny would say, \u2018This is where Cary Grant sat. Dad had his Oscars on this shelf.\u2019 It was just bringing the house to life.\u201dIn his own way, Mr. Silverman hoped to create the same effect.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Yes, in Your Backyard", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ & AAre accessory dwelling units the answer to the housing shortage? The designer Yves B\u00e9har thinks so, and he has a new prototype to prove it. It\u2019s basically an extra building you can build in your backyard. This is now being recognized as a solution for adding housing, whether it\u2019s for aging parents, students or people who are just starting out. It\u2019s a solution for housing stock in cities, and hopefully bringing costs down. And people can do it themselves rather than waiting for local government or developers.It\u2019s been a very fascinating field that has had its ups and downs. The traction prefabs were having was much lower than anticipated for single-family homes. What\u2019s really transformational for the field, I believe, are these new A.D.U. laws. Interest has really boomed. I\u2019m anticipating that the A.D.U. market will grow substantially in the next decade or two.The reason prefabs make so much sense in the A.D.U. context is that the added construction is easy on neighborhoods and neighbors. It can take two, three years to build something, with all the noise and visual pollution. And wasted materials that come with that. But with the YB1, it takes about a month to build it in a factory and a day to install. It comes prewired with all your electrical, HVAC, appliances \u2014 everything is ready to go. Prefabs make it so much more accessible for people to add housing stock, and it\u2019s so much cleaner.Designing a prefab to fit in someone\u2019s backyard is a different exercise than thinking about completely new construction on a virgin piece of land. It\u2019s a smaller space, and it has neighbors, fences and privacy and light issues. I realized that a one-size-fits-all approach wouldn\u2019t function well, and would really restrict adoption.Our approach has been to think of it more as a system that allows maximum flexibility. It\u2019s built on a four-foot system: Every four feet, you can decide whether you have a full-height wall, a full-height window, a clerestory or a half-size window. You can decide how much light you have, and where the view comes from. You can maximize privacy and the program of the home to be really specific to your needs. There are two different flat-roof heights \u2014 one with clerestory, one without \u2014 and a pitched roof, which gives you the option to have a loft space upstairs. It can be modulated in ways that prefab traditionally hasn\u2019t allowed.It\u2019s a steel structure with concrete panels or slatted wood panels in a natural or black finish. There\u2019s a shutter system that creates shadow with an overhead awning. We have a roof that is designed to capture rainwater and connect to rain barrels. We have super-efficient mini-split heating and cooling. The house is designed to be solar ready. Essentially, all this means that it could be off-grid.They\u2019ll work across very different climates. We\u2019re working on a project right now in Tahoe, a pitched-roof version of the A.D.U. for a colder climate, in a snow area. We do have that in California.I like helical piles, but you can also put it on a standard foundation. Just the amount of disruption to the land \u2014 and the amount of noisy or dirty work that has to happen \u2014 is less with piles than it is with a concrete foundation.This one has a lot of glass, almost all the way around, and is a full-featured one with really nice appliances and finishes. So it\u2019s toward the higher end of what we build.Plant Prefab is investing in robotic construction and new assembly technology, which will help us to bring the cost down. We think of it a little like a Tesla Model S versus a Tesla Model 3, with a progression of products that will be priced differently.We\u2019re working on it right now and actually have a project for low-cost housing here in Northern California, where they\u2019re interested in a nice little number of them. Based on that particular project, I think we\u2019ll have an opportunity in the next year or so.Advertisement"}

He is among a gaggle of West Coast technology moguls who are riding to the rescue of the beleaguered East Coast media.On Wednesday, New York Public Radio announced a $2.5 million gift from Mr. Newmark to expand its newsroom. That brings his total philanthropic efforts involving media in the last year to $50 million, much of it centered on New York.\u201cA trustworthy press is the immune system of democracy,\u201d Mr. Newmark said. \u201cLike we say in Jersey\u201d \u2014 he hails from Morristown, N.J. \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019ve got to put your money where your mouth is.\u201dThat mouth is something that is often on Mr. Newmark\u2019s mind these days. As he moves onto a national media stage, he is trying out personas, hoping for the right blend of sincerity and humor.\u201cI\u2019m not as articulate as I need to be,\u201d he said. \u201cI might not be the nerd people really need, but I\u2019m the nerd they\u2019ve got.\u201dPause. \u201cIs that quotable? I kind of like that,\u201d he said.\u201cI\u2019m not the kind of guy to own an operation,\u201d Mr. Newmark said. \u201cI help, then I get out of the way, then I stay out of the way. That\u2019s my strength.\u201dHe disagrees that he helped kill newspapers. In the back garden of the Reverie Cafe, near San Francisco\u2019s Haight-Ashbury neighborhood and not far from his house, he said he was getting a bum rap.\u201cPeople throw the accusation,\u201d he said. \u201cI look at the facts and stick with that. Ever watch \u2018CSI\u2019 shows? They say follow the evidence.\u201dHe cited the work of the media analyst Thomas Baekdal as proof that newspapers\u2019 decline long preceded Craigslist. In an email, Mr. Baekdal largely absolved Craigslist of any responsibility for devastating newspapers and hastening the end of the world.\u201cIf we were to imagine a world where Craigslist was never invented, I do not think it would have made any difference,\u201d Mr. Baekdal wrote. \u201cWe in the media industry insisted on keeping the classified market limited and high-priced so that it supported other parts of our businesses where we were essentially losing money (a.k.a. journalism). It was only a matter of time before someone realized there was a more efficient way to do this.\u201dThe fact that Craigslist was free, however, doubtless accelerated its effect. It is now in 700 cities in 70 countries.\u201cCraigslist helped people put food on the table, helped people get a table, helped people get a roof under which to put the table,\u201d Mr. Newmark said. It is something he has said before, he acknowledged, \u201cmost recently some hours ago, on Twitter.\u201dSo how is the yoga going?\u201cLet\u2019s say that\u2019s still in the future,\u201d he said.Mr. Newmark still does customer service for Craigslist, which mostly consists of booting off troublemakers, but has not had an operational role for a long time. \u201cAs a manager,\u201d he noted, \u201cI suck.\u201dUnlike just about every other venture begun in the dot-com era, Craigslist never even thought about going public. It has no ads or subscription fees. (It charges for job postings in the United States and for brokered apartment listings in New York.)Every tech mogul ever born has maintained that it is not about the money, but for Mr. Newmark and Mr. Buckmaster this really seems to be true. In 2006, Mr. Buckmaster told an audience in New York that there were problems with \u201cobscene wealth.\u201d\u201cYou should be careful what you wish for. Do you really want to walk around with bodyguards?\u201d he asked. The audience shouted back, \u201cYes, yes!\u201d and \u201cI do!\u201dMr. Newmark flies commercial. At Cafe Reverie, his consumption was limited to a glass of water. His biggest extravagance is a $6 million New York City apartment.One thing is clear: He is not spending his money on Craigslist. He can\u2019t remember the last time he got something off the site, although he said his wife used it.\u201cCraig doesn\u2019t need to prove he\u2019s someone by having possessions,\u201d said Sylvia Paull, a media consultant who has known Mr. Newmark for 20 years. \u201cHis way of living mirrors Craigslist. For years people have been saying, \u2018You\u2019ve got to upgrade the interface, make it more interactive, add color.\u2019 He just says, \u2018No, I like it simple and plain.\u2019\u201dMr. Newmark has been a steadfast supporter of women in tech, and built a website for Ms. Paull\u2019s networking group for women, Gracenet, back when that was a labor-intensive initiative. He also funds veterans\u2019 causes. He has lingering guilt about not serving in Vietnam even though he knows he wouldn\u2019t have been much of a soldier.Contributing money isn\u2019t enough. He shows up at symposiums, like a recent one in Berkeley, Calif. He told the audience that he traced the crisis in journalism back to the mid-1990s, when the speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, offered \u201cattractive lies the press just couldn\u2019t stay away from.\u201d He criticized The New York Times for its coverage of the 2016 presidential race and offered general advice: \u201cDon\u2019t be a loudspeaker for liars.\u201d\u201cI\u2019d love to see some of the S.F.-based tech moguls step up and help journalism in their own backyard,\u201d said Gary Kamiya, a former editor of the magazine.But Mr. Newmark is concentrating on New York, where local coverage has also faltered.\u201cMy goal is to support the groups which are not only going to do good work but say, \u2018Here\u2019s how you do good work,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like things to start in New York and spread.\u201dAs he was leaving Cafe Reverie, Mr. Newmark checked his phone.\u201cTwenty-seven new emails,\u201d he said.How many were asking for money?\u201cAll of them,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

But that expenditure actually fell as a percentage of the overall (and rapidly growing) economy.Corporate tax revenues have fallen by a third from a comparable period a year ago, a direct consequence of the tax law signed last year, which reduced the top corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.For the full 2018 fiscal year, corporate tax receipts were nearly $205 billion. That figure is a drop from $297 billion in fiscal year 2017.And because the tax law change didn\u2019t take effect until January, its full effect won\u2019t be known until the 2019 fiscal year.At a conference yesterday celebrating Wired magazine\u2019s 25th anniversary, two of the biggest names in tech addressed some of their divisive business strategies:More from Paul Mozur of the NYT:The military exploited Facebook\u2019s wide reach in Myanmar, where it is so broadly used that many of the country\u2019s 18 million internet users confuse the Silicon Valley social media platform with the internet. Human rights groups blame the anti-Rohingya propaganda for inciting murders, rapes and the largest forced human migration in recent history.Facebook has since removed accounts with a total of 1.3 million followers that supposedly focused on entertainment, but that instead appeared tied to the military.This is the latest in a series of disinformation campaigns \u2014 including from Russia and Iran \u2014 to plague Facebook. But as Mr. Mozur points out, it is \u201camong the first examples of an authoritarian government\u2019s using the social network against its own people.\u201dThe Microsoft co-founder, who helped popularize personal computing with Bill Gates and later used his wealth to transform Seattle, died yesterday. The cause was complications of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, which returned years after he had been treated for it.Mr. Allen was instrumental in putting together a deal to buy an early operating system from a programmer in Seattle. He and Mr. Gates tweaked and massaged the code, and it became the operating system that guided the IBM personal computer, introduced in 1981. That product, called Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS, was a watershed for the company. Later would come Microsoft\u2019s immensely popular Windows operating system, designed to be used with a computer mouse and onscreen icons.In a statement, Mr. Gates said that he was \u201cheartbroken by the passing of one of my oldest and dearest friends,\u201d adding that \u201cpersonal computing would not have existed without him.\u201dMr. Icahn said in a letter yesterday that he owns 8.3 percent of a special Dell stock that tracks the company\u2019s holdings in the publicly traded company VMware.

If there are sanctions over the alleged murder of Mr. Khashoggi, the Saudis want the world to know, they will fight back.These are empty threats. Saudi Arabia is not in a position to harm the United States. In fact, when it comes to relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia, Washington has all of the leverage. American policymakers shouldn\u2019t forget that.All of this is at risk if the dispute worsens between Saudi Arabia and the United States over Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. Not only could the Saudis not retaliate because their economy is so intertwined with that of the United States, but they will also be susceptible to pressure. Targeted sanctions \u2014 if it comes to that \u2014 could force consultants to withdraw or cut off the Saudi Public Investment Fund\u2019s access to the profits of its investments. More likely, though, is that a continuing dispute would force American businesses like AMC to seriously reconsider involvement in the country because of negative publicity.What about oil? Whereas Saudi Arabia could once shock the world economy by cutting oil exports or production to raise prices, it no longer has that power. The oil market today is significantly more diverse than it was in 1973, when Saudi Arabia and other Arab petroleum exporters unilaterally raised the price of oil and unsettled the American economy. In fact, the United States now produces more oil than Saudi Arabia, and imports make up a smaller percentage of domestically refined crude oil.The Saudis are dependent on the United States, and public opinion is increasingly against them. Already, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has backed out of a high profile finance conference in Riyadh next week. Mr. Trump could use this as a chance to pressure Riyadh to come around on some of his real priorities: the peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians that Jared Kushner is trying to broker; a resolution to the dispute with Qatar, which hosts a critical American military base; billions of dollars more in purchases from American industries.Saudi Arabia is not in a position to threaten the American economy.

{"Headline": "How the Hedge Fund Manager Running Sears Cut His Losses", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEdward S. Lampert, who leads the struggling retailer, has taken control of valuable real estate and businesses.The hedge fund manager Edward S. Lampert has spent the last 14 years steering Sears as it spun off businesses, took on debt and, this week, filed for bankruptcy protection.It has been a long, and often painful, trip, but how has Mr. Lampert fared?His hedge fund, ESL Investments, appears to have racked up a much more modest loss than the company\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing would suggest, according to corporate filings and interviews with analysts and investors.ESL\u2019s nearly 50 percent stake in Sears will probably be wiped out in bankruptcy. But that loss is offset by gains elsewhere. For example, Mr. Lampert has collected hundreds of millions of dollars in interest and fees from Sears. He also took stakes in businesses that were spun off from the company, and some of those investments are doing well. He and his hedge fund played an unusual role at Sears. In addition to being the company\u2019s controlling shareholder, ESL was one of its biggest lenders. Mr. Lampert is the retailer\u2019s chairman and, until Monday, he was also its chief executive.For years, the company warned investors in regulatory filings that his interests \u201cmay be different than your interests\u201d \u2014 a disclaimer that few publicly traded companies make.But Mr. Lampert said he had always acted in the best interests of Sears. During a speech on Tuesday at the company\u2019s headquarters in Hoffman Estates, Ill., he told employees that he could have cashed out years ago. Instead, he said, he \u201cdoubled down.\u201d\u201cI did everything I could think of to try to make this company great again,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Lampert said, according to an audio recording of his remarks obtained by The New York Times.Here\u2019s how he made out on the various parts of Sears.LossIn 2005, Mr. Lampert orchestrated one of the biggest retail mergers in history by using the discount retailer Kmart to buy the department-store giant Sears & Company.The deal was a wild success \u2014 at least in the early years. The stock of the combined company, Sears Holdings, soared, and ESL\u2019s investment was worth $5 billion by 2007. The company was flush with cash and spent $6 billion buying back its own stock from 2005 through 2012. The hedge fund did not sell any of its shares.Critics, including former Sears executives and employees, said the money would have been better spent improving Sears and Kmart stores and developing a better digital strategy. Mr. Lampert has said that he put money into stores and the online business, but that the investments did not pay off.The good times did not last long. Sales started sliding in 2007, and the company\u2019s steady profits turned into big losses a few years later. Sears needed money, and it increasingly turned to the Bank of Lampert for cash.The hedge fund has also collected about $400 million in interest and fees on that debt, helping to reduce Mr. Lampert\u2019s losses on the company\u2019s stock to about $300 million.WinSears acquired Lands\u2019 End in 2002, hoping to bolster its struggling apparel business. But the preppy clothing never quite fit in at a company that made much of its money selling home appliances, tools and other household necessities. Lands\u2019 End lost ground to the likes of L.L. Bean in part because its clothing was mostly sold in worn-out Sears stores and on an outdated website. In 2014, Sears spun the business off into a separate publicly traded company. ESL got 15.4 million shares, or nearly half, of the new company, at no additional cost.ESL and its affiliates bought six million more shares of Lands\u2019 Ends as the stock price climbed. Their stake is now worth about $207 million.LossTo raise cash, Sears spun off a number of other divisions. In almost every transaction, ESL bought shares in the new companies, becoming a significant or even the majority owner. For the most part, these corporate offspring have struggled or failed.In the case of Sears Canada, Mr. Lampert came close to making a profit. When the company was partially spun off from Sears Holdings in 2012, ESL got a 28 percent stake at no additional cost. The hedge fund collected $168 million in special dividends that Sears Canada paid out that year and in 2013. WinMany Wall Street analysts and investors have speculated that Mr. Lampert\u2019s primary interest in Sears was its real estate. The retailer had hundreds of stores in prime malls and shopping plazas across the United States. These properties could be sold to more profitable retailers or become something else entirely, like movie theaters, condominiums or offices.ESL invested $745 million, and Mr. Lampert became Seritage\u2019s chairman. Its share price has soared 45 percent since its initial public offering and prominent investors like Warren E. Buffett have bought into the company. Mr. Lampert\u2019s stake in this business is now worth approximately $1.1 billion.UnclearBut Mr. Lampert could still end up with what\u2019s left of its other real estate and businesses. On Monday, he said he hoped to buy 400 profitable Sears and Kmart stores. If his bid is the highest, Mr. Lampert could continue to run the stores with no debt and less costly leases or he could sell off some of the best locations.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "WarnerMedia Plans to Unveil Streaming Service by End of 2019", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGet ready for the streaming wars.AT&T announced on Wednesday that it plans to unveil a digital video service featuring WarnerMedia\u2019s films and television shows by the end of next year, moving it into direct competition with rivals like Netflix, Disney and Amazon.\u201cWe are committed to launching a compelling and competitive product that will serve as a complement to our existing businesses and help us to expand our reach by offering a new choice for entertainment with the WarnerMedia collection of films, television series, libraries, documentaries and animation loved by consumers around the world,\u201d John Stankey, who oversees WarnerMedia, said in a statement.That means that blockbuster Warner movies like the Harry Potter franchise and \u201cWonder Woman\u201d could show up on the service next to TV shows like \u201cFriends\u201d and HBO hits like \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201dMr. Stankey appeared on Wednesday at a conference hosted by Vanity Fair in Los Angeles but did not offer details about how much the service will cost, what its name will be or the date it will become available.\u201cWe\u2019re going to bring a fresh approach to how the media and entertainment industry works for consumers, content creators, distributors and advertisers,\u201d Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said at the time.WarnerMedia already licenses its films and shows to other streaming businesses, but it will have to forgo that revenue once it carries that content exclusively for its own service. \u201cFriends,\u201d for example, a WarnerMedia property, is licensed to Netflix in a deal that will run out in a few years.In an interview after his appearance, Mr. Stankey estimated that a quarter of the WarnerMedia library licensed to other streaming services comes up for renewal every year.WarnerMedia already has several streaming products. Its best known is HBO Now, which was introduced in 2015 and now has over five million customers. Last month, WarnerMedia started selling a video subscription service offering feature films and shows based on characters from DC Comics, another Warner property, that is being heavily marketed across studio lots in Hollywood.Mr. Stankey described the new service as a \u201ccollection of boutiques,\u201d with HBO as its \u201canchor tenant.\u201dAs part of the introduction, HBO will sharply ramp up its programming slate, Mr. Stankey said. But HBO itself will remain focused on high-end entertainment and not become a warehouse for all Warner content, as some had feared.Later in that meeting, he said HBO must \u201cbuild that brand so that it\u2019s broad enough to make that happen.\u201dNow, it appears the streaming service would be more akin to a high-end mall, with HBO bringing in new customers.\u201cHBO is a really important brand, a really important property for us,\u201d he said at the conference. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t think HBO as its own stand-alone brand will meet the needs of the broad scale of audience and customers that we want to address.\u201dThough declining to say how much the coming service would cost, Mr. Stankey said that it would be more than HBO Now, which costs $15 a month. In addition to HBO and some Warner Bros. films, it will most likely include shows from its TV library. It will not include CNN.Notably, AT&T\u2019s service will coincide with a new offering from the Walt Disney Company, which also plans to start a streaming product next year.Disney beat out Comcast in a fierce bidding war for the majority of 21st Century Fox, pushing to win the streaming market by stocking up on valuable content.\u201cDisney doesn\u2019t have a paid premium service like we do with HBO,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cWe\u2019re also AT&T. We already have tens of millions of direct consumer relationships.\u201dComparing AT&T\u2019s approach to Disney\u2019s, he added, \u201cWhat\u2019s important to understand is that ours is a unified offering \u2014 we\u2019re not expecting people to buy three different pieces.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "In \u2018Homecoming,\u2019 a Sound Experiment Becomes Something to See", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the podcast\u2019s creators, Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg, that meant everything depended on the characters. \u201cYou can\u2019t hide behind cinematography or good-looking actors or costumes,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have action sequences. You can\u2019t have sex, really, in any kind of convincing or interesting way. The only thing you have is an engaging scene.\u201dThe result is the Amazon Prime series \u201cHomecoming,\u201d which debuts Nov. 2 and has already been renewed for a second season. In the adaptation, Roberts plays Heidi Bergman, a caseworker charged with helping combat veterans readjust to civilian life. As a therapist at the Homecoming Transitional Support Center, Heidi becomes close to one of her patients, Walter Cruz (Stephan James), a veteran eager to get better, and butts heads with Colin Belfast (Bobby Cannavale), her condescending, insufferable boss. The series toggles between the present day and 2022, when Heidi is a waitress at a rundown seafood shack, with seemingly little memory of her past life or job.Work on the TV adaptation began in earnest in December 2016, when Universal Cable Productions purchased the rights to the story and began sending out feelers for a director. Esmail, a fan of the podcast, which stars Catherine Keener (Heidi), Oscar Isaac (Walter) and David Schwimmer (Colin), initially balked at the idea of an adaptation, figuring why screw up an already good thing? After bingeing the show three times, however, Esmail began to see the possibilities, and not just because it shared many of the same themes \u2014 shadowy corporate machinations, creepy 24/7 surveillance \u2014 as his award-winning \u201cMr. Robot.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not like I read the script and said, well, it\u2019s got an evil corporation and paranoia, I\u2019m in,\u201d he said.He saw it more as a throwback to the character-based thrillers of Hitchcock and De Palma, and a month later, after pitching his vision to Horowitz and Bloomberg, he got the job. As it turned out, Roberts was also a big fan of the podcast (she binged the show, she said, while sorting thousands of Lego bricks in her younger son\u2019s bedroom), and the two met over FaceTime to talk about the possibility of working together. Esmail was getting married in two weeks (to the \u201cShameless\u201d star Emmy Rossum), so for the first 45 minutes, Roberts peppered him with questions about the wedding, while Esmail asked her about her kids. \u201cWe were like girlfriends,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cIt was like we had gone to high school together.\u201dRoberts ultimately agreed to the project, with two conditions. \u201cOn the top of the list was that Sam had to direct all the episodes,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I needed Micah and Eli to write all of the scripts before we started shooting.\u201d (Esmail was originally planning to direct just the first two episodes, but a yearlong hiatus for \u201cMr. Robot\u201d allowed him to fulfill Roberts\u2019s request.)With the cast and crew largely in place, Horowitz and Bloomberg began writing the show\u2019s first season. \u201cWe had a huge advantage coming out of a podcast, because we felt that we had already tested this at an elemental, molecular level,\u201d Bloomberg said.For the podcast, the pair had created simple auditory cues to let the listener know where they were; the bubbling sounds of a fish tank inside Heidi\u2019s office, for instance. The production designer Anastasia White, who works with Esmail on \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d adapted the aquarium motif, coming up with everything from the compound\u2019s muted green color scheme and fishbowl feel (the center\u2019s cafeteria doubles as feeding station and surveillance area) to the school of silvery fish on the facility\u2019s walls. \u201cAll this stuff is because we liked the sound of bubbles,\u201d Horowitz said.There\u2019s something unsettling about the facility, as if some clueless corporate entity had taken over an abandoned office building, shoved all the old desks and chairs into spare rooms, and hired a design firm to convert the place into a supposedly restful rehab center. (That is indeed the site\u2019s back story.) The vibe of the place is tropical and Florida, but with meds, and government creeps. \u201cPineapples are a recurring theme,\u201d White said.To differentiate between 2018 and 2022, Tod Campbell, the director of photography, alternated between a full-frame, 16:9 aspect ratio (when Heidi is still relatively lucid) to a more confined square box format (after Heidi has lost large chunks of her memory). For the phone conversations between Colin and Heidi, he shot the two in split screen, \u201cfacing away from each other, because they\u2019re always at odds,\u201d he said. \u201cOr sometimes she\u2019s small in the frame, sitting on a park bench, and he\u2019s in close-up, his big face yelling at her.\u201dPlotwise, the series hews pretty closely to the original \u2014 there\u2019s just a lot more of it. The creators added several characters that deepen our understanding of what\u2019s going on behind the scenes (Alex Karpovsky, as the compound\u2019s life skills coach and company rat) and in the corporate overlords\u2019s heads (Marianne Jean-Baptiste, as Walter\u2019s not-buying-it mom). Some scenes are simply more dramatic in the series, as events in the podcast that we only learn about later through surreptitious recordings are presented in real time.Both creators struggled to keep the show from spinning out into some large-scale \u201cgenre, paranoid thriller,\u201d Horowitz said. \u201cThe natural tendency is to go bigger, but the solution was really to go more human.\u201dThey have found that working on the series has been both easier than the podcast (\u201cyou can actually show a sign, as opposed to figuring out a way for characters to reveal what the sign says,\u201d Horowitz said), and less frenzied (65 days to shoot the 10-episode season, versus four days to record Season 1 of the podcast). And there are more folks helping out. As grips and assorted other crew members scurried by, the two craned their necks, looks of astonishment on their faces. \u201cLook at all these people!,\u201d Horowitz marveled.But rabid fans of the podcast need not fret; the podcast will continue and the TV offshoot can be a complementary experience. \u201cPart of the reason we deviated from the podcast was that I wanted people to be able to enjoy both without having to sacrifice one of them,\u201d Esmail said. \u201cI really wanted to treat the TV show as its own creature.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Japan, the Kit Kat Isn\u2019t Just a Chocolate. It\u2019s an Obsession.", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times. She has won two James Beard Foundation awards for restaurant criticism.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce.

The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands.

According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era.

It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate.

Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa.

Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.For millions of Latin Americans, the Colombina factory in La Paila is the place where sweet moments are made.Leer en enspa\u00f1olFor nearly 50 years, Bon Bon Bums have been produced in the Colombina factory in La Paila, north of Cali. At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Making Sense of the Selling in the Stock Market", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome stock declines are more foreboding than others.The selling that has driven down the markets continued on Friday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 9 percent from its peak in September, and on pace for its worst month since the 2008 financial crisis. Swoons like this one can be unnerving, in part because they suggest all is not well with the broader economy.But some of the selling may not augur much.Take technology stocks, whose recent declines have played a big role in dragging down the overall market. Shares of big tech companies have soared this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up more than 17 percent at its peak this year and 55 percent since Donald J. Trump was elected president.That left tech stocks vulnerable to a sharp sell-off.That\u2019s why the declines in shares of companies like Netflix and Amazon this month say more about their stock market valuations than the state of the wider economy.Earlier this year, Netflix was trading at 110 times the earnings Wall Street analysts expected the company to make over the next 12 months, according to FactSet. That multiple is many times that of the wider market and suggests that investors were confident Netflix would deliver on its ambitious goals. But big questions, including its ability to finance its growth and rising competition, hang over the company. The drop in Netflix\u2019s stock is thus evidence of healthy skepticism, rather than kneejerk bearishness about its future.But other selling cannot be so easily shrugged off.Bank stocks are down a lot this year. That\u2019s despite a strong economy, which typically leads to increased lending activity; rising interest rates, which have bolstered the profitability of banks\u2019 core lending business; the tax cuts enacted last year, which had an outsize effect on bank profits; and hopes for deregulation. Yet the shares of Citigroup, the nation\u2019s third largest bank, are down nearly 20 percent from their high earlier this year. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are all down about 15 percent this year.If bank stocks are a barometer for the economy, their poor performance points to some of the questions that keep investors up at night. Will President Trump\u2019s trade war soon start to do real damage to corporate earnings and the global economy? Will the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases crimp economic activity by depriving companies and households of the loans they need to finance purchases?A rout helps investors decide what\u2019s worth really worrying about. With the United States economy growing strongly, they may soon decide they\u2019ve been freaking out too much. A sustained upturn in bank stocks may show that their optimism is returning. But if they remain in the doldrums, real trouble may lie ahead.Advertisement"}

Millie Tran, a global growth editor for The Times, discussed the tech she\u2019s using.Then think of all the different and potential audience segments. Each will have slightly different formulas, and you have to constantly experiment, learn and calibrate. In practice, that means I\u2019m looking at a lot of data, reading a lot of reports, talking to a lot of people, trying to understand all these different contexts, and working to distill and communicate everything I\u2019m learning to the rest of the newsroom.What tech tools do you rely on to keep track of audience and expanding our audience?I\u2019m a big fan of contextualizing any number or piece of data, whether that\u2019s for benchmarking (is that higher or lower than we expected?) or explaining why we care about that figure (is it connected to our newsroom, to business goals or to both?). It\u2019s making a piece of information more sophisticated but also simplifying it. It comes down to our audience: How can I help my colleagues around the newsroom empathize more with our readers, viewers and listeners around the world?What is your personal tech setup like?It has changed a lot over the years. Almost a decade ago, I wrote my college senior thesis on cyberwar and taught a seminar on the same subject, so I used to be hypervigilant about all of that. Then, when I was working on the launch of the BuzzFeed News app and newsletter, I had my iPhone, an Android and lots of news apps to check out their push notifications, and email apps to test how an email would be experienced and read. (I was most recently the director of global adaptation at BuzzFeed.)Since starting work on international growth, I\u2019ve simplified my hardware \u2014 mostly one phone, an iPhone X, and my good old Moto X when I need to see something on Android \u2014 but I have as many apps as ever: 314.In terms of apps and software, I am constantly tinkering and trying new apps. For (mostly) work, it\u2019s the whole Google suite, Slack, Things for my to-dos, Bear for notes, Instapaper, Nuzzel, Spotify, Pocket Casts and, of course, the New York Times app. I\u2019m looking for a better mail app right now. The apps I use daily for everything else are Citymapper, Citi Bike, Weather Underground (though I have a whole folder of weather apps), Sleep Cycle and Nike Training.Translating our articles for non-English-speaking audiences is one growth avenue. What do you think of translation software? Or is it better to rely on people? Why?What tech do you and your family love outside of work? My best friends and family are all over the place, so there\u2019s a lot of video chatting through FaceTime, Google Hangouts or Facebook Messenger. I love randomly FaceTiming my friends.I travel to Vietnam every year to see my family, and it\u2019s incredible how quickly they\u2019ve all adopted Facebook, Uber and a bunch of other apps. Viber used to be the primary way for us to communicate, but now we\u2019re mostly chatting on Messenger.Finally, lots of travel sites and apps to find good flight deals to get to all of them!What do you do to take a break from tech?Honestly, I\u2019m rarely without my phone or some piece of technology and do believe in making tech work for me and my life, not the other way around. That said, I\u2019m a very tactile person, and you obviously lose a lot of that when you work on the internet. So I love activities like grocery and clothes shopping, and I love my plants and the deeply satisfying feeling of watching something you take care of grow.

{"Headline": "Trump and the Failure of the American Tax System", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe tax system is made for people like Trump, but not for the rest of us.Professor Madoff teaches at Boston College Law School and is an expert on estate planning and tax policy. This would not be as troubling if the richest Americans paid more income taxes. But most of the wealth they acquire is not taxed as income. This situation \u2014 generous exclusions from income taxes combined with easy evasion of estate and gift taxes \u2014 has given the wealthiest a free pass on the costs of running the country.How do income taxes apply to these ways of acquiring wealth? They don\u2019t.Like Donald Trump, many of the Forbes 400 acquired some or all of their wealth from their parents. These transfers of wealth pass entirely free of income taxes. This may be surprising, because the income tax purports to be imposed on \u201call income from whatever source derived\u201d \u2014 and the I.R.S. is clear that this should be interpreted broadly to include not just a person\u2019s salary, but also unemployment benefits, lottery winnings and even the cash value of bartered items. There is not even a requirement to report that money on a tax return. This allows the wealthy to believe that their tax liability is more burdensome than it actually is. Imagine a person with a $1 million salary (subject to $350,000 in income taxes) and a $100 million inheritance. Since he has to report only that $1 million, he might think he is paying taxes at a rate of 35 percent, when his actual tax burden is less than 1 percent of the wealth he acquired that year.The second way that the ultrarich make their wealth is through building or investing in businesses. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, is the ultimate example of the successful entrepreneur. With wealth topping $160 billion, Mr. Bezos is not only the wealthiest American, but is also estimated to be the richest person in the world.While these changes are fiscally significant, the lobbying effort\u2019s greatest impact was rhetorical: It shifted the conversation about the estate tax as a legitimate tax to one that \u201cimposes double taxation\u201d and \u201churts family farms and businesses.\u201d These families took an issue that applied to less than 2 percent of Americans and made it a populist rallying cry against \u201cdeath taxes.\u201d As a result, repeal of the estate tax has become one of the core tenets of the Republican Party, while Democrats hardly bring the topic up at all, leaving Congress with little appetite for closing loopholes. Indeed, the last time that Congress adopted any legislation closing estate tax loopholes was 1990.This has let taxpayers artificially reduce the value of their estates just long enough for them to pass from one generation to the next. Three common techniques \u2014 minority discounts, grantor-retained annuity trusts and family limited partnerships \u2014 were all used by the Trumps. What is to be done about this situation?To begin with, let\u2019s introduce honesty into the debate. For too long, we have allowed the perpetuation of the myth that the super-wealthy are subject to greater tax burdens than regular Americans. That\u2019s simply not true, and we need to recognize that.The measure of a well-functioning democracy is a tax system that fairly apportions its burdens. When we go to the polls next month, we would do well to keep in mind the importance of electing officials who represent the interests of everyone and not just the wealthiest among us.An earlier version of this article included an incorrect reference to a list of wealthy Americans. It is the Forbes 400, as the article noted elsewhere, not the Fortune 400.Advertisement"}

The rise pulled the stock market back into positive territory for 2018 a day after a turbulent session had erased the last of the year\u2019s gains. Stocks are now up 1.2 percent this year.The rally on Thursday was a rare upward jolt in what has been a rough run for stocks. Investors have dumped shares over the past month, worried about factors that could threaten the economic and profit outlook for 2019, including the trade war with China, the Fed\u2019s plans to keep raising interest rates and the midterm elections.Those worries have largely outweighed the strong third-quarter sales and profit numbers that companies have reported since earnings season began this month. Thanks to a strong economy and corporate tax cuts, third-quarter profits for S.&P. 500 companies were on track to be up more than 22 percent, according to an analysis of reported results and projections by the market data firm Refinitiv.Instead, investors are scanning results for any indication \u2014 either in the profit guidance companies offer to analysts or in commentary from executives \u2014 that their fears of a rocky time ahead are warranted.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the guidance,\u201d said Maneesh Deshpande, head of United States equity strategy at Barclays. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really driving stock movements.\u201dOn Thursday, stock in International Paper rose 10.3 percent after it posted better-than-expected results. Executives said they expected strong sales and profit performance \u201cto continue into the fourth quarter and into 2019.\u201d The chip giant Intel rose 4.5 percent after it raised its profit guidance for next year. Xilinx, a maker of programmable chips used in large data centers, shot up more than 15 percent after it increased full-year profit guidance.And Xilinx was only the S.&P. 500\u2019s second-best performer.Twitter posted its results, with revenue and profit topping forecasts, before the start of trading on Thursday, and its stock jumped 15.5 percent. Large tech companies also climbed. Shares of Microsoft, which reported positive results after the close of trading on Wednesday, rose 5.8 percent.The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose nearly 3 percent and is now up 6 percent for the year, but is nonetheless down 9.8 percent from its peak in early September.If investors were hoping that Thursday\u2019s rise means the latest period of volatility is at an end, they\u2019ll most likely be disappointed.Amazon, which rose more than 7 percent during the day, promptly tumbled in after-hours trading, after the release of its earnings report, which included a holiday forecast investors found underwhelming. And Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, whose shares had risen, dropped sharply when its results likewise disappointed.As long as investors feel that they don\u2019t have a good sense of what next year will look like, such volatility will almost certainly continue. More market swings could leave it ultimately treading water until conditions become more clear, Mr. Deshpande said.\u201cUntil we get through this we\u2019re just going to have this range-bound and very choppy market,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

His election is also a referendum on the fate of the Amazon: the world\u2019s largest tropical forest, sometimes known as the lungs of the Earth.The stakes for the planet are huge.He has dismissed the idea of setting aside forest land for native Brazilians who have lived in the Amazon for centuries, promising that \u201cthere won\u2019t be a square centimeter demarcated as an indigenous reserve\u201d under his leadership. In the Amazon, deforestation has long been caused by illegal ranching, logging and the conversion of forests into farms. Global demand for beef, one of Brazil\u2019s top commodities, is growing. The United States-China trade feud has increased the demand for soy, Brazil\u2019s other top commodity, as well.Until recently, Brazil had been lauded as an environmental leader. It had pledged zero illegal deforestation by 2030 under the Paris agreement and sharp reductions in its carbon emissions as a whole.A crippling recession also has also taken a toll, resulting in sharply reduced funding for the Environment Ministry. The recent rollback of conservation measures reflects the growing influence of a powerful conservative wing within Brazil\u2019s legislature that calls itself the Beef, Bible and Bullet Coalition.

{"Headline": "Sears Went From Gilded-Age Boom to Digital-Age Bankruptcy", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe retailer was the innovator of its time, building a thriving mail-order business before going brick-and-mortar. Now, much of that is going away. To an entire generation of young shoppers, Sears is the store they least want to visit in the mall they rarely patronize.But for much of its 132-year history, the company was at the forefront of American retail. Its early mail-order and distribution innovations made it the Amazon of the Gilded Age.In the last decade, however, little of that splendor has been evident. The company has lost money for years, its head count has fallen by hundreds of thousands of employees, and it has several thousand fewer stores than it did in 2008. Even the landmark Sears Tower in Chicago \u2014 which it no longer owns \u2014 was renamed, after an insurance company. Here are some key moments in Sears history.1886 Richard Sears, a railway station agent, started the R.W. Sears Watch Company in Minneapolis after buying a batch of watches from a local jeweler and selling them to fellow agents. The next year, he moved the business to Chicago and hired Alvah C. Roebuck, a watchmaker, through a classified ad.189619061925Nearly 40 years after going into business, the company opened its first retail store, in Chicago. Within five years, it had more than 300 outlets, selling in-house brands like Kenmore and Craftsman.The expansion was coordinated by Robert E. Wood, a general during World War I. He realized, while examining census data, that increasingly mobile Americans were moving into and around cities and wanted to browse products in person.The company later created Allstate Insurance, a nod to the growing number of customers with cars. In 1931, retail sales topped mail-order sales.1957The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index debuted with Sears as one of the original members (a position the company exited in 2012). The company was part of the Dow Jones industrial average from 1924 until 1999.197319811989199220052013201520172018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Paul G. Allen, Microsoft\u2019s Co-Founder, Is Dead at 65", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Allen was a force at Microsoft during its first seven years, along with its co-founder, Bill Gates, as the personal computer was moving from a hobbyist curiosity to a mainstream technology, used by both businesses and consumers.When the company was founded, in 1975, the machines were known as microcomputers, to distinguish the desktop computers from the hulking machines of the day. Mr. Allen came up with the name Micro-Soft, an apt one for a company that made software for small computers. The term personal computer would become commonplace later.The company\u2019s first product was a much-compressed version of the Basic programming language, designed to suit those underpowered machines. Yet the company\u2019s big move came when it promised the computer giant IBM that it would deliver the operating system software for IBM\u2019s entry into the personal computer business. Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen committed to supplying that software in 1980.At the time, it was a promise without a product. But Mr. Allen was instrumental in putting together a deal to buy an early operating system from a programmer in Seattle. He and Mr. Gates tweaked and massaged the code, and it became the operating system that guided the IBM personal computer, introduced in 1981.That product, called Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS, was a watershed for the company. Later would come Microsoft\u2019s immensely popular Windows operating system, designed to be used with a computer mouse and onscreen icons \u2014 point-and-click computing rather than typed commands. The company would also produce the Office productivity programs for word processing, spreadsheets and presentations.Mr. Allen\u2019s partnership with Mr. Gates began when they were teenagers attending the private Lakeside School in Seattle. It was there that they got their start in computing, working from a school Teletype terminal that was linked to a far-away mainframe computer under a so-called time-sharing computer system, in which operators paid for the computing time they used. Funds for the system were originally supplied by proceeds from a school bake sale.Mr. Allen scored a perfect 1,600 on his SAT test, and went on to Washington State University. But after two years he dropped out to work as a programmer for Honeywell in Boston. Mr. Gates was nearby, attending Harvard University.When an early microcomputer was introduced, appearing on the cover of Popular Electronics magazine, Mr. Allen persuaded Mr. Gates to drop out of Harvard and move to Albuquerque, where a start-up called MITS had built a machine that has been credited as the first personal computer. The machine lacked software, and Mr. Allen and Mr. Gates, showing up at the MITS offices, promised that they could supply it.Their first offering was Microsoft Basic. Both Mr. Gates and Mr. Allen were skilled code creators, but Mr. Gates was more the hard-charging, volatile businessman, while Mr. Allen played the peacemaker and negotiator in those early days.Within a few years, Microsoft moved from New Mexico to suburban Seattle. Though Mr. Allen stepped away from daily duties at Microsoft in the early 1980s, partly because of a deteriorating relationship with Mr. Gates, he remained on the Microsoft board until 2000.Mr. Allen left Microsoft after he learned he had lymphoma. But tensions had also flared with both Mr. Gates and Steven A. Ballmer, a close lieutenant who eventually succeeded Mr. Gates as chief executive. In his 2011 memoir, \u201cIdea Man,\u201d Mr. Allen recalled overhearing the two talk about reducing his stake in the company.\u201cThey were bemoaning my recent lack of production and discussing how they might dilute my Microsoft equity by issuing options to themselves and other shareholders,\u201d Mr. Allen wrote.But Mr. Allen held his ground and his shares.Mr. Gates said in a statement on Monday: \u201cFrom our early days together at Lakeside School, through our partnership in the creation of Microsoft, to some of our joint philanthropic projects over the years, Paul was a true partner and dear friend. Personal computing would not have existed without him.\u201dAs Microsoft became the dominant personal computer software company, Mr. Allen, as well as Mr. Gates, who was the face of the company, became immensely wealthy. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, he had a net worth of $26.1 billion.He was also an investor and a generous philanthropist.Mr. Allen donated more than $2 billion toward nonprofit groups dedicated to the advancement of science, technology, education, the environment and the arts. Among the scientific research organizations he funded were the Allen Institute for Brain Science in 2003 and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in 2014.And while some of his philanthropy was global, like a passion for ending elephant poaching, much of his post-Microsoft work centered on Seattle, where he became a transformative force behind many of the city\u2019s leading cultural institutions.He restored the old Cinerama movie theater to modern standards seemingly ideal for watching science-fiction films, and he hired Frank Gehry to design the Museum of Pop Culture, which Mr. Allen founded in 2000 under the original name of the Experience Music Project. The wild, undulating building displayed items revealing Mr. Allen\u2019s cultural obsessions, including guitars owned by Jimi Hendrix and Captain Kirk\u2019s command chair from the 1960s television series \u201cStar Trek.\u201dIn the 1990s, Mr. Allen bought a swath of land in the South Lake Union neighborhood to help build a Seattle version of Central Park, but the public ultimately voted down the plans. He took those real estate holdings and, through his company, Vulcan, developed South Lake Union into the home of Amazon. Google and other tech companies have been opening offices in that now revitalized neighborhood.\u201cHe has a definitive role of what we understand as today\u2019s Seattle, which is about technology, about real estate and about a distinctive local culture with international visibility,\u201d said Margaret O\u2019Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington.Mr. Allen also used his wealth to acquire the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association in 1988 and the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League in 1996.Yet in 1988, at 35, he bought the Trail Blazers and promised to keep the franchise in the city, one of the smallest in the league. He often flew to games from Seattle and sat courtside with his mother. Soon after he bought the team, the Trail Blazers had one of their best runs in franchise history, making it to the N.B.A. finals twice in three years, losing both times.In a statement, Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, called Mr. Allen \u201cthe ultimate trail blazer \u2014 in business, philanthropy and in sports.\u201d Mr. Silver said Mr. Allen, one of the longest-tenured owners in the league, was particularly interested in the league\u2019s growth internationally and its embrace of new technologies.Mr. Allen set about building the team a new home downtown. The team moved into CenturyLink Field in 2002, and Mr. Allen spent hundreds of millions of dollars to upgrade the stadium. Though he spoke infrequently to the media, he could often be seen at games, sometimes raising the \u201c12\u201d flag \u2014 representing the fans \u2014 before kickoff, a team ritual.During his tenure the Seahawks made their only three Super Bowl appearances, winning the title once, in 2014.\u201cI personally valued Paul\u2019s advice on subjects ranging from collective bargaining to bringing technology to our game,\u201d Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. Commissioner, said in a statement.One of Allen\u2019s companies also owned a stake in the Seattle Sounders, one of the most successful franchises in Major League Soccer. The Sounders won the league title in 2016.Paul Gardner Allen was born in Seattle on Jan. 21, 1953, to Kenneth and Edna (Faye) Allen. His father was a librarian; his mother a schoolteacher. He is survived by his sister, Jody Allen.Three years ago, when commemorating Microsoft\u2019s 40th anniversary, Mr. Allen posted on Twitter a bit of the code for the company\u2019s first software product. At the top, it said, \u201cCopyright 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s weird to look at bits of code you wrote 40 years ago and think, \u2018That led to where Microsoft is today,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Allen said at the time. He sounded genuinely amazed.An earlier version of this obituary misstated the cities in which Mr. Allen owned professional sports teams. He owned an N.F.L. team in Seattle and an N.B.A. team in Portland, Ore.; the teams were not both in Seattle.An earlier version of this obituary misspelled Mr. Allen\u2019s middle name. It is Gardner, not Gardener.Ken Belson and Karen Weise contributed reporting from Seattle.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Tech Drove Stocks Skyward. It Was a Different Story on the Way Down.", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLarge technology companies, and the big profits they produce, lifted the markets earlier this year. But during October\u2019s tumble they were only part of a broad-based downturn. The world\u2019s largest technology companies drove the stock market to record highs earlier this year. As stocks have tumbled, though, it\u2019s more like they\u2019re just along for the ride.Unlike the rally, the rout that started in late September and dominated trading in October was a broad-based affair. That suggests that investors are less concerned that the tech giants\u2019 shares rose too far too fast, and are instead worried about the fundamentals of the United States economy and the continuing profitability of companies of all kinds.October was particularly painful for investors. At its worst, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down more than 9 percent during the month. A late charge took some of the sharp edge off: The S.&P. 500 was up around 1 percent on Wednesday, its second straight gain, helping to cut losses for the month to around 7 percent. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that\u2019s bothering the markets and I think it\u2019s fears about earnings estimates,\u201d said Randy Watts, chief investment strategist with the investment advisory firm William O\u2019Neil & Company. And only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. There are plenty of factors worrying investors: President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.\u201cDespite the fact that earnings are exceptional by any objective measure, investors are concerned that they will slow more dramatically than expected next year,\u201d said Jason DeSena Trennert, managing partner at Strategas Research Partners, a markets and economic analysis firm. The tech companies\u2019 declines are not minor, but they are not big enough to signal that investors are overly concerned about the health of the stocks that fueled so much of the gains of the past decade.

It is also a significant increase from 6.4 percent last year. Men and women are equally represented among those characters, whereas men made up 55 percent of the characters last year.The report also found that, for the first time, L.G.B.T.Q. characters currently include more people of color (50 percent) than white people (49 percent). Strides have been made in the number of bisexual, transgender and H.I.V.-positive characters as well.\u201cNot only do stories that explore the rich lives and identities of L.G.B.T.Q. people move the needle forward culturally, but they pay off in ratings,\u201d said Sarah Kate Ellis, the president and chief executive of Glaad. \u201cShows like \u2018Will & Grace,\u2019 \u2018Supergirl,\u2019 \u2018Empire\u2019 and \u2018How to Get Away With Murder\u2019 all attract millions of viewers weekly and demonstrate that audiences are hungry for new stories and perspectives.\u201dBroadcast television can (sort of) pat itself on the back for improvements in terms of race: The percentage of black characters has risen to 22 percent from 18 percent since the previous year, while the percentage of Asian-Pacific Islander characters climbed to 8 percent from 7 percent.

{"Headline": "Climate Change Is on the Ballot", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byClimate Fwd:The midterm elections are around the corner, and here on the climate desk we\u2019ve been looking at how the issue of climate change is playing out around the country.But when you think about how to cast your ballot, don\u2019t just focus on candidates running for the House and the Senate. Take a careful look at candidates running for state and local offices.The power of state officials can be seen in California. By 2016, the last year for which figures are available, the state had reduced its greenhouse gas emissions to levels slightly below its 1990 totals, according to data from the California Air Resources Board. Those gains were primarily because of efforts at the state and local levels, like heavy investments in renewable energies.Even closer to home, local and county elections can also affect emissions through building codes and transit planning.They can also determine who ends up in harm\u2019s way. In many municipalities, planning and zoning commissions are elected positions. And the officials in those positions make decisions like whether to approve development projects in known flood zones. In some places, planning and zoning commission positions are appointed by government officials rather than elected. In those cases, it\u2019s still worth going to meetings and getting a sense of who is appointed and whose interests they\u2019re considering when making decisions.After two years of presenting himself on the world stage as a climate champion, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada has put his money where his mouth is. This month, Mr. Trudeau said he would impose carbon pricing on the four holdout provinces that refused to implement their own measures: Ontario, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and New Brunswick.That sets up a political battle with those provinces and makes climate change a big issue in the next general election, expected in October 2019. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s main rival in Parliament, the Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who represents a district in Saskatchewan, has assailed the plan as a gimmick that will impose undue costs on Canadians.The fight will resonate far beyond Canada because carbon prices are increasingly seen by experts as the most effective policy tool to combat climate change. Mr. Trudeau\u2019s plan would impose a tax of about $15 per ton of carbon dioxide on industrial polluters, rising to about $38 by 2022. Most of the revenue would be returned to citizens in the form of rebates.Politicians in Washington and around the world, many of whom view carbon taxes as political suicide, will be watching closely to see how Mr. Trudeau\u2019s effort plays out.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Romanoffs\u2019 Is Elegant but Frustrating", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs the creator of \u201cMad Men,\u201d Matthew Weiner had a thing about spoilers. Each season arrived with a list of no-nos for critics, such as the number of floors in the advertising office where it was set. When he announced a series for Amazon Prime, I joked that maybe he\u2019d make it a spoiler to say what the new show was about.I have to hand it to him with \u201cThe Romanoffs,\u201d which begins Friday. I\u2019ve seen three episodes, and I couldn\u2019t tell you what the series is if I wanted to.O.K., in broad terms I can. The episodes are stand-alone stories, with different stars and a thin tissue of connection: contemporary characters who are associated with or believe they are descended from the Russian royal family, whose members were executed by Bolsheviks in 1918. (Sorry, spoiler.)I can also say that \u201cThe Romanoffs\u201d is TV only in the broadest sense. The episodes, around an hour and a half in length, are essentially movies. The first three installments are eclectic, sometimes beguiling and each, in a different way, ultimately frustrating.The series begins elegantly, in Paris, with \u201cThe Violet Hour.\u201d Anushka (Marthe Keller), a spiteful, elderly aristocrat, is attended by her American nephew, Greg (Aaron Eckhart), and his sullen French girlfriend, Sophie (Louise Bourgoin). She keeps them in line with the promise of inheriting a Faberg\u00e9 egg and her grand apartment, once used by a Russian royal as a stash pad for his mistress.Greg\u2019s burden is lightened, then complicated, by Anushka\u2019s new caretaker, Hajar (In\u00e8s Melab), a Muslim woman who patiently wears down Anushka\u2019s sourness and racism. They develop an odd, culturally freighted relationship \u2014 the senescent past reconciling itself to Europe\u2019s future \u2014 until the last act blows up the script\u2019s character-building for the sake of a shock ending.\u201cThe Royal We\u201d shifts its setting to American suburbia, and its tone to marital farce. Shelly (Kerry Bish\u00e9) finds herself vacationing alone when her mopey, dissatisfied husband, Michael (Corey Stoll), contrives an excuse to cancel. The catch: The vacation is a themed cruise for Romanov descendants. He is one, but she\u2019s not.Bish\u00e9 is luminous but underserved by the long-suffering-wife role, and the episode finds Michael\u2019s tedious midlife crisis way more absorbing than it is. But the scenes on the cruise \u2014 full of elderly Americans cosplaying as early-20th-century Russian nobles \u2014 are transporting. (A talkative gentleman in the bar keeps smashing his vodka glasses with a flourish; \u201cSir, you have to stop doing that,\u201d the put-upon bartender says.)There\u2019s a sense in both early episodes that the characters have been twisted and soured by family legends they\u2019re doomed to fall short of. \u201cMad Men,\u201d too, was fascinated with the layers of history and the stub ends of the faded gentry. There\u2019s a little Pete Campbell in each of these modern-day nobles.In the third installment, \u201cHouse of Special Purpose,\u201d Olivia (Christina Hendricks), a high-profile actress, is on location in Austria shooting a Romanovs mini-series directed by the imperious Jacqueline (Isabelle Huppert). Huppert is astounding, her brusqueness gradually giving way to mania. The story \u2014 a showbiz sendup with Rod Serling-esque horror elements \u2014 gets increasingly over the top as it goes on.And on. The episodes feel stretched out, and while Amazon clearly invested in the series, which shot in seven countries, it\u2019s not scaled up visually to match. The episodes are movie-length but directed, by Weiner, like television.That said, I love the audacity of the idea, the playfulness of the dialogue, the unpredictability of the storytelling. While shooting the series-with-in-a-series of the third episode, Huppert\u2019s character says jadedly, \u201cThis is exactly what television needs: another period piece with well-dressed mannequins.\u201d\u201cThe Romanoffs\u201d is not that. It\u2019s more like a \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d of relationships, privilege and ruling classes in decline.He\u2019s done that. The first two \u201cRomanoffs\u201d go live Friday, with the other six coming once a week. I might start with \u201cThe Royal We,\u201d which is not necessarily the best of the three but has the best moments, which I am enjoined from describing by the lengthy spoiler list. (Some things never change.)Maybe the whole will add up to more. \u201cMad Men\u201d seasons would often start at a slow roll, only to layer on meaning and incident and build to a breathtaking finish. Only time (if the pattern holds, about 12 hours) will tell.But \u201cThe Romanoffs\u201d does not introduce itself as a Russian nesting doll, one unit fitting into another to form one ingenious artifact. It\u2019s a series of ornate but ponderous creations, a shelf-busting set of Faberg\u00e9 ostrich eggs.Advertisement"}

It may not be able to have it both ways.It\u2019s not Facebook\u2019s size that caused the issues. Size makes a platform attractive to hackers, but it also gives that platform more resources to defend itself. If there were, say, five smaller social networks in place of Facebook, that would probably make the situation far worse, because each would be more vulnerable to attack, and when serious problems arose, it would be harder to track down the bad behavior and figure out how to thwart it.Instead, he argues that there\u2019s a bigger problem: \u201cWe haven\u2019t agreed on a set of goals for how social media should impact civil society.\u201d Before we rush to tear up Facebook, he writes, we should work out if social media can be changed to improve society \u2014 as happened to newspapers, radio and TV \u2014 by demanding more from the companies.Mr. Hoffman concedes, though, that his approach would mean \u201ca long and never-ending process.\u201dMr. Nordhaus was cited for his work on the implications of environmental factors, including climate change. Mr. Romer was cited for his work on the importance of technological change.It\u2019s all about market failure. Left alone, markets will generate too much pollution (Nordhaus) and too few ideas (Romer).Avoiding global warming is expensive. Dealing with the damage that it causes could be financially ruinous.To avoid that fate, the report urges huge transformations of the world economy in the next few years. That means taxing carbon dioxide emissions (perhaps as high as $27,000 per ton by 2100), investments in clean energy (of $2.4 trillion every year through 2035), and a complete end of coal use by 2050.But such swift and unified change is politically unlikely, especially with President Trump intending to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.Traditional Republican donors like Paul Singer are still giving money to the party, but others have broken rank. Seth Klarman, the hedge fund billionaire, plans to give $20 million to Democrats. Other financiers are backing obscure Democratic candidates for Congress.Some of Wall Street\u2019s Democratic supporters say they\u2019re driven by opposition to President Trump. Others see something else at work: \u201cThey just want to follow winners,\u201d the conservative economist Stephen Moore told the NYT.Take Jack Poulson, a research scientist alarmed by Google\u2019s efforts to build a censored search engine for China. He took his concerns to Jeff Dean, the tech giant\u2019s head of A.I. What happened, according to Kate Conger and Cade Metz of the NYT:According to Dr. Poulson, Mr. Dean said that Google complied with surveillance requests from the federal government and asked rhetorically if the company should leave the United States market in protest. Mr. Dean also shared a draft of a company email that read, \u201cWe won\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t provide 100 percent transparency to every Googler, to respect our commitments to customer confidentiality and giving our product teams the freedom to innovate.\u201dThe next day, Dr. Poulson quit.It may be hard for these tech giants to find replacements, as well.

{"Headline": "These Are the World\u2019s Best Candies. Want to Fight About It?", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s.

Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines.

The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.)

But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail.

The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTrade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times.

At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco.

For the \u201cTransparent\u201d creator Jill Soloway, that moment came in 2011 when the author\u2019s father came out as transgender. The phone call, and the ways in which the news changed not just Soloway\u2019s father, but the entire family, inspired the groundbreaking Amazon series \u201cTransparent.\u201d Soloway details this process of creative autofiction in a funny and wise new memoir, \u201cShe Wants It: Desire, Power, and Toppling the Patriarchy.\u201dBefore \u201cTransparent,\u201d Soloway had already been a successful writer and producer for shows like \u201cSix Feet Under\u201d and \u201cUnited States of Tara,\u201d but struggled to gain traction on scripts about relatable women in a Hollywood that still catered to the male gaze. If women characters are expected to be thin and attractive, Soloway wondered, \u201cHow come Judd Apatow gets to cast Seth Rogen, and all the boys in America get to relate to an imperfect fat human as their protagonist?\u201d But when Soloway started writing about Soloway\u2019s dad, doors opened. \u201cI finally had a script about an unlikable Jewish chick \u2014 but it turned out I needed a man to play her to get it made.\u201dYet it was the casting of Jeffrey Tambor, who is not transgender, as the family patriarch, Mort, who comes out as Maura, that provided perhaps the greatest obstacles to the show\u2019s success. At a screening of the pilot at the queer film festival Outfest, Soloway and the cast members faced strong blowback from activists critiquing the show as \u201ctransface\u201d \u2014 a play on blackface \u2014 for \u201cprofiting off trans experience and trans pain.\u201dInstead of quitting, or even responding defensively, Soloway listened, made notes and shifted course. Instituting a \u201cTransfirmative Action Program,\u201d the producers set a goal of hiring at least one trans person per department, a radical way to run a show, even in 2014. The program relied on a set of guidelines called the \u201cTopple Principles\u201d to shape the culture of the show. These dictums ranged from \u201cOur Revolution Must Be Intersectional\u201d to \u201cGather Often\u201d as a way to \u201chonor vulnerability and connect over gratitude.\u201d\u201cMy whole life, I had been the person waiting for the guy to initiate, or at least the person trying to do what might make him do the thing I wanted. What did it mean now that there was a world of women, queer women, who, besides wanting me, might even want to know what I wanted?\u201dAs the narrative progresses, readers witness the strangely symbiotic relationship between Soloway\u2019s private life and the lives of the characters on \u201cTransparent.\u201d In real life Soloway and a new lover made a video about female ejaculation entitled \u201cIf You Build It She Will Come\u201d (an experiment that got Soloway disinvited from the ex-husband\u2019s niece\u2019s bat mitzvah); on \u201cTransparent,\u201d the character Sarah Pfefferman (played by Amy Landecker) reunites with her college girlfriend and ejaculates for the first time. Soloway and the show writers cook up the idea for Sarah\u2019s younger sister, Ali (played by Gaby Hoffman), to go back to college and fall in love with a professor, Leslie Mackinaw (played by Cherry Jones), who\u2019s based on the queer poet Eileen Myles, just as the newly single Soloway meets the real Myles on a panel and falls madly in love. \u201cThis is what\u2019s wrong with writing a TV show about people who are all fragments of you,\u201d Soloway explains. \u201cYou can never tell what comes first, the fiction or the reality.\u201dWhile the \u201cthis is how I made it\u201d story line is fascinating and fun, it\u2019s Soloway\u2019s deeply considered and honestly depicted quest for an authentic self that gives this memoir its depth. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Soloway\u2019s journey is informed by a who\u2019s who of feminist and queer thinkers, including cameos or quotes from the likes of Sarah Schulman, Maggie Nelson, Lili Loofbourow, Julia Serrano, Jennifer Finney Boylan, Susan Sontag and Siri Hustvedt.Accepting the award for outstanding directing for a comedy series at the 2016 Emmys, Soloway made headlines by ending that speech with a call to action, made not once but twice: \u201cTopple the patriarchy!\u201d No one could have predicted that within two years, the #MeToo movement would effectively do just that, bringing down such industry heavyweights as Harvey Weinstein and \u201cTransparent\u2019s\u201d own Tambor. It\u2019s a bitter irony when a show that prides itself on its efforts to dismantle male dominance gets canceled after its star is fired for sexually harassing his trans colleagues. This memoir elicits an essential question: Could making radical art with your radical friends ever actually change the power structure? In the aftermath of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation, it seems unlikely. But, if you\u2019re anything like Jill Soloway, it could at least give you a way to channel your rage into something positive and even beautiful.Alysia Abbott is the author of \u201cFairyland.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "IBM to Buy Red Hat, the Top Linux Distributor, for $34 Billion", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIBM is making a big move to bring more software developers under its wing by acquiring Red Hat, the largest distributor of the popular open-source operating system Linux, for $34 billion.With the deal for Red Hat, IBM is trying to position itself as a kind of corporate \u201cSwitzerland\u201d in cloud computing \u2014 a trusted partner of businesses that are moving to the cloud, but are leery of becoming dependent on one major cloud supplier.In the cloud model, software developers write applications that run on remote data centers. The advantage can be lower costs and faster development of new business software.IBM is a champion of a hybrid approach to cloud computing. That means some crucial data and applications run on cloud technology inside a company\u2019s data centers, while other computing tasks run on the clouds of tech companies.The major third-party cloud platforms are Amazon, Microsoft and Google. Businesses complain that these cloud suppliers include proprietary technology that makes it difficult to switch from one cloud to another.The IBM cloud strategy is to supply both hardware and software for companies to build their own private clouds, and it also has a third-party public cloud offering.IBM, analysts say, cannot really compete broadly with so-called hyperscale cloud companies \u2014 Amazon, Microsoft and Google \u2014 which tap their deep coffers to spend many billions of dollars a year to build more giant data centers.But IBM and Red Hat say they are well placed to be leaders in helping corporations make the transition to cloud computing without getting locked into the technology of an internet giant.The two companies say they plan to offer the technology to link a company\u2019s in-house cloud and multiple third-party clouds.\u201cEnterprises are moving to the cloud but 80 percent of them are not there yet,\u201d said Arvind Krishna, an IBM senior vice president in charge of its hybrid cloud offerings. \u201cWe can provide a much easier path to manage and make secure both private clouds and links to multiple public clouds.\u201dRed Hat, founded in 1993 and based in Raleigh, N.C., has built a profitable business, with $2.4 billion in revenue last year, around open-source software, mainly Linux. Open-source code is distributed free, and can be modified by far-flung programmers, under certain rules.Red Hat has expanded \u2014 and made money \u2014 by offering technical support, quality control, software tools and a forum for collaboration, charging subscription fees.Linux is the preferred operating system for cloud computing. \u201cFor most corporations, hybrid cloud is the only practical way to the cloud,\u201d said Paul Cormier, president for products and technologies at Red Hat.The link with IBM, Mr. Cormier said, will accelerate Red Hat\u2019s progress in the market for corporate cloud migrations.Red Hat will join IBM\u2019s cloud team, the companies said in a joint statement, but as a \u201cdistinct unit\u201d to preserve its independence and neutrality in open-source development.IBM\u2019s offer of $190 a share in cash is more than a 60 percent premium over Red Hat\u2019s closing price on Friday, $116.68 a share.The hefty price tag, said one person close to the deal, who asked not be to identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly, is justified by Red Hat\u2019s growth and strong cash flow.IBM, he said, is paying about 30 times Red Hat\u2019s free cash flow, well below the average for recent software company acquisitions, and it will help lift IBM\u2019s growth and cash flow.The boards of both companies approved the deal, and the sale is expected to close in the second half of next year. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Lazard advised IBM on the deal, and Guggenheim Partners and Morgan Stanley advised Red Hat.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Who Is Neri Oxman?", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bydomainsA star of M.I.T.\u2019s Media Lab working in \u201cmaterial ecology,\u201d she has intrigued Bj\u00f6rk, Brad Pitt and the Cooper Hewitt.CAMBRIDGE, Mass. \u2014 One hot day in early September, Neri Oxman, a tenured professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\u2019s Media Lab, was on her way to lunch when it hit her. \u201c\u2018Form follows pheromones!\u2019\u201d she remembered exclaiming. \u201cI was thinking, as I was devouring my meatball sandwich, about how we could use robotic arms to spit out pheromones guiding bees to template honeycombs in the absence of queens. The robots, you see, could master the hive.\u201d\u201cWe are sending bees to outer space,\u201d she added, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a little cell on Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin mission.\u201d (Mr. Bezos has his eye on a lunar landing.) Bees, I learned later, use pheromones to communicate, a complex endocrine language through which the queen, for example, tells her subjects to step up their work on the honeycomb. Hence Dr. Oxman\u2019s aper\u00e7u.Her team can do crazy things with moss, mushrooms and apple pectin. They are outliers even for the Media Lab, a playground of cutting-edge technology with a social conscience. Dr. Oxman and her students are an eclectic bunch: a biomedical engineer, a glass blower, a material scientist, a computer scientist whose specialty is wet artificial intelligence (which has something to do with programming bacteria), an architect, a marine biologist and, yes, a beekeeper, among other specialists. Dr. Oxman likes to play Noah with would-be applicants. \u201cYou have to have two of everything, so they can procreate intellectually if not biologically,\u201d she said. (There have been material ecology love affairs, five marriages and three babies.) The team has been collaborating, as they say, with natural organisms like slime molds, monarchs and silkworms, to make extraordinary objects and structures that do all sorts of extraordinary things.Glistening sheets of a honey-colored material were made from a paste of ground-up shrimp shells that varies from opaque to translucent and is embedded with bacteria that has been engineered to capture carbon and turn it into sugar. The stuff also biodegrades on command.\u201cWe treat design more like a gardening practice,\u201d Dr. Oxman said.Preternaturally beautiful, these startling-looking objects have appeared on fashion runways and design fairs, and live in the permanent collections of museums of both art and science, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian. And they have made Dr. Oxman, who is rather startling looking herself, a star.Ms. Lam, the software designer, described Dr. Oxman as a contemporary Leonardo da Vinci. John Maeda, the head of computational design at Automattic, a web development company, who also was once an M.I.T. Media Lab darling, said, \u201cIf I was the Terminator, Neri is Terminator 2. I was crappy titanium parts, but she\u2019s like liquid metal.\u201dWhat makes Dr. Oxman, the scientist, so unusual, said Paola Antonelli, the senior curator of architecture and design at MoMA, is her aesthetic sense. \u201cShe\u2019s not afraid of formal elegance,\u201d Ms. Antonelli said. \u201cThe reason why she is a gift to the field of architecture and design is that her science works, her aesthetics work, and her theory works. It\u2019s been interesting to see scientists respond. They welcome the collaboration because they know the research they develop with her team is going to be accepted by their peers and it might even show up in a museum. That it might be beautiful. I\u2019m not afraid to use that word, by the way.\u201dDr. Oxman is on sabbatical this year, but she was in the lab this sweltering day to explain her practice, gulping green tea and gently chastising me for a Diet Coke habit. \u201cI used to be a Coke enthusiast,\u201d she said, \u201cbut now I\u2019m addicted to E. coli.\u201d That bacteria, she said, is known as the workhorse of synthetic biology, which basically means you can make it do anything. Charismatic and epigrammatic, Dr. Oxman speaks as if in capital letters and long, enticing, musical paragraphs.\u201cWhat does it mean to design a living object?\u201d she said. \u201cHow do we accommodate for dimensional mismatches between environmental constraints, light, load, da, da, da and the material? How can you have a single material system that is multifunctional, that is not made of parts and that can vary over space and time for different conditions? Can you make architecture that behaves like a tree.\u201d \u201cI sang a song called \u2018Quicksand,\u2019 which is about a nihilist goth-like person,\u201d Bj\u00f6rk wrote in her email, \u201cso we aimed for biological goth. I remember looking at Mexican death masks but mostly talking about love, to be honest.\u201dTo remind, Mr. Pitt\u2019s interests include architecture, furniture design and urban planning. Dr. Oxman described him \u201cas the last of the Mohicans in post-Netflix Hollywood. He brings together the timely and the timeless,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is what cinema is all about.\u201d (Dr. Oxman is a Fellini and Ingmar Bergman fan.) She also had some fun with the paparazzi staked out in front of the Media Lab. As she left work during that Pitt period, she made sure to brandish a copy of the Feynman Lectures (a famous physics textbook) and of the Golden Record, the audio time capsule (in the form of an LP, otherwise known as an album or record) that went to Mars in 1977, in a subversive plug for Team Science.\u201cThe Golden Record beats the Caviar quilted flap bag on any given day,\u201d she said. \u201cToting the ultimate message to moon was my message in a bottle to the paparazzi. The Feynman Lectures followed.\u201dA \u201ccoy\u201d piano player who was a first lieutenant in the Israeli air force, Dr. Oxman dropped out of medical school to pursue architecture, and then earned her Ph.D. in design computation at M.I.T. Her heroes are Leonard Bernstein, Buckminster Fuller and her grandmother Miriam, a Sabra, an educator and a gardener.Her parents, both professors, are architectural royalty in Israel. Her father, Robert Oxman, is a theory guy. Her mother, Rivka Oxman, was an early pioneer and booster of artificial intelligence in architectural design.Dr. Oxman is spending part of her sabbatical working on a project for Ms. Antonelli, who is curating the XXII Triennale di Milano international exhibition next March. The theme is \u201cBroken Nature,\u201d an appropriately thorny topic for the times.In response, Dr. Oxman and her group have been experimenting with melanin, the natural pigment found in all six of what biologists call \u201cthe kingdoms of life\u201d (plants, minerals, animals, bacteria and fungi); melanin is also a biomarker of evolution because it has been around since the time of the dinosaurs. What does it mean to engineer melanin? There are obvious boons for tissue repair and sun protection, but what are the implications, she continued, \u201cphilosophically, practically, ethically, humanely, socially and anthropologically for doing such a thing? Up until now, our work has been culturally agnostic. This project takes us further into charged territories.\u201dPractically speaking, she said, her group is imagining a \u201cbiological building,\u201d for Ms. Antonelli\u2019s show. \u201cCould it act as structure and skin, varying its concentration as a function of a site-specific sun path diagram?\u201dIt is Dr. Oxman\u2019s grand ambition, said Moshe Safdie, the Israeli-Canadian architect and urban planner who is a friend and mentor, \u201cto transform the methodology of building. Today we have materials that are translucent and we have materials that are load bearing and she is hoping we would reach the day when we have materials that could behave in multiple ways. Release light and store energy. \u201c\u201cIt is such a grand ambition, I don\u2019t think it will be fulfilled in my life,\u201d said Mr. Safdie, now 80. \u201cI might be wrong.\u201d\u201cBecause she is a gifted artist,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhat comes out through whatever processes she uses are beautiful objects. People are fascinated by these lovely objects. From my perspective, from a wish that her grand ambitions are fulfilled, this is like a sideshow, but it\u2019s a sideshow that gets a lot of attention.\u201dDr. Oxman would adamantly agree.\u201cLook, we haven\u2019t gone this far to sell glass-printed light fixtures on Amazon,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are here and remain committed because we are able to design an architectural \u2018skin\u2019 as an optical lens, thereby opening up possibilities for harnessing solar energy on urban scales. These technologies should not be trivialized for entertainment purposes alone, though potentially profitable solutions such as a biodegradable Pellegrino bottle may well help us cut out plastic. One has to start somewhere without compromising soul.\u201dWhen the lab figured out how to 3-D-print glass, which has all sorts of applications for building facades, Dr. Oxman was wooed by a Chinese billionaire in the fragrance business. \u201cHe said, I\u2019ll give you this amount of millions of dollars if you can produce perfume diffusers by Christmas,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI thought, I\u2019ll take your money, but you won\u2019t see any perfume diffusers. The challenge for me is to scale while maintaining ideological purity. It would be to easy to start a line of melanin makeup. Easy! Vitamin-infused melanin for sun-protection-slash-makeup. Easy! That\u2019s a billion-dollar industry. But why not have an architect enter the race to cure cancer?\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Danger of Running an Election on Fear", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Politics With Lisa LererHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.Some elections are about hope. Some elections are about change. And some elections are about fear.I started the day watching the sun rise over the ocean in Miami, thinking that\u2019s what I\u2019d write you all today \u2014 how candidates from both sides had turned to scare tactics in the final weeks of the election.Well, it turns out that if you stoke enough fake fears, they can become real.While officials haven\u2019t yet announced a suspect or motive, all of the intended recipients are favorite targets of right-wing politicians and media.But they\u2019ve also created a political climate with such heightened rhetoric that, for people exposed to the constant drumbeat of fear, real danger can feel like an inevitable outcome.Voters have spent months hearing about imagined threats \u2014 a caravan of criminals about to storm the border, the total demise of government, riots over immigration and an epidemic of false sexual assault allegations.I\u2019ve seen some of it myself during my trip to Florida this week.Ron DeSantis, the Republican candidate for governor, stood alongside a group of sheriffs on Tuesday and warned that the migrant caravan moving north through Central America is \u201ceffectively a wet kiss to the drug cartels.\u201d\u201cThe caravan can\u2019t just be allowed to overrun our border,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you see that developing, obviously that is orchestrated.\u201dBut Democrats haven\u2019t been mincing their words in response. In fact, as Election Day has neared, they\u2019ve grown more aggressive in their remarks, too.On Monday, former Vice President Joe Biden campaigned across the state with Andrew Gillum and Senator Bill Nelson, warning that the country was in a \u201cbattle for America\u2019s soul\u201d from a president who was \u201cshredding American values.\u201d\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, pick your heads up,\u201d he told a crowd in Jacksonville. \u201cTake this country back.\u201dAt a fund-raiser in Coral Gables this afternoon, Mrs. Clinton addressed the news of the bombs.\u201cIt\u2019s a time of deep divisions, and we have to do everything we can to bring our country together,\u201d she told a crowd of 200 donors.But it\u2019s worth noting how she talked about this election just 15 days ago.\u201cYou cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for, what you care about,\u201d she told CNN.Obviously, there\u2019s a difference between political protests and actual violence. But as politicians in this heated election encourage their supporters to fear the other side, it\u2019s not hard to imagine that for some, that line can start to look a little bit blurry.____________________\u201cBe cool!\u201d one of the Democratic activists completely failed to whisper to another.So began Tuesday evening at a suburban Atlanta phone bank, as Michelle Kwan, the most decorated American figure skater in history, arrived to dial for Georgia\u2019s energized Democrats, including Stacey Abrams, the nominee for governor.It was, Ms. Kwan suggested in a room filled with smartphones, a reliable old-school fix for a riddle of every campaign: how to stir voters to actually vote.\u201cThere are some people who think, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s got it in the bag,\u2019 or, \u2018My voice doesn\u2019t count,\u2019 and it really matters,\u201d Ms. Kwan, who worked for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 2016, said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s why those people who are here making phone calls, they might not feel like they reach a lot of people. They might have a canvass packet with 75 people, and they might talk to 30.

{"Headline": "With Bugs, You\u2019re Never Home Alone", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA citizen-science project aims to catalog the spiders, insects and other many-legged creatures that live indoors with us.\u201cStart with your windowsills,\u201d advises Rob Dunn. \u201cLight fittings are often a graveyard, too.\u201d In the world\u2019s densest cities, the indoor biome is bigger than the outdoor space, at least in terms of floor area. (Indoor Manhattan, Dr. Dunn calculates, now exceeds outdoor Manhattan by a factor of three to one.) Yet scientists know almost nothing about the spiders and flies and booklice that inhabit this space alongside us. Even Dr. Dunn was, until recently, guilty of ignoring his six-legged housemates. A few years ago, he and his colleagues decided to take a census of fifty homes in Raleigh, N.C., including his own. \u201cI would have told you I had four species of spiders,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWhen we looked, we found ten in my house \u2014 and that turns out to be the average.\u201d Indeed, some houses in Raleigh had more than two hundred arthropod species in total; Dr. Dunn and his team have found a similar multiplicity of bugs living in homes as far afield as Sweden and Peru.At the same time, the extent of this ignorance was overwhelming. It took the team hours to survey a single home, and even longer to identify each specimen. At that pace, Dr. Dunn would never have enough data to understand even the basic patterns of indoor insect life, or how they differed throughout the United States, let alone the world. iNaturalist \u2014 a citizen-science app with users across the globe, and the ability to geolocate and even identify specimens from photos using A.I. \u2014 offered a way through this bottleneck.In July, Dr. Dunn created a page for the project, and began asking the platform\u2019s most active users to contribute. By mid-October, the project page had received more than 3,000 submissions, representing more than 800 species, from more than 1,000 participants around the world. Already there are surprises. Take booklice: tiny light-brown bugs with fat abdomens and bulging eyes, they are neither lice nor restricted to books. They feed on starch, including the starch in bookbinding glue, but typically prefer the higher humidity of a kitchen or bathroom. \u201cIf you were to ask any of us about booklice before this project, we would have said, sure, we\u2019ll probably find some,\u201d said Dr. Dunn. \u201cSo far, we\u2019ve found them in one hundred percent of houses.\u201dGood news: You\u2019re never home alone. Meet your microscopic roommates and hairy houseguests up close and personal in bug-tastic augmented reality.\u201cPeople who live in tropical Asia clearly know this is in their houses, but it wasn\u2019t known by scientists more generally,\u201d Dr. Dunn said. One of the first things Dr. Dunn wants to do once he reaches 10,000 sightings is analyze how all these species are distributed globally. In Raleigh, the houses he surveyed were populated with bugs that originated in the Fertile Crescent and came to the Americas with European colonists. By that logic, Dr. Dunn would expect many of the indoor insects in New Zealand to be British. But that assumption may be wrong. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a whole bunch of Kiwis that have been super keen on this project,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it turns out that there are all these endemic New Zealand indoor species, like the Wellington house spider, that I\u2019ve never heard of.\u201dOther patterns are emerging, logical but intriguing nonetheless. Households with pets harbor more insect diversity; so do homes where the windows are open more often. Different bugs favor different rooms \u2014 a preference that, in some cases, seems to have been fixed for millenniums: beetle and fly remains have been used to differentiate between bathrooms and kitchens in archaeological sites from ancient Egypt to England. It\u2019s entirely possible that certain architectural styles or floor plans favor particular insect communities, but researchers know too little to even formulate those kinds of hypotheses.In a survey, scientists found many travelers could not distinguish bedbugs from other pests, which could have implications for hotels and the travel industry.For a bug-loving scientist who wants to understand the forces shaping life\u2019s diversity in one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing ecosystems, the thrill of the Never Home Alone project is obvious. But for home dwellers who are more inclined to swat a fly than admire its iridescent coloring, what\u2019s the upside? Dr. Dunn bristled at the question, before gamely pointing out that many of these species are, or could be, extremely useful. \u201cIn tropical Asia, there\u2019s a jumping spider that\u2019s common in houses, and it preferentially feeds on dengue-infected mosquitoes,\u201d he said. Spiders, on the whole, are beneficial: they feed on less pleasant insects such as roaches, earwigs, flies and clothes moths, and they rarely bite. \u201cIn my lab, we all love spiders, but, in general, I would say our attitude about these species in our houses is misdirected,\u201d said Dr. Dunn.Effecting this attitude adjustment is perhaps the most ambitious goal of the Never Home Alone project. \u201cAlready, we\u2019ve made connections with people we could never have reached before,\u201d Dr. Dunn said. He reached out to Zain Al-najm, an art student and iNaturalist contributor in Basra, Iraq, who uploaded a photo of a long-legged, thin-bodied Enicospilus wasp, its exact species unknown \u2014 the only observation on the website from this family of bugs in the entire Middle East. \u201cThat was my most interesting insect,\u201d Mr. Al-najm said in an email. \u201cBut where we live are a lot of creatures that we do not care about but are really amazing.\u201d\u201cIf you find a fly in your house, it could be a house fly,\u201d Mr. Dankowicz said. \u201cBut just as often it\u2019s, like, a flesh fly, a bottle fly or a cluster fly, and those are really great and interesting species that you should know about.\u201dDr. Dunn accepts that most of us will never embrace the insects in our homes with great enthusiasm; he is striving merely for tolerance and, if possible, a little wonder. \u201cSome of these species are super cool,\u201d he said, describing a spider that kills its prey by spitting on it. (The spit is ejected from repurposed silk glands at speeds of nearly 100 feet per second). But even without our good will, our insect housemates will be there; our homes, with their mild and constant climate, not to mention huge quantities of food and water, present a welcoming environment for life at all scales. \u201cThe best we can do is hope to sway that population to species that benefit us, rather than do us harm,\u201d said Dr. Dunn. \u201cBut first we have to understand who\u2019s there.\u201d So, this Halloween, peek into those dark corners; look behind your toilet and under your bed. Resist the reflex to squash \u2014 or blowtorch \u2014 whatever you see, and take a photo instead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Need a Handbag or a Tie to Land Your First Job? Borrow One With a Library Card", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn the second floor of the New York Public Library\u2019s Riverside branch last week, a handful of high school students were eager to hear Michelle Lee, a young adult librarian there, discuss tricks for finding employment.\u201cWho has a job?\u201d Ms. Lee asked. (No hands went up.)\u201cWho wants a job?\u201d she continued. (All hands went up.)For the next hour and a half, as some students munched on snacks, Ms. Lee covered the dos and don\u2019ts of interviewing and offered tips on how to produce a strong r\u00e9sum\u00e9, even using fictitious examples for Peter Parker and Kamala Khan to illustrate her point.And off to one side of the room were the most unusual new additions to the library\u2019s collection: neutral-colored handbags and briefcases, and purple, blue and striped neckties, all of which can be checked out like books for up to three weeks.The staff at the Riverside branch, on the Upper West Side, started a new lending program in August after Ms. Lee proposed it, one of several programs meant to help jump-start the professional careers of young adults. As news of the program has trickled out through outreach and news coverage, members of the community have offered their own items for lending.Ms. Lee said she got the idea during one of her twice-yearly job hunt talks for teenagers. When she spoke about how it was important that they wear their best outfit for interviews, one attendee said he didn\u2019t have one.She said she began to think of ways to help him, and had an idea. Lending accessories like handbags and ties, she thought, would help those who cannot necessarily afford to buy them and offer an extra dose of confidence.The program adds to the New York Public Library\u2019s list of services for young adults, which includes a referral system at the Grand Central Library to an organization that offers business attire, Ms. Lee said. Staff members at some libraries are trained as advisers to offer help. At the Riverside branch, employees host college essay workshops and SAT practice sessions.On Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Lee held her second job talk of the year. She intentionally scheduled it just before the holiday season, when retail businesses are looking for extra hands.She used her own outfit \u2014 a simple black dress and white blazer \u2014 as an example of business casual. She then pointed out the table where the new items sat, and told the students that they could check out two at a time, but that they would have to pay if they lost an item. The bags, which she bought from Amazon, range in price from $40 to $121, and ties are $25 to replace.Sonobia James, 16, sat in the back row with friends. She said she attended the presentation because she had tried looking for a job before, to no avail. \u201cI thought this was a good opportunity, because maybe I did something wrong,\u201d she said.She learned about the lending program through the talk, and said she would consider checking out a black handbag \u201cwhen the time comes\u201d to interview for jobs.\u201cI always put things in my pockets,\u201d she said, a habit that leads to her losing belongings. \u201cA handbag could be useful.\u201dThe program, while part of a larger project aimed at young adults, can be used by anyone, Ms. Lee said. She has had high school students and adults check out items since the pilot program began.Angela Himmelberg, a senior at Pace University, said she heard about the program from her mother. Ms. Himmelberg, 21, was preparing for a multiday conference for young entrepreneurs hosted by Forbes in Boston, but as a college student without a disposable income, she said it was hard to invest in quality accessories.On the day before her trip, Ms. Himmelberg found herself browsing a catalog of items at the library, and within a few minutes had checked out a black handbag that she took with her to Boston.Instead of lugging around her school backpack, she said she felt at ease with the purse that completed her look. \u201cIt made me feel more confident,\u201d Ms. Himmelberg said in a phone interview. \u201cIt just made me feel more professional.\u201dBecause it is a pilot program, there are no plans to expand it to other libraries, Ms. Lee said, but the need for it has been clear.\u201cI\u2019m just hoping that more people come in and use it,\u201d she said, \u201cand that this hopefully gets them started on their career, first job or first internship.\u201dAdvertisement"}

But men are now being seen as more risky hires.\u201dBut the analysis shows that the #MeToo movement shook, and is still shaking, power structures in society\u2019s most visible sectors. The Times gathered cases of prominent people who lost their main jobs, significant leadership positions or major contracts, and whose ousters were publicly covered in news reports.Forty-three percent of their replacements were women. Of those, one-third are in news media, one-quarter in government, and one-fifth in entertainment and the arts. For example, Robin Wright replaced Kevin Spacey as lead actor on \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d Emily Nemens replaced Lorin Stein as editor of \u201cThe Paris Review,\u201d and Tina Smith replaced Al Franken as a senator from Minnesota.People Replacing Men Accused of Sexual MisconductWomen are starting to gain power in organizations that have been jolted by harassment, with potentially far-reaching effects.\u201cI find it so interesting the number of people who come up to me and say, \u2018Thank you for stepping in when someone needed to step in,\u2019\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of what women do a lot of the time, right?\u201dThat has been true in Congress, said Ms. Smith, a Democrat. In a highly polarized Senate, women tend to be unusually collegial across party lines, she said, and the 23 female senators meet for dinner monthly.U.S. senator for MinnesotaResigned after accusations of groping and improper advances from at least six women. He apologized but denied many of the allegations.Interim\u201cI believe you\u2019re successful and you get things done if you have relationships with people,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the ground for accomplishing something, certainly in the legislative world.\u201dOne example: She and Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican from Alaska, discovered that they both worked on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in high school. The bond they built from shared experience helped them when they co-sponsored mental health legislation that was included in the opioid crisis response bill passed last month.In news media and entertainment, many women who ascended to jobs vacated by men have changed the tone and substance of what they offer audiences \u2014 and in some cases, the fallout from #MeToo has shaped their decisions.Head of Amazon StudiosResigned after a Hollywood producer accused him of making unwanted sexual advances.InterimPermanentSince Tanzina Vega took over from John Hockenberry as host of \u201cThe Takeaway,\u201d the public radio program, she has done many episodes about gender, including on masculinity, women\u2019s anger and the intersection of gender and race \u2014 topics that she had been covering for years but that she said were now part of the national conversation.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily because I\u2019m a woman, but it\u2019s just that as a woman, as a Latina, I know when the conversation hasn\u2019t been about women, and I\u2019m deeply sensitive to that,\u201d said Ms. Vega, who was previously a reporter at CNN and The New York Times.Host of WNYC\u2019s \u201cThe Takeaway\u201dAfter he left \u201cThe Takeaway,\u201d nine women accused Mr. Hockenberry of sexual harassment, including unwelcome sexual advances. He apologized, describing his behavior as \u201crude, aggressive and impolite.\u201dInterimPermanentFriday hostWomen\u2019s personal experiences, including as mothers, can make workplaces more welcoming to other women. That\u2019s the hope of Christine Tsai, who is chief executive of the tech investment firm 500 Startups, where she replaced Dave McClure in early 2017 after an internal investigation into his behavior toward women in the tech community.\u201cI\u2019ve erred on the side as C.E.O. of being more open about it, like if one of my kids has an appointment, so hopefully it creates an environment where people don\u2019t feel like they have to hide that they have obligations to family,\u201d she said. \u201cSure, a guy can be sensitive to those things, but I think it helps having that empathy of what it\u2019s like for moms.\u201dThe women who have risen, however, can only make so much change \u2014 they are still operating in a male-dominated system. More than 10 percent of the ousted men have tried to make a comeback, or voiced a desire to, and many never lost financial power.When people accused of harassment return to power without making amends \u2014 or never lose it, at least financially \u2014 it limits the post-Weinstein movement\u2019s potential to change how power is exercised in American society.\u201cWhere\u2019s the self-reflection and accountability?\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps if we saw some evidence of that, then we can have a more robust conversation about the road to redemption.\u201dIn the meantime, these women say, there are more than enough qualified women ready to take their places in power.\u201cA bunch of us who took over these jobs got promoted because we were really good at these jobs,\u201d said Ms. Vega, the radio host. \u201cWe have the skills, we have the experience, we have the work ethic and we have the smarts to do it, and it\u2019s time for us to do this job.\u201dThe 98 Men Who Were ReplacedOf the men who lost their jobs, 51 have been replaced by at least one woman in an interim or permanent capacity.

{"Headline": "Sears\u2019s Edward Lampert Was a Wizard. Now He\u2019s Coming to Terms With Failure.", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBy age 25, Edward S. Lampert was already a Wall Street wunderkind, celebrated for his intellect, ambition and prodigious work ethic. The famed investor Richard Rainwater, the billionaire Hollywood mogul David Geffen, and Michael Dell and Thomas J. Tisch were among the prominent backers who gave him more than $200 million in start-up capital.If that was his intent, it was a singularly inept effort. Mr. Lampert\u2019s steadfast \u2014 many would say stubborn \u2014 commitment to Sears has cost him billions in personal wealth, not to mention the damage to his reputation. Nearly all of his early investors have abandoned him. His hedge fund\u2019s assets have dwindled. Last year, one of his staunchest backers, the hedge fund manager Bruce Berkowitz, bailed out, saying that Sears had \u201cwrecked\u201d his hedge fund\u2019s returns. The decline of Sears \u201chas been hugely frustrating and fatiguing for me to watch,\u201d Mr. Berkowitz told his investors.\u201cI\u2019ve taken a huge personal hit,\u201d Mr. Lampert told me this week in a wide-ranging interview, his first since the bankruptcy filing. \u201cNot just in money, but time. There\u2019s been an enormous opportunity cost.\u201dThere was widespread skepticism when Mr. Lampert first merged two once-popular but struggling retailers in 2005. On one flank was the mighty Walmart. On the other was the fast-growing Amazon. Sears lacked Walmart\u2019s economies of scale and Amazon\u2019s digital reach. But Mr. Lampert knew that great fortunes aren\u2019t made by following conventional wisdom.\u201cBeing a contrarian, being an independent thinker has never bothered me,\u201d Mr. Lampert said. \u201cI knew it was going to be hard no matter what. But I was trying to be opportunistic. I was willing to make a very big bet in money and time.\u201d He pointed out that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, is now the richest person in the world, and Sam Walton, the Walmart patriarch, was the richest American in his day. \u201cThey both took advantage of an opportunity.\u201dThe opportunity that Mr. Lampert, but few others, saw was the combination of Sears\u2019s brands and customer loyalty and Kmart\u2019s attractive real estate, most of it in prime stand-alone locations rather than within aging malls. That promise seemed to be borne out in the early years. But the financial crisis and the collapse of the housing market hit Sears\u2019s appliance and housewares sales. Sears never regained momentum.By 2009, Mr. Lampert told me, he realized that nothing less than a radical transformation of Sears\u2019s culture would allow it to keep up with the digital revolution that was transforming the retail industry. That year, he launched the store\u2019s ShopYourWay campaign as the cornerstone of a new data-driven and customer-focused strategy to compete with Amazon.That\u2019s where Mr. Lampert met his match. He said he didn\u2019t pick the best executives to fully embrace the company\u2019s digital makeover. \u201cI underestimated how difficult it is to do and how critical are the right people to lead and to get people to buy in,\u201d he said.As one example, he cited his attempt to convert underutilized space into internet lounges, which offered customers free Wi-Fi and a place to relax. It was an attempt to get customers, many of whom didn\u2019t have internet access at home at the time, into stores, much as Starbucks had attracted laptop-toting coffee drinkers.This was anathema to traditional retailers, who measured success strictly in terms of sales per square foot and for whom any space not dedicated to merchandise was a waste. Nonetheless, the computer-equipped internet lounges were rolled out in 100 Sears locations \u2014 but in a halfhearted manner. \u201cI\u2019d visit a store, and there\u2019d be 10 computers,\u201d Mr. Lampert recalled. \u201cHalf of them wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d The lounges were abandoned. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have store leaders or a C.E.O. at the time who embraced the idea,\u201d Mr. Lampert said.In 2013 Mr. Lampert himself became chief executive, something he said he had never aspired to. He expected to stay in the role only a few months. \u201cI wanted to be an idea generator,\u201d he said. \u201cI was trying to be a catalyst, not the operating person.\u201dBy then it was too late. Caught in a spiral of declining sales, huge losses, store closings, forced asset sales and relentless competition from online rivals, Sears struggled for its day-to-day existence, a war of attrition that ended with this week\u2019s bankruptcy.It\u2019s far from clear that successful internet lounges, or even an agile culture that embraced change, would have saved Sears. Mr. Lampert has reaped criticism for underinvesting in Sears\u2019s physical stores; for trying to run the company from his Florida office, far from the company\u2019s Hoffman Estates, Ill., headquarters; and for a revolving door in the executive suites. In the end, though, none of that may have mattered much, either.\u201cI had a vision and a passion, but I never thought of myself as the only person who could save it,\u201d he said. \u201cI may have been the only person who tried to save it.\u201d He noted that no one ever approached him about buying Sears, even at a bargain price. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t lost on me that other people didn\u2019t think it was possible.\u201dMr. Lampert insisted to me that ShopYourWay was showing promise but required far more time and capital than Sears could muster. \u201cIf I could have raised billions, I could have done things differently,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to incubate ideas requires a huge investment.\u201dMr. Lampert added: \u201cI\u2019m not fine with the outcome, but I\u2019m fine with the effort. I\u2019ve never worked harder or stretched further beyond my limits.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flavor Is a Language, and Like Wine, Candy Has Its Own", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "I learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple.

Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924.

Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties.

The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making.

Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTrade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times.

At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum.

Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I.

Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within.

{"Headline": "What Comes After the Roomba?", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 It has been 16 years since the Roomba robot vacuum cleaner was introduced by iRobot.Partly inspired by a novel robotics approach known as \u201cfast, cheap and out-of-control,\u201d the humble Roomba was not much of a robot. It simply wandered around a room sucking up dust and debris. A second generation was able to autonomously make its way back to a recharging station.But unlike robots like Sony\u2019s dog, Aibo, it did something useful at a nonastronomical price. It was a hit for iRobot, a spinoff from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Since then, there have been waves of failed attempts to create more sophisticated home robotic products from companies in the United States, Japan, South Korea and Europe. There have been efforts to build humanoid robots, social companion robots, robots that cook, robots that do your dry cleaning, robots that fold your clothes and robots that change the kitty litter.But there still isn\u2019t a second successful home robot category beyond the lowly vacuum cleaner.Despite persistent optimism, roboticists and A.I. researchers have painfully learned that while computers can run mathematical circles around humans, things that humans do without thinking are the most difficult for machines. John McCarthy, an A.I. pioneer, would reach into his pocket and deftly extract a quarter as an example of the most challenging tasks for a robot.Many researchers have come to believe that the recent breakthroughs in machine learning will not be enough to build robots adept at moving and performing tasks in a home. That is likely to require several more technological breakthroughs.The continuing challenges in building a successful home robot have been underscored recently by the disappointments of several high-profile start-ups.Mayfield Robotics, which was developing Kuri, a home companion robot with backing from Robert Bosch G.m.b.H., a German electronics company, announced in July that it was \u201cpausing\u201d operations and returning pre-order deposits. Kuri\u2019s demise followed a similar fate earlier this year that befell Jibo, a heavily funded effort by Cynthia Breazeal, an M.I.T. professor, to build a social robot that had started a $3.5 million Indiegogo campaign in 2014.Pepper, introduced as a home robot by the French robot design firm Aldebaran Robotics and then acquired by SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate, was initially priced at $2,000 with an additional monthly subscription. The robot is now being advertised on the firm\u2019s website as a commercial \u201chost\u201d or greeter for a flat fee of $25,000.The snail\u2019s pace of development in home robots stands in striking contrast to the rapid advance of artificial intelligence in successful products like Amazon\u2019s Echo or even the Siri technology of iPhones.\u201cNot a single human has been replaced by a humanoid robot,\u201d said Sebastian Thrun, the roboticist who started Google\u2019s self-driving car program.Japan and South Korea have been ahead of the United States in their enthusiasm for home robots, but companies there have had similarly disappointing results.\u201cAt one point I remember the president of South Korea saying that there would be robots in most Korea homes by 2012,\u201d said Tandy Trower, a software engineer who oversaw the original Microsoft Windows operating system and later established a robotics development effort at the company.He now leads his own home robot company, Hoaloha Robotics, which is focused on a mobile robot to permit older people to live independently at home. Mr. Trower said that while he remained optimistic that in the long run he would be able to develop a robot that acted as a partner or an assistant for aging people, he realized that a commercial product was not on the near horizon.Despite those repeated failures, many technologists remain optimistic that the home robot is just around the corner.At Stanford University, which pioneered the original robot arm and first mobile robot in the 1960s, the roboticist Kenneth Salisbury developed the prototype PR1 home robot a decade ago.The PR1 inspired Willow Garage, a start-up funded by Scott Hassan, one of Google\u2019s original programmers. Willow Garage produced another prototype home robot, the PR2, which led to a number of spinoffs, but no successful commercial home applications emerged from the research.Both the PR1 and PR2 were early explorations in performing common household tasks like getting a cup of coffee, loading and unloading the dishwasher, and going to the refrigerator and getting a beer. The robot prototypes performed these tasks, but only in highly controlled experiments.Now, Stanford roboticists are working on a next-generation robot that could potentially work in the home. Silvio Savarese, a Stanford computer scientist, is leading a team developing a robot called JackRabbot, intended for home or campus delivery as well as some tasks in the home. But getting around a house is still difficult, even in a ranch house without stairs, he said.Self-driving cars\u2019 engineers use the technology \u201csimultaneous localization and mapping,\u201d or SLAM, to navigate. It makes it possible to create a map in an unknown environment and place the car accurately. But in a home, with densely packed objects, including humans, that move frequently, SLAM is insufficient, Mr. Savarese said.So could a robot that helps tidy up the house be close?\u201cPicking things off the floor is with in reach if we can get the price of the arm down,\u201d said Ken Goldberg, a roboticist at Berkeley. His favorite for a new market might be what he calls a \u201cdecluttering robot,\u201d which would wander the house picking up after its occupants.\u201cDoing anything time critical is difficult,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201c But if you are willing to leave the house and come back six hours later \u2014 the house is clean.\u201dHis group is also experimenting with a robot that can make a bed \u2014 admittedly slowly, but he argues that it is not a task that has to be done at human speed.The Berkeley researchers are doing their experiments using a robot supplied by the Toyota Research Institute. The automaker is one of at least three large technology companies that have active home robot development projects in Silicon Valley.Many roboticists say they believe that the aging of people around the globe will be the catalyst for the arrival of more sophisticated home robots.\u201cThe demographic shifts of aging society will provide, in our view, a strong opportunity for a market for such a product to start, and that we also expect that what is good for aging society will also end up being helpful for everyone,\u201d said Gill Pratt, the chief executive of the Toyota Research Institute.In addition to Toyota, Alphabet\u2019s Google X research laboratory and Amazon have active robotics research efforts that are reportedly aimed at home applications.Despite the new investments in research and development, veteran researchers are conscious that home robots have seemed imminent for decades.\u201cThe problem,\u201d said Kai-Fu Lee, a leading Chinese artificial intelligence researcher who is now a venture investor, \u201cis that low cost plus high expectations plus no patience makes it difficult to make a great product.\u201dAn earlier version of this article and a picture caption misstated the name of a robot being developed at Stanford. It is JackRabbot, not Jackrobbot.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Sears May Be on the Brink of Bankruptcy", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThis isn\u2019t surprising. Sears has lost $11 billion since 2011; sales have dropped 60 percent over the same period; and it has closed hundreds of stores. Its C.E.O., Eddie Lampert, has sold off businesses to raise cash, but critics argue that he has strip-mined the company.Filing for bankruptcy is risky for retailers, as doing so tends to send customers and suppliers fleeing, making it hard to recover. There\u2019s no reason to think Sears would fare any differently.That is a huge bet to place on a company with enormous growth, huge ambitions \u2014 and widening losses.Beijing is running out of options in the trade war. One extreme action it could take, as the holder of over $1 trillion in U.S. foreign debt, would be to buy back that debt \u2014 or even to dump it on the open market. Experts tend to dismiss that possibility, as it would severely damage both the American and Chinese economies.There is no proving ground. There is no predictable math, no scale model. If China were to use its nuclear option and the markets didn\u2019t react, it would lose influence in stark fashion. If it worked \u2014 but was more effective than expected \u2014 China could inflict unintended damage on its own economy. And even a perfectly executed strike that left China unharmed would be perilous: A targeted attack on the United States economy would have unknowable repercussions. If the fallout cloud settled over Europe or emerging markets, would China be ready for that fight, too?Beijing\u2019s latest effort to prop up its economy amid a trade war with the U.S. isn\u2019t working yet. China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, fell again this week, to below 6.93 per dollar.But the currency doesn\u2019t trade freely: It moves within a range set by the central bank. And a fall in its value can make Chinese exports cheaper for foreign buyers, which is handy when President Trump\u2019s tariffs push up their prices in America.Among the sectors hardest hit by Mr. Trump\u2019s approach are the beverage and auto industries, which rely heavily on foreign aluminum and steel to make cans and cars. PepsiCo, the drinks and snacks company, said this month that higher prices for aluminum imports from Canada were eating into quarterly profits and said it would raise prices as a result. The company lowered its profit forecast for the year and its stock slid. Similarly, the chief executive of Ford Motor Company said last month that the additional costs from the metal tariffs alone would shave about $1 billion off its annual profits.The new trade deal won\u2019t be signed until late November, and it could be amended before then. Some Republican lawmakers have been pushing Mr. Trump to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs. That may happen \u2014 or the whole thing could be thrown into limbo if Democrats take back the House.The uncertainty in insider trading law invites debate over the legality of misconduct that has no place in our markets. But this is a fixable problem: The law can be updated and made clearer. Ideally, Congress would take the lead. But bipartisan proposals to update the law have languished for years. The S.E.C., however, does have the authority to clarify insider trading law. The commission should use that authority before the next wave of corporate abuses.Mr. Bharara has set up a task force to study the issue and come up with concrete solutions. Then he just needs to persuade Congress to take them up.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading! We\u2019ll see you tomorrow.Advertisement"}

Her debut novel, \u201cFruit of the Drunken Tree,\u201d was published this summer.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home.

She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day.

Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTrade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D.

So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times.

{"Headline": "In Battle With Amazon, Walmart Pushes Deeper Into Entertainment", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalmart is going Hollywood.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has agreed to create short-form original series for Walmart\u2019s ad-supported streaming service, Vudu. Those are expected to debut early next year. It is the first of many studios that Walmart expects to work with in creating new content for Vudu, a spokesman for the retailer said Wednesday.Walmart is also investing in a joint venture with Eko, a New York start-up that focuses on \u201cinteractive storytelling,\u201d a video format that allows viewers to control the plot of commercials and television episodes.The investment with Eko totals $250 million, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the deal. It is thought to be the largest bet on the interactive entertainment niche, which has long tantalized producers as a potential gold mine but has never gained widespread adoption.\u201cWe are not trying to become a studio,\u201d said Scott McCall, a senior vice president for entertainment, toys and seasonal at Walmart. \u201cIt is our hope that we will work with studios to reimagine what new content looks like.\u201dWalmart\u2019s substantial investment is a validation for Eko, which was co-founded by the 37-year-old Yoni Bloch, who described himself in an interview in his New York office as \u201ca relatively famous singer in Israel.\u201d He has also been a judge on the Israeli version of \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201dWalmart was introduced to Eko when the retailer\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, met Mr. Bloch while visiting Israel last year.The two companies started working together on an interactive presentation that Eko prepared for Walmart\u2019s shareholder meeting \u2014 the annual corporate pep rally in Bentonville attended by thousands of workers.Walmart sees interactive storytelling \u2014 essentially a video version of \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d books \u2014 as something that can be used in both entertainment and advertising.There could be a cooking show, for instance, that helps viewers buy the ingredients online as they watch. Or a love story in which viewers can choose what happens to the characters. In turn, each choice could help Walmart glean insight into the viewers\u2019 preferences and attitudes.\u201cThe idea is around leapfrogging what everyone else is doing,\u201d Mr. Bloch said.A cross between a video game and traditional television, interactive storytelling has been held back by technology hurdles and tricky funding. Making one great traditional ad or TV episode is expensive enough, much less one that branches off in different directions depending on what choices people make while viewing.Interactive content has also been hindered by a generational divide. Older consumers \u2014 and media executives \u2014 are accustomed to a passive viewing experience and have a hard time grasping this way of participating in storytelling. Younger viewers are the opposite. (Netflix already has a few interactive shows aimed at children.)Eko is far from alone in chasing the promise of interactive content, but it has a secret weapon: Nancy Tellem. Ms. Tellem, who is Eko\u2019s executive chairman (and also sits on the MGM board), gives Eko considerable credibility in Hollywood. She worked in senior jobs at CBS and Warner Bros. Television for roughly two decades before joining Microsoft in 2012 to create an Xbox-centered television business. Microsoft shut down her division in 2015.For Mr. Bloch, Walmart reminds him of youthful visits to the United States.\u201cWalmart was to me the symbol of America,\u201d he said. \u201cI just remember my mom said we have to go to Walmart because everything is big and cheap there.\u201dHe started his company in 2010 with his bandmates, many of whom had a background in computing.Eko has attracted investments from Silicon Valley firms like Sequoia Capital, as well as establishment backers like Warner Music and Intel. In addition to the $250 million investment in the joint venture, Walmart has invested an undisclosed amount in Eko directly.Many of the details about the joint venture are still being worked out \u2014 like where these shows or advertisements can be viewed. Walmart and Eko said they would share in any revenue.The first project to come from the MGM partnership, which was announced at a conference on Wednesday in Los Angeles, will be a \u201creimagining\u201d of the comedy \u201cMr. Mom,\u201d which will debut on Vudu early next year.Mr. McCall said Vudu would work with MGM on revitalizing other classic movies and creating entirely new content.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated which title was Eko\u2019s first full-length interactive series. As another caption noted, it was \u201cThat Moment When,\u201d not \u201c#WarGames.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Keeps Adding Subscribers, and Market Investors Could Profit", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by__________More people sitting around watching Netflix may help rekindle some animal spirits in the stock market.The company on Tuesday reported that many more people signed up for its video-streaming service in the third quarter than expected. Netflix\u2019s shares soared as much as 13 percent in the trading that takes place after regular market hours.After the stock market suffered a steep swoon this month, results like that should help stocks recover. Netflix\u2019s report was the first from one of the big technology companies that helped drive the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to a record last month.Investors have charted the performance of these tech stocks by bunching them into a group they call FAANG, which includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Their contribution to the overall market has been significant. In the 12 months through Monday, the S. & P. 500 had risen 7.7 percent, but without the five technology stocks its performance was only 5.2 percent, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse.Netflix is the priciest of the five prominent technology companies. This makes it a good barometer for the amount of bullishness in the stock market. If the stock keeps rising over the coming weeks, it will underscore that investors still have a strong appetite for riskier companies, an attitude that might spill over into other technology firms.As Netflix\u2019s third-quarter results showed, it is doing well in some respects. It added seven million subscribers in the period, a larger amount than it added in the third quarter of last year. But the company is also consuming large sums of cash to finance its growth and borrowing more to cover its shortfall. Netflix also faces serious competitive threats, like Disney\u2019s plan to set up its own subscription video service.Yet an important stock market yardstick \u2014 the price-earnings ratio \u2014 suggests investors have an almost unquestioning faith in Netflix\u2019s ability to notch fast-growing earnings. This ratio compares its stock price with its earnings. Take a company with a stock trading at $100. If investors expect it to make $10 per share (its net income divided by the number of shares it has issued), it would have a price-earnings ratio of 10.The ratio for the companies in the S. & P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.Of course, it\u2019s still early in the earnings reporting season \u2014 and jarring disappointments may occur. Facebook is facing mounting regulatory scrutiny and is spending large sums on making its network more secure. Apple is trying to increase its revenue in part by selling higher-priced phones that may turn off some consumers.Outside of the technology space, investors are concerned that President Trump\u2019s trade wars may hurt the earnings of large manufacturing companies.But after stocks had a wobbly start to October, strong earnings have already helped reassure investors. Before Netflix reported its performance, two well-known Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, reported earnings that provided more evidence that the banking sector is in a good position to finance economic growth.After those reports and a few others, the S. & P. 500 jumped 2.15 percent, its biggest single-day gain since March.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Matthew Weiner on Life After \u2018Mad Men,\u2019 Sexual Harassment and His New Amazon Show", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLos Angeles \u2014 Before writing an episode of his new Amazon series \u201cThe Romanoffs,\u201d Matthew Weiner would ring a small bell. The trinket was a Christmas gift from one of the writers on the show, and the sound it made was essential for \u201cclearing the air,\u201d Mr. Weiner said. \u201cIt was a moment of faith in intuition and the process.\u201dInspiration did not arrive quite so easily for Mr. Weiner after \u201cMad Men\u201d went off the air in May 2015. Recently, in a Hollywood editing bay, Mr. Weiner described a long rough patch where he felt unable to think of a new idea. After finishing a novel called \u201cHeather, the Totality,\u201d he found himself turned on by the notion of closed-end stories, and resolved that his next television project would not be serialized. Instead, he would make an episodic anthology where the characters, and sometimes even the genre, were different week to week.The result is \u201cThe Romanoffs,\u201d which debuts Oct. 12 with two nearly 90-minute episodes. (In a break from the trend toward binge-watching, the next six installments will arrive every week thereafter.) The episodes, which Mr. Weiner also directed, take place all over the world yet have one unlikely thing in common: In each story, there are characters who believe themselves to be descendants of the Russian royal family whose reign came to a bloody end a century ago.Mr. Weiner, who is married with four children, rebuts the claim. But he acknowledges that he was not a perfect boss. \u201cI\u2019m sad that I might have caused people anguish in the job, or made people unhappy,\u201d he said. \u201cMight have? I did.\u201dThese are edited excerpts from the conversation.When did you know you wanted to make another television show?I didn\u2019t for a while. I really didn\u2019t. I got a lot of advice from people who said I should stop working for a while after \u201cMad Men\u201d and soak it in, and I was kind of into the time off. You have to reacquaint yourself with your family. I started watching TV in a noncompetitive atmosphere, and really stopped writing anything down, even notes, because \u201cMad Men\u201d stories were still coming to me for a while after that.Even after the show was off the air?And it\u2019s like, what am I going to do with that? I wanted to try the discipline of not thinking that way. What if I were to experience things without the purpose of trying to turn it into a story? Then I tried to turn it back on again after six or eight months, and it was really bad. Nothing was happening. Then I went to Yaddo [an artists\u2019 retreat] and started my novel. Everything was activated by the novel. There was something about telling a story that was not continuing.You had a story people wanted to continue. People were clamoring for a \u201cMad Men\u201d spinoff about Sally Draper.That was very flattering, actually. I loved that. I\u2019m curious what would happen to her, too, but I didn\u2019t want to do that. I liked leaving the show where it was.\u201cThe Romanoffs\u201d is very different than \u201cMad Men,\u201d and even different from other anthology shows on television now. No matter which \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d episode you\u2019re watching, you know it will be about the perils of modern technology. I\u2019m not sure \u201cThe Romanoffs\u201d is as easy to sum up in a sentence.Not to quote Don Draper, but you want to be a needle in a haystack, you don\u2019t want to be a haystack. If I went in pitching, \u201cIt\u2019s Don Draper, but it\u2019s a woman in a pharmaceutical company \u2026\u201d I said that as a joke to someone I was pitching to, and he said, \u201cSold!\u201d But I don\u2019t want to do that. You know, they didn\u2019t want \u201cMad Men\u201d at first, either, so asking for another \u201cMad Men\u201d is funny. But what is the one-sentence thing? I don\u2019t know.When it came to \u201cMad Men,\u201d you challenged AMC on the episode length, the budget and the expense of the licensed songs. And now I watch \u201cThe Romanoffs,\u201d and the episodes are feature-length, incredibly lavish and filled with famous, expensive songs. Did Amazon let you have carte blanche?It was a wildest-dreams scenario. I will say that I don\u2019t know what people think an episode of TV costs, but we\u2019re not in the realm of \u201cWestworld\u201d or \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d But I did say, \u201cThese are the things I would like to do that I couldn\u2019t do on \u2018Mad Men.\u2019\u201d And music was definitely part of it.Why an episodic anthology?I\u2019m not a trailblazer or a disrupter. I\u2019m just thinking in terms of the audience: Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have something that was on once a week that you didn\u2019t have to catch up with and you could watch in any order?You made a list of rules before you convened your writers\u2019 room for \u201cThe Romanoffs,\u201d and one of those rules says, \u201cIdeas (especially intellectual) have no place in entertainment.\u201d The three episodes I\u2019ve seen are concerned with wealth, race and sex, among other ideas.But I\u2019m not trying to write about race, I\u2019m trying to write about some people that I know who are racist. \u201cSomeone who becomes political\u201d is a story, but \u201cpolitics\u201d is not. It\u2019s just about character.Do you have any regrets over the way \u201cMad Men\u201d treated race?I felt it would be a fantasy, unless I did an entire parallel show, to show the lives of black people through that world. I regret that on some level. There were black ad agencies, you know? But those characters were not in each others\u2019 worlds. It was an extremely segregated society even in New York. I\u2019m interested in fairness, if that makes sense, and representation.There are 16 people on the poster for \u201cThe Romanoffs,\u201d and every one of them is white.The famous people are white, that\u2019s true. Most of these characters are really rich. This Romanov thing, it\u2019s not like there couldn\u2019t be Romanovs of different races. I don\u2019t know what to tell you. There is a lot of diversity in the cast; they\u2019re just not people that you know. You will know them, hopefully.The main characters in the first three episodes are all fairly wealthy. Does that persist through the whole show?No, there are some regular people in there. It depends on the episode \u2014 they\u2019re all different from each other. I don\u2019t think that on Episode 3, which is set backstage on a mini-series, it really matters at all.The first two episodes both feature a middle-aged man in an unhappy relationship who\u2019s tempted by an affair with a younger woman.I don\u2019t know if I would characterize the first one that way. Certainly, in the second episode, that is about a marriage. The scene where the wife gets into bed and turns off the light and he says, \u201cI guess we\u2019re going to bed now,\u201d so many people have told me, \u201cWere you in my house?\u201d Because that\u2019s a long-term relationship. For me, the temptation for both of those people is the wish that there was something more exciting in their lives.Whenever the husband in that episode fantasizes about another woman, the camera takes his perspective and ogles the woman from head to toe.Right, because he is projecting this onto her. She is exotic and objectified by him, but that\u2019s in his mind. They\u2019re at an impasse in their marriage, and it is 50/50 to me. His wife has half the story.But the camera never adopts the wife\u2019s perspective in the same way that the camera adopts his.I don\u2019t think she\u2019s as warped as he is, in terms of his fantasy. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m using the camera to do anything other than make you laugh at how improbable it is. When you make an actor, male or female, look attractive and do their makeup and put them in a costume that\u2019s flattering, are you objectifying them? I don\u2019t know.What did you make of the Kater Gordon article once you read it?I have reasons I don\u2019t believe that I said it, if that makes sense, but I really don\u2019t remember saying it. I mean, Kater and I were in a room together nine hours a day for six months, six days a week, and I just don\u2019t remember having that attitude. I didn\u2019t feel that way about her. I was surprised that so many years later, I was being told about that. We worked together for a year, and it did not work out.Why didn\u2019t it work out? She had won an Emmy the season before she was let go.There\u2019s lots of reasons. That was a really hard year for the staff on the show, and it was a very difficult year for getting story. I had a lot of people with no experience, and they needed to get experience elsewhere because it was too much work. In the end, she was not asked back, which is how we do it in TV. I really remember she was supposed to come down [to the office] to have that conversation with me, and she knew what it was about. Who would want to come down for that? So it was done over the phone. We did have a conversation that I really regret, the way it went. It was a lot of questions and a lot of answers, and it was not polite, and I never did it that way again.What do you mean when you say it was not polite?To do it over the phone and end up in an argument. It was really mean: \u201cI don\u2019t want you to work here anymore, and these are the reasons.\u201d It\u2019s something you should do in person. It was heated, and it was not what I wanted. I had not been the boss very long. I had watched a lot of people do it, and I think that I was very casual about my responsibility to have higher standards of language, of humor, of everything.I was surprised to hear that she had this experience of working with me. She was very interested in how I worked, and she was very instructive to me on how to use the room, because I didn\u2019t want to go in the writers\u2019 room. I couldn\u2019t deal with the pressure all the time of going in there and not hearing what I needed to hear and having to come up with stuff on my own. I was a very demanding boss. Some of it is continuing a tradition of hazing, in a weird way.Had you been hazed in other writers\u2019 rooms?Oh yeah. Absolutely. I wanted to give people an easier ride than I had.Has there been any course correction in the way you behave?Honestly, the course correction happened during the show. I can say this because I\u2019ve been on both sides of it, but there are very few other jobs \u2014 maybe being a model \u2014 where when you critique someone\u2019s work as a writer, you are crossing a boundary into the personal immediately. But I was a very demanding boss. The show\u2019s not going to happen if you don\u2019t do it, and someone has to make these decisions. Because of that, when scripts come in and they\u2019re not the way you want them, you get mad at people for not doing things the way you would have done it, and that is just wrong. But no one cried in my room. Did you ever cry when you were a writer in someone else\u2019s room?Yes, I did. I felt that I had been treated way worse than I had ever treated anybody on my show. I\u2019ve never shared people\u2019s first drafts. I never did anything that I felt was crossing the line. You get rewritten, and it\u2019s embarrassing, but in a comedy room, they put your script up on the screen and 12 people see what you wrote and rewrite it. I think the fact that I\u2019ve retained 85 percent of my crew from the first season of \u201cMad Men\u201d over eight years is because it wasn\u2019t a crappy place to work. It\u2019s hard for me to believe that it was that bad.I remember once that at a Q. and A. for your film \u201cAre You Here,\u201d you told an audience member that you cared more what strangers thought of you than the people who know you well. Wow. You can write down that I\u2019m smiling, because out there in the world right now are lots of writers, painters, performers who are smiling at the baldness of that statement. I don\u2019t feel that way anymore, I can tell you that.It feels germane to \u201cThe Romanoffs,\u201d because many of these characters are preoccupied with how they come across to people who barely know them.Here\u2019s the most uncomfortable thing about that statement: What an ugly thing to admit, what a shallowness there is to that. Who I am and how I\u2019m perceived is literally the same question of nature and nurture to me: It\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside and what\u2019s on the outside. I do care what strangers think, but who doesn\u2019t? And if you end up in the public, you realize, \u201cI can\u2019t care too much, because a lot of the strangers aren\u2019t out there to pat you on the back.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Amazon to Raise Minimum Wage to $15 for All U.S. Workers", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon said on Tuesday that it would raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour for its United States employees, a rare acknowledgment that it was feeling squeezed by political pressure and a tight labor market. The raises apply for part-time workers and those hired through temporary agencies.The company said it would also lobby Washington to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been set at $7.25 for almost a decade.The new wages will apply to more than 250,000 Amazon employees, including those at the grocery chain Whole Foods, as well as the more than 100,000 seasonal employees it plans to hire for the holiday season. The change will not apply to contract workers. It goes into effect on Nov. 1.\u201cWe listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,\u201d Amazon\u2019s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.\u201dAt the same time, jobs at Amazon\u2019s warehouses and sorting centers have boomed. The company now employs about 575,000 people worldwide, up more than 50 percent in the past year, a fact Amazon frequently plays up.\u201cI think they saw the writing on the wall. I think they saw the calculation that it was indefensible that a man whose wealth is over $150 billion be able to continue paying workers wages that are so low that they are forced to rely on federal benefits,\u201d Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said in an interview after the announcement. \u201cSmart people are willing to change course.\u201dAmazon had been paying a starting minimum wage of $11 an hour, and said its average wage for full-time workers at the fulfillment centers where it packages and sorts orders was more than $15 an hour. It had not disclosed pay for part-time and contract workers. Amazon said workers who now make more than $15 an hour will also get a pay bump, though it won\u2019t say how much.Mr. Sanders said he was particularly surprised to see Mr. Bezos raising pay to $15 almost immediately, rather than phasing it in over several years.\u201cThat is bold, no question about it,\u201d he said. Mr. Bezos thanked Mr. Sanders on Twitter for praising the change. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about this, and also hope others will join in,\u201d Mr. Bezos wrote.Amazon has added robots at its warehouses and has expanded experiments like Amazon Go, its cashierless convenience stores that require few employees. But it still has a huge need for workers, particularly as the holiday season approaches. With the United States unemployment rate below 4 percent, the tight labor market has made it harder to attract the workers it and other retailers need.\u201cAt the moment in the United States, unemployment is pretty low, and Amazon may be struggling to recruit and retain employees,\u201d said Alan Manning, an economics professor at the London School of Economics who has studied minimum wage policies. \u201cIt\u2019s also a bit of good publicity.\u201dIndeed, less than an hour after the announcement on Tuesday, Dave Clark, Amazon\u2019s senior vice president in charge of operations, posted a video on Twitter of employees at a fulfillment center in Southern California cheering as he broke the news to them.Amazon also announced minimum pay increases to \u00a310.50 in London and \u00a39.50 elsewhere in Britain. It said the minimum pay would benefit 17,000 Amazon employees and more than 20,000 seasonal workers in the country.The wage increase comes as the company plans to announce the location of its second headquarters before the end of this year. The new site, which Amazon says will eventually employ up to 50,000 highly paid technology workers, is widely expected to get what could be billions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives from state and local governments.Given the political divide in the current Congress, Mr. Sanders said it still seemed unlikely that higher wages would pass. Instead, Mr. Sanders said, it\u2019s more likely to become a campaign issue, as well as put pressure on other large employers. Mr. Bezos\u2019s \u201cdecision today is going to have a ripple effect to other corporations and other cities and states,\u201d he said.And unions say Amazon is not off the hook either. Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which is in the early stages of working with employees at Whole Foods, said in a statement that the wage increase was a \u201cpositive step.\u201d But he said it did not address other conditions, like giving more workers full-time positions and alleviating the production pressure some employees feel.\u201cThere is still so very much more that Amazon needs to do to be considered a decent employer,\u201d he said.Adam Satariano contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Silicon Valley Can\u2019t Escape the Business of War", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMany in the tech industry don\u2019t want to be part of the military-industrial complex. But defense work is already part of Silicon Valley\u2019s DNA.Ms. O\u2019Mara, a professor of history, is the author of a forthcoming book about the origins of Silicon Valley.It may not be a popular position, but Mr. Bezos\u2019s comments reveal an important truth: The Pentagon has been part of the Silicon Valley story all along. Defense contracts during and after World War II turned Silicon Valley from a somnolent landscape of fruit orchards into a hub of electronics production and innovations ranging from mainframes to microprocessors to the internet. The American tech economy rests on the foundations of the military-industrial complex. Yet Silicon Valley\u2019s culture is deeply influenced by skepticism about this same military establishment.The result is an enduring technological optimism. Early Silicon Valley didn\u2019t have a J. Robert Oppenheimer publicly despairing over his murderous creation. Instead, it had an ebullient regional booster, Fred Terman, an engineer and university administrator who used the bounty of military money to turn Stanford from a middling school with a good football team into an engineering powerhouse.Big defense certainly made its mark. The region\u2019s biggest employer from the 1950s through the end of the Cold War was Lockheed. Local start-ups of the time also benefited, and they attracted people with engineering backgrounds, not necessarily military ones. Take, for example, David Packard, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard. An outspoken critic of government overreach, Packard believed that tech businesses should aspire to higher things. \u201cI think many people assume, wrongly, that a company exists simply to make money,\u201d he once told HP executives. \u201cWhile this is an important result of a company\u2019s existence, we have to go deeper to find the real reasons for our being.\u201dThe next generation of Silicon Valley technologists took these sentiments further. They grew up dreaming of space and winning science fairs supported by defense money; their first encounters with computers were often in government-funded university labs. Yet by the time they graduated from college in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of them wanted nothing to do with the military-industrial complex. So they seeded companies that repurposed technologies built for war to everyday life. They stayed in academia, moved into industrial research labs or started storefront computer-education centers and community message boards.Then they founded computer companies infused with an ethos that was part counterculture, part cowboy. \u201cThe personal computer operator is the Electronic Man on Horseback riding into the (sinking) Western sun,\u201d declared a columnist in the newsletter InfoWorld in 1980. \u201cHe is the last of the rugged individualists, and the personal computer is his only effective weapon.\u201dWhether their employees realize it or not, today\u2019s tech giants all contain some defense-industry DNA. The result is the conflicted identity we now see in Silicon Valley. Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, is the author of a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": " A Toast to Bulldogs in Tuxedos and Chihuahuas in Chiffon", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWell-dressed wedding guests, with four legs, are becoming the norm.Frank, a stubby English bulldog dressed in a navy tuxedo adorned with a gold-sequined bow tie, ambled down the aisle through the North Carolina grass at his owners\u2019 wedding. He looked quite the part \u2014 that is, until he plopped down to relax during the ceremony. \u201cFrankie has such a human quality about him,\u201d said the bride and owner, Emily Enriquez. \u201cHe has this big, broad-shouldered look, and I thought he would look really cute in a tuxedo.\u201dMs. Enriquez and her husband, Brian Enriquez, decided they wanted Frank to be a part of their March 2017 ceremony because he had served as a major part of their relationship \u2014 he joined their family a little over a year after they had been dating. Ms. Enriquez searched for high-quality attire (not from the average party store) to match the rest of the wedding party. On Etsy, she found a dog tuxedo and bow tie from Happydog Pet Couture for $130.The outlet is one of a growing number of Etsy shops and high-end pet couture designers catering to couples wishing to include their pets in their wedding. The animals may serve as ring bearers, or just well-dressed crowd pleasers during the reception. The Etsy shops\u2019 pieces typically cost under $100. Other formal pet attire can be found elsewhere online, with some pieces from larger pet designers costing as much as $300.\u201cShe was a star of the night,\u201d he said. Anna Konokhova, the owner of Happydog Pet Couture, began selling on Etsy in 2016. She started making elaborate bows for her Shih Tzu, then branched out to dresses after receiving requests from friends for additional designs. She did a design for a Yorkie in a wedding in 2015. She created a few more outfits for friends, until she posted photos on Etsy in 2016. The post attracted many more requests from engaged couples. Weddings are now her main business, she said. Ms. Konokhova makes all her outfits by hand and communicates with clients in various time zones for ways to customize her creations, which typically arrive in four to five weeks. She became so dedicated to her craft that she would carry around a measuring tape so should could measure various breeds of dogs on the street in order to better serve her customers.Tonya Hart of Wichita, Kan., opened the House of FurBaby on Etsy four years ago, and started marketing to the wedding crowd in the last couple of years. Sales volume has soared from around 500 a year to about 500 a month. Ms. Hart says she plans to open a brick-and-mortar store in Wichita this month. She has dressed dogs from many breeds in outfits sewn by a hired seamstress. For many couples, Ms. Hart said, \u201cthe pet is that one family that they share,\u201d which makes it especially important to include it in the wedding planning. For Patti Crouch of Houston, her love for her rat terrier, Lexi, even weathered Hurricane Harvey last year. She bought a white dress with a red bow from House of FurBaby (to match her Christmas-themed wedding) for Lexi, right before the storm hit. Despite a few complications (including delayed alterations for her own wedding dress), and in the chaos of planning, Ms. Crouch still included her dog.\u201cShe\u2019s been my best friend,\u201d Ms. Crouch said of Lexi, who walked around with the flower girl at the reception. Casey O\u2019Donnell and Kelly O\u2019Donnell didn\u2019t have their pets participate in the actual wedding this past summer, but they had them photographed for a \u201csave the date\u201d announcement. It was a bit tricky, they admitted, keeping Marty, an Old English Sheepdog, and their cat, Pete, in their attire, which they bought on Amazon. Sometimes, though, just a decorative collar will do. \u201cPeople take it quite seriously,\u201d said Jodie Vigor of Cupid Collars in Surrey, England, which embellishes collars with silk or foam flowers and other decorations. As for Frank, the tuxedo-wearing bulldog, his owners managed to keep him in his formal attire throughout the wedding. \u201cHe liked wearing it,\u201d Ms. Enriquez said, \u201cbecause we fed him ham constantly to keep him compliant.\u201d Advertisement"}

These are the 10 we like best.Most made-for-TV creature features \u2014 including the homoerotic 1974 werewolf pic \u201cScream of the Wolf,\u201d which pits a mild-mannered author against a deranged big game hunter \u2014 don\u2019t deliver enough monster footage. In \u201cMoon of the Wolf,\u201d the director Daniel Petrie and screenwriter Alvin Sapinsley (eventually) spring a Lon Chaney Jr.-like werewolf on a manly Louisiana sheriff (David Janssen), albeit a werewolf who, unlike the sheriff, likes to button up his collared shirt. (Jannsen\u2019s prominently displayed chest hair is practically a supporting character.) Until the lupine star is released, viewers are treated to a sudsy procedural that revolves around Ellie (who is never seen on-camera) and her unborn child, the werewolf\u2019s first victims. The sheriff\u2019s search for the father of Ellie\u2019s unborn child almost overshadows his search for a killer werewolf \u2014 but only almost.

Hooper and Monash also give each protagonist at least one great scene, like when the square-jawed author Ben Mears (David Soul) struggles to remember the Lord\u2019s Prayer right before a newly-undead vampire pounces on him. The success of \u201cSalem\u2019s Lot\u201d as an ensemble drama is especially striking since James Mason, playing a snooty human antagonist, steals almost every scene he\u2019s in. Hooper and Monash also do a fine job dramatizing the novel\u2019s moodiest scare scenes, especially when the grade school vampires Danny and Ralphie Glick (Brad Savage and Ralphie Scribner) float outside their victims\u2019 bedroom windows and silently hypnotize viewers with crooked fangs and glow-in-the-dark contact lenses.The director Tobe Hooper (\u201cThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre\u201d) and the screenwriter Paul Monash skillfully pare down the 653-page source novel from Stephen King, which follows the residents of a small Maine town as they fight off a centuries-old vampire.

But with its convincing acting and special effects, the film still has the power to unnerve viewers who know better now. Even the most jaded horror fans will find themselves drawn in as the genial host Michael Parkinson (playing himself) poses and fields questions from a skeptical on-the-spot TV reporter named Sarah Greene (herself) and fictional callers, almost all of whom report the same story: a mysterious figure named Pipes is haunting the young Early sisters, Suzanne and Kim (the real-life siblings Michelle and Cherise Wesson). And the more attention that Pipes gets, the stronger he becomes.

But it does offer two chilling lead performances, from Ray Winstone as the sexually impotent and psychologically withdrawn Todd, and from Essie Davis as Mrs. Lovett, who cooks Todd\u2019s victims into meat pies. Davis is riveting as the unhappily married Lovett, who believes that God is punishing her for cheating on her husband. And Winstone brings extra weight to every snarl and pout as he slits throats and performs Victorian-era surgery on supporting characters (like a hapless lawman played by Tom Hardy). Stephen Sondheim\u2019s musical may rightfully be the most famous version of Todd\u2019s story, but Winstone\u2019s and Davis\u2019s commanding performances make this BBC adaptation a strong version.This appropriately lurid adaptation of \u201cThe String of Pearls\u201d \u2014 the 19th century penny dreadful serial that introduced the murderous Sweeney Todd \u2014 doesn\u2019t offer musical numbers.

In it, a self-absorbed journalist named Juan (Javier Guti\u00e9rrez) struggles to balance writing assignments, parental responsibilities and his frustrated libido while his concerned wife, Sonia (Leonor Watling), grows increasingly impatient. But Juan\u2019s life soon takes an eerie turn when he spots a mysterious black figure hovering over his newborn son\u2019s crib. The intruder returns every night, but Juan can only spot him on his son\u2019s infrared baby monitor. But is the intruder a ghost, a doppelg\u00e4nger or a figment of Juan\u2019s imagination? The imaginative plot by de la Iglesia and his co-writer, Jorge Guerricaechevarr\u00eda, will keep you guessing until the end.The first half of this darkly funny ghost story from the Spanish writer-director \u00c1lex de la Iglesia plays out like a domestic farce.

{"Headline": "Uncomplicated Technology, and Why It\u2019s Always Worth Your Money", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf you believe the marketing, you\u2019d think every new gadget will change your life \u2014 but many are confusing to use or doomed to obsolescence. Here\u2019s how to determine whether your purchase will stand the test of time.As my daughter said, it\u2019s \u201c3-D printing in real time.\u201d But the pen is fun to use and a great example of \u201cuncomplicated\u201d tech. There\u2019s no byzantine software to learn. In fact, you don\u2019t need a computer to use it, and you can get up-and-running quickly. In many ways, it\u2019s a model of how all consumer technology should be, and what sets the tech that stands the test of time from the gear that\u2019s forgotten in a year or two: It\u2019s uncomplicated. But Mr. Zeldman said that in the past 20 years, there has been a shift. The products that have been most successful, particularly digital products and services, \u201chaven\u2019t been the most advanced, sophisticated or beautiful, necessarily,\u201d he explained, \u201cbut they were the ones that understood what consumers wanted to do and enabled them to do it.\u201d This is what made Amazon, Google and Apple so powerful. This notion can also be used to discover why products fail. Take Microsoft\u2019s misstep in redesigning the Windows 8 operating system: The move was almost universally panned for removing the hallmark \u201cStart\u201d button users had come to rely on. The new \u201cMetro\u201d tiled interface was certainly sophisticated and attractive, reflected how the market was changing, and incorporated mobile-friendly design elements. But it misunderstood what consumers wanted \u2014 namely a consistent starting point. The key to determining whether some new piece of technology, whether it\u2019s a gadget, app or website, will work for you \u2014 and better yet, stand the test of time \u2014 is how uncomplicated it is, and how easy it is to do what the product is designed to do. Here are a few factors to help you evaluate before you sign up, or spend your money. For most things, you may only need a very simple product or app. Those who may want more sophistication will have to spend time finding a full-featured alternative. \u201cIf there\u2019s a learning curve,\u201d Mr. Zeldman said, \u201cdoes it teach you a new way to think about that subject and make you better at what you do?\u201d If so, that product might be worth it. If you buy a high-end camera, you can learn how to shoot a vast array of creative photos. But if you\u2019re just shooting simple selfies, you might be wasting your money. \u201cIf I\u2019m downloading an app from Apple\u2019s app store, I read the reviews first. I study the screenshots there, since they\u2019re representative of the app,\u201d Mr. Zeldman said. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m interested in downloading a photo app, but if the filters are ugly in the screenshot, I know it\u2019s not for me.\u201d It\u2019s also O.K. to stop using a cheap or inexpensive app after you\u2019ve downloaded it. \u201cOne of the great things about apps is that you can also try out a limited-feature version (only certain elements of the app are turned on), and see if it works for you before you decide to pay for the full product,\u201d Mr. Zeldman said. It\u2019s difficult, but not impossible, to try out hardware like a camera or speaker. See if you can borrow a friend\u2019s device to try it out. Or try renting one. With a large item, like a TV, visit a friend who has bought the same (or similar) product and see how it works. As a teacher, I find this to be a valuable gauge of how much the company really cares. A stand-alone scanner I once bought had a manual that stopped midway through the instructions \u2014 not surprisingly, I rarely used that scanner. Conversely, a digital camera I once reviewed had a number of simple, well-illustrated tip sections built right into the camera menu, which were invaluable to a novice and even helpful for experienced shooters. Obviously, this is easier if you\u2019re not out a lot of money. \u201cIf an app isn\u2019t helping me,\u201d Mr. Zeldman said, \u201cI just wipe it off my phone and don\u2019t give it another thought.\u201d The reviews might be good and it might be well regarded, but don\u2019t bother with it if it doesn\u2019t suit your needs. As for pricey gadgets, you\u2019ll want to do research beforehand. However, the same philosophy applies: After you\u2019ve done your research, if the product in question doesn\u2019t suit your needs or budget, walk away. Return it or, better yet, sell it. If you\u2019re looking for tech that\u2019s uncomplicated, you can\u2019t really make an assessment if you don\u2019t know what\u2019s available or what\u2019s changed. If you were looking for a high-end camera 10 years ago, the best viewfinders were through-the-lens viewfinders found on digital single-lens reflex cameras. At the time, electronic viewfinders were mediocre, grainy and inferior. Today\u2019s electronic viewfinders, though are just about as clear and sharp. Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Blumhouse Studio, Scary at the Box Office, Gets Serious About TV", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt won\u2019t be easy.Blumhouse also knows that it will have to move beyond monsters and the paranormal if it wants to reach a large TV audience.\u201cOur movie company makes seven to 10 movies a year,\u201d Marci Wiseman, who runs Blumhouse\u2019s TV division with Jeremy Gold, said in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019re charged with populating the airwaves.\u201dShe noted that there were only so many slots for scary television shows. \u201cIf we could, we would own every one of those slots and gladly do so,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we also want to be omnipresent and be a studio that is making as many shows as we think deserve to have their stories told.\u201dBlumhouse has experienced success on TV before. It was a producer on HBO\u2019s acclaimed thriller \u201cSharp Objects\u201d this summer and the Emmy-winning documentary series \u201cThe Jinx\u201d in 2015. But it has also been behind a series of forgettable one-season flops like \u201cThe River\u201d (ABC), \u201cStranded\u201d (Syfy), \u201cEye Candy\u201d (MTV) and \u201cSouth of Hell\u201d (WE TV).The anthology series on Hulu will consist of a new television movie under the \u201cInto the Dark\u201d banner every month for the next year. In addition, there is a television adaptation of the Blumhouse franchise \u201cThe Purge\u201d on USA, and \u201cSacred Lies,\u201d a young-adult drama on Facebook Watch. Going into production next month for Showtime is an adaptation of a Roger Ailes biography starring Russell Crowe. Several other projects are in production, including unscripted series.In other words, not too many ghosts. Blumhouse executives explained that only 20 percent of the studio\u2019s television projects will be traditional horror fare. (The movie division is somewhere closer to 80 percent, Mr. Blum said.)Or, as Mr. Gold put it, \u201cit\u2019s simple sales: To only be peddling horror, that\u2019s not a great way to scale a whole studio.\u201dMs. Wiseman and Mr. Gold were speaking from the no-frills, cramped headquarters of Blumhouse in Historic Filipinotown. The pair work out of a small box of a room where a glass wall separates the roughly five feet of space between their seats. They often communicate by taping Post-it notes to the glass.\u201cThat\u2019s the thing with Blumhouse: You have all this production, but we don\u2019t have a lot of space!\u201d Ms. Wiseman said.When Mr. Blum hired Ms. Wiseman and Mr. Gold, he also decided to rip up his game plan for television. He wanted to build a studio where Blumhouse would be calling the shots.\u201cIn the movies, we\u2019re running everything. We make all the decisions,\u201d Mr. Blum said in an interview. \u201cOn the production, we\u2019re in charge 100 percent. And so I\u2019d go from that to television, where I was asking permission to brush my teeth. For everything! It was extremely frustrating.\u201dStill, Mr. Blum described building a successful independent studio as a big financial risk.\u201cIt is harder than ever to cut through the clutter,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. \u201cThe flip side to that there is more opportunity for independent players to develop content. It\u2019s harder to have massive audiences but it\u2019s also easier to find someone take a chance on quality content.\u201dOne of the first orders of business for the television unit was to discard the company\u2019s policy of shoestring budgets. The reason? Streaming services like Netflix, HBO and Amazon are more than happy to spend more on one episode of a TV series \u2014 $5 million plus \u2014 than Blumhouse does on some of its feature films.\u201cI\u2019m not saying people are saying, \u2018Please spend as much money as possible,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wiseman said. \u201cBut there are just a bunch of buyers that are not price-sensitive.\u201dIf it works, they\u2019ll have continuing series on basic cable and streaming services. And they\u2019ll have glossy shows, like \u201cSharp Objects\u201d or the Ailes limited series, where, Ms. Wiseman explained, \u201cthe economics may not be as fantastic but the kind of heightened storytelling is really the goal.\u201d Essentially, to burnish the reputation of the Blumhouse brand.\u201cInto the Dark\u201d is one of the projects reminiscent of its Blumhouse film brethren.

{"Headline": "Netflix\u2019s Audience Is Multiplying. But So Is Its Debt.", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesNetflix, the streaming-video juggernaut, is growing with astonishing speed. And if you ignore the fact that it borrows billions to finance that growth, the company is a classic success story.Wall Street has embraced Netflix as one of the so-called Faangs \u2014 short for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (which trades as Alphabet). The technology titans propelled investors to enormous profits for much of this year.With Netflix\u2019s resounding success in forging \u2014 and, so far, dominating \u2014 the global market for streaming video, it may seem churlish to harbor any misgivings.Yet Netflix poses a difficult problem for investors. All of those movies and TV shows are expensive, and in order to fuel its explosive expansion, the company has been spending faster than it has been taking in cash \u2014 and expects to keep doing so for years. Netflix has built its business on a mountain of junk-rated debt.Not everyone is persuaded, however.\u201cNetflix\u2019s fundamental business model seems unsustainable,\u201d said Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, who has examined the company\u2019s numbers closely. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it is going to work out.\u201dWith increased competition looming in streaming video, he said, Netflix must keep spending enormous sums on content and marketing. If it cuts spending, he said, it is likely to lose much of its precious audience.\u201cSure, the company is growing rapidly now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has an amazing number of new movies and TV shows. For a consumer, that\u2019s great. But for an investor, it\u2019s a different story: The more Netflix grows, the more its costs grow and the more money it burns. I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s ever going to turn that around.\u201dThe company\u2019s shares, in his estimation, are worth buying as a serious investment only at about $177. But Netflix has been trading around $310 a share lately, after surpassing $400 earlier this year.In a nutshell, the problem is the disparity between money in and money out \u2014 and Professor Damodaran\u2019s presumption that Netflix\u2019s costs must remain high, if it is to keep growing.Netflix\u2019s cash-flow statement indicates that in the 12 months through September, it spent $11.7 billion on new content. But its income statement indicates that total revenues were $14.9 billion, leaving it only about $3.2 billion to pay for marketing and the rest of its operations. That wasn\u2019t enough to run the business, so the company has borrowed money.Professor Damodaran is not the only Netflix skeptic. In a note to investors on Oct. 17, Michael Nathanson, a senior analyst with MoffettNathanson, said that the company\u2019s stock price was baffling, and he estimated that a more realistic level was about $210.In a similar vein, Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities and a longtime critic, said he expected Netflix to continue to have difficulty matching costs and cash flow, given increasing competition in streaming video \u2014 and the likely loss of movies and TV shows controlled by its competitors.Disney and Time Warner (which owns HBO) are revamping their offerings. And Hulu (owned collectively by Disney and Comcast), Apple, Amazon and Google (which owns YouTube) are now all serious adversaries, he said. In his estimation, Netflix stock is worth only about $150 a share.If Netflix were to fall anywhere near that level \u2014 losing a gut-wrenching half of its market value \u2014 its corporate competitors would presumably be powering ahead with their own streaming offerings. Yet it would not be surprising if some of them \u2014 the recently merged AT&T-Time Warner entity, for example \u2014 wondered whether their own marriages made much sense without Netflix\u2019s unbidden influence.How worried should the stock market be about Netflix? It has shrugged off such concerns most of this year: From Jan. 1 through July 9, Netflix\u2019s shares returned a staggering 118 percent.Since July 9, however, tech stocks have fallen and Netflix has been pummeled. Despite brief surges, its share price has dropped more than 25 percent since that peak.\u201cYou get a show or a movie you\u2019re really dying to watch, and you end up staying up late at night, so we actually compete with sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re winning!\u201dIn the latest earnings call, he said that deep-pocketed companies, like Disney, AT&T and Google, were real competitors. \u201cSomeday there will have to be competition for wallet share; we\u2019re not na\u00efve about that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems very far off from everything we\u2019ve seen.\u201dNetflix, he said, needs to continue to be \u201cfocusing on our fundamentals\u201d \u2014 supplying viewers with compelling entertainment and delivering it in innovative ways.But that will cost the company a lot of money. For consumers, that may not be a problem at all. Netflix has already made video entertainment far more abundant and diverse than it was just a few years ago, and as other companies join the fray, the cornucopia of choices is likely to become even deeper.But does that make Netflix a great stock? You may want to look closely at the numbers.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

But now, for the first time, they are starting to look consistent \u2014 with four consecutive quarters above $1 billion in profit.On Thursday, the company reported a net income of $2.9 billion in the third quarter, surpassing analyst expectations. But the focus on profit that investors have long sought wasn\u2019t enough to keep them happy. The company\u2019s shares dropped more than 7 percent in aftermarket trading, after Amazon also announced that revenue in its core retail business was growing more slowly than in the past.The company\u2019s sales were up 29 percent to $56.6 billion, below what analysts had predicted. In Amazon\u2019s biggest business, its online store, sales rose just 11 percent over the past year. A year ago, the pace was twice as quick.\u201cThey are saturating the core market in the U.S. for e-commerce,\u201d said Cooper Smith, who leads Amazon research for Gartner L2. \u201cThis is a company in transition right now,\u201d moving from a focus on acquiring more customers to getting more growth from people who already shop the site.Profit was up in part because Amazon\u2019s leadership has focused on trimming costs to counteract the slower growth. \u201cWe have really been able to cut back in a number of key areas,\u201d Brian Olsavsky, the company\u2019s chief financial officer, said in a call with reporters.He said the company saved money by redeploying engineers rather than hiring more new staff and being more efficient in its warehouses and data centers. About 613,000 people now work at Amazon, up 13 percent from the same time last year. Mr. Olsavsky said that over the course of 2017, the number of employees jumped 38 percent, not including its new Whole Foods workers.\u201cThe theme will be banking some of the investment from prior years,\u201d Mr. Olsavsky said in a later call with analysts.Amazon has made a push in recent months to get more out of its high-margin areas, especially its industry-leading cloud computing services, a huge business with 31 percent operating margins this quarter.Its Prime memberships are another area: This year, Amazon raised the annual price of a Prime Membership by 20 percent, to $119. The number of new members signing up for Prime has been slowing, down to just 1 to 2 percent a quarter, according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, a firm that surveys users for brands and investors.Those lucrative markets let Amazon plow cash into new businesses that require intense physical investments and engineering talent, like expanding fast grocery delivery or building out its Alexa ecosystem. \u201cNow the investment is not a cycle \u2014 it\u2019s just a way of life,\u201d said Brian Nowak, who researches Amazon at Morgan Stanley.The company has been spending heavily in its international operations, in particular India, looking for its next enormous consumer market. International sales were up just 15 percent over the previous year, to $15.5 billion. Amazon\u2019s international sales are not profitable, though the margins are improving.As part of the wage increase, Amazon ended the bonus and stock grants it had been giving workers, which analysts estimated would offset some of the costs, as would increased efficiencies using robotics. Mr. Olsavsky declined to provide details of the costs associated with the new wage.\u201cOne of Amazon\u2019s weapons against competitors is the confidence of Wall Street,\u201d Mr. Smith said, \u201cto be able to show that when we start a new business in a new category, we can send the value of legacy businesses in those industries plummeting.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Check back each week for more recommendations.This earnest mini-series highlights some of the most beloved books in the country in interviews with authors, celebrities and civilians, with the slightly corny hook of asking people to vote for their favorites. This week\u2019s installment, \u201cVillains & Monsters,\u201d includes conversations with Gillian Flynn, Margaret Atwood and Dean Koontz, as well as with literature enthusiasts who rep for their favorite books: \u201cFrankenstein,\u201d \u201cMoby Dick,\u201d \u201cThe Picture of Dorian Gray\u201d and \u201cRebecca\u201d among them.I\u2019m more convinced than ever that a grown-up version of \u201cReading Rainbow\u201d would work, and \u201cThe Great American Read\u201d is proof. Even the papercut-style animated interludes are nutritive.When \u201cWill & Grace\u201d returned last year, it was overly obsessed with Trump jokes. Luckily, a lot of that has worn off, and the season premiere is devoted to Grace\u2019s flirtatious and contentious obsession with a neighbor whose Twitter handle is \u201cWestside Curmudgeon.\u201d David Schwimmer plays that neighbor, and he and Debra Messing have a terrifically punchy chemistry that bodes well for his five-episode guest arc.\u201cPushing Daisies\u201d is completely enchanting, in its quirky premise, in its winking dialogue, and especially in its colorful, retro-tinged aesthetics, as if \u201cEdward Scissorhands\u201d were happy, or \u201cLittle Shop of Horrors\u201d weren\u2019t about poverty. Lee Pace stars as Ned, a pie maker with a secret gift: He can bring dead things back to life with his touch. But they can only be revived for one minute \u2014 he has to touch them again to return them to their eternal slumber \u2014 or else one person or creature in the immediate vicinity dies. He uses this talent to revive his childhood sweetheart, Chuck (Anna Friel), but he can\u2019t bring himself to end her life for good. (Sorry, nearby funeral director.) Thus they begin a beautiful, tender romance where they can never, ever touch.\u201cDaisies\u201d is as sweet as they come, as whimsical and fully realized as a show can be. Even though Ned helps solve murders, the show is light and loving, and the fairy-tale narration by Jim Dale, whose voice some viewers might recognize from the \u201cHarry Potter\u201d audiobooks, makes everything even dreamier.Might you have guessed that \u201cPushing Daisies\u201d was canceled after two short seasons? Of course it was. There are only 22 episodes, so watch slowly. I love this show so much that I have never watched the series finale, even though it aired in 2009. I just like knowing there\u2019s one more episode out there, that the show is not over for me just yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Homecoming\u2019 Is Military, Industrial and Complex", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt has the cool tone, the paranoia, the visual flourishes, the mind-bending revelations. But these effects are concentrated on a single, intricate story, laid out in 10 swift and magnetic episodes.In this case, less is very much more.The plot, of which it is best to say little, involves the corporatization of government, a favorite subject of \u201cMr. Robot.\u201d Heidi Bergman (Julia Roberts) has just started work as a counselor at the Homecoming center, a privately run facility for the reintegration of combat veterans, where she sees clients like Walter Cruz (Stephan James), a wry, good-natured veteran struggling with survivor\u2019s guilt.The Homecoming facility, set in a drab office park somewhere in Florida, is just there to help soldiers get on with life. You\u2019ll quickly supply the \u201c \u2026 or is it?\u201d yourself. In between sessions, Heidi fields hectoring calls from her boss, Colin Belfast (Bobby Cannavale), an executive for the Geist Group, the company running Homecoming. He is more interested in extracting \u201cdata\u201d from the vets, for some unknown purpose, than helping them.Esmail\u2019s signature style leaps at you immediately: the god\u2019s-eye overhead shots, the image composition that puts you productively off-balance, the screen titles bigger than your living room.But the abundance of style serves the substance, creating an atmosphere of room-tone menace. Everything about the Homecoming center is bland and minimalist \u2014 \u201chip but masculine,\u201d Colin calls the d\u00e9cor \u2014 and \u201cHomecoming\u201d understands that anonymous spaces, euphemism and depersonalized corporate-speak can be more terrifying than any jump scare.The most striking visual choice is the screen itself. The Homecoming scenes, set in 2018, are presented in typical wide-screen format. A second story line, four years in the future, is set off by black bars that squeeze the frame claustrophobically.In this future, Heidi is living with her mother (Sissy Spacek) and waiting tables at a dump of a restaurant. A customer, Thomas Carrasco (Shea Whigham) identifies himself as an auditor from the Department of Defense, investigating a complaint about Homecoming. Sorry, Heidi tells him; she has no memory of ever working there.In an age of streaming-TV bloat, \u201cHomecoming\u201d is five efficient hours, about 30 minutes per episode. It manages to be deliberative and propulsive at the same time. It builds momentum even as the first few episodes may seem to meander, and it comes together in a suspenseful thriller with an emotional punch.The series is adapted from a podcast by Horowitz and Bloomberg, which presented its story in a telegraphic, found-audio format: phone conversations, taped counseling sessions, voice messages. This version finds a TV correlative for that approach, constructing itself largely as a series of conversations.Its heart is the sessions between Cruz and Heidi, who develop a warm, work-spouse relationship. Roberts harks back here to her crusader-whistleblower roles (\u201cErin Brockovich,\u201d \u201cThe Pelican Brief\u201d), but with a reserved, layered performance. Heidi needs to work and wants to do good, and she realizes, with slowly dawning horror, that those aims are in conflict.Cannavale breathes pushy life into Colin, who\u2019s introduced as a stressed-out voice in split-screen phone conversations. Even when he interacts with other principals in the flesh, he\u2019s basically a human Bluetooth headset, a mouthy, Mametian bulldozer spewing coach-speak: \u201cHeidi, you are killing it! Fist bump!\u201dJames and Whigham are also impressive in more understated roles. James brings an easy charisma to a character who\u2019s designed to be a puzzle. And Whigham (the blustery Eli in \u201cBoardwalk Empire\u201d), as an introvert more at home digging through file folders than confronting suspects, makes a terrific hero-nerd.It takes a bureaucrat, after all, to uncover a crime of bureaucracy, if that\u2019s what\u2019s afoot here. Like the tech-focused \u201cMr. Robot,\u201d \u201cHomecoming\u201d is about the relation of individuals to corrupted systems. It may only take one villain to conceive an ill deed, but when it\u2019s legitimized through the machinery of government and business, it becomes the work of many hands, like Heidi\u2019s.Often those people do what the soldiers treated at Homecoming do: They repress; they deflect; they crate up their feelings in a box. They tell themselves what Heidi\u2019s mother tells her: \u201cPeople make compromises. You did what you had to do. You took a job.\u201dPart of what \u201cHomecoming\u201d asks is: How responsible do you have to be for a thing before you\u2019re morally responsible for it? How high up in an organization?In \u201cHomecoming,\u201d business is war by other means. And beyond its slickness and deft puzzle-story twists, this series is a perceptive study of the collateral damage.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Saltier the Licorice, the Happier the Country. Just Look at Finland.", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers.

The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world.

Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate.

But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year.

Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan.

It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times.

At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Can Hasan Minhaj Make Topical Comedy Work on Netflix?", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "With \u201cPatriot Act,\u201d the former \u201cDaily Show\u201d correspondent plans to cover news most late-night hosts ignore, and looks to defy Netflix\u2019s spotty talk show track record.Supported byThe test show that Minhaj was about to perform \u2014 a 24-minute monologue about the role of Asian-Americans in reshaping affirmative action, and a 10-minute piece about digital security in Estonia \u2014 could very well end up looking like a \u201cwoke TED Talk,\u201d he said.Good or bad, it was the show he always wanted to make and \u201cI\u2019m going to give you everything I have,\u201d Minhaj said.He added, \u201cCulturally, for us, I think we need something like this.\u201d\u201cWe\u201d here could mean the racially diverse group that had come to see Minhaj, who often talks in his act about his identity as a Muslim and a child of Indian immigrant parents. It could refer to the demographic of viewers in their 20s and 30s that Netflix would love to see him bring to the streaming service. Or it might be anyone who has tired of \u201cDaily Show\u201d clones and is eager for anything even slightly different.But even if Minhaj and his colleagues have cracked the code and created a genuinely new kind of topical comedy, is there an audience for it? And is Netflix the place where it belongs?If the post-Jon Stewart era of television once looked like a potential paradise for any host with a political perspective and a few zingers about the Trump administration, it is now a battlefield littered with casualties.Maybe there\u2019s no way for topical comedy to succeed on streaming TV and maybe Minhaj is doomed before he starts. But Minhaj doesn\u2019t see it this way.\u201cIf we get this wrong, well, it\u2019s what everyone predicted,\u201d he told me a few days before the test show. \u201cBut if we get this right?\u201d His eyes widened and a grin spread across his face. \u201cIt feels like \u2018Rocky\u2019 1 all over again.\u201dOn an earlier morning in September, Minhaj and about 20 of his \u201cPatriot Act\u201d colleagues were in the bowels of their midtown Manhattan office, gathered around an enormous TV (and a basket of croissants) for what they called a \u201cpre-viz\u201d meeting.The monitor showed a computer rendering of the \u201cPatriot Act\u201d stage, on which stood a small digital silhouette of Minhaj. The flesh-and-blood comedian was sitting on a couch, dressed in athleisure clothes and a pair of Air Jordans as he read from the script for his affirmative action monologue.On screen, bar graphs rose and fell like roller coasters and pie charts exploded into existence while Minhaj recited admissions figures for elite colleges. (Noting that Caltech had nine black students in 2012, he quipped, \u201cThere are more black people in the Wu-Tang Clan.\u201d)Amid the deluge of data and punch lines, Minhaj was also weaving a personal story: one of growing up a proud first-generation American in Davis, Calif., while navigating a murky ecosystem of race and class.In his college-prep classes, Minhaj said, he was told not to declare himself an Asian on his application forms or he\u2019d risk the penalty of a possible racial quota.\u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t going to get into Stanford because some black kid was going to take my spot,\u201d he said in the monologue. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get into Stanford because I was dumb.\u201d (This is his modest way of saying he cracked 1300 on his SAT exam.)On paper, Minhaj is very much a grown-up: a husband of three years to his wife, Beena, a management consultant, and father to their daughter, who was born in March. But in person, he has a childlike buoyancy, kept aloft by his lifelong loves of hip-hop and professional basketball and his occasional tendency to talk like an internet meme come to life. He\u2019ll say aloud a phrase like \u201ctools\u2192clear history\u201d when he means he\u2019s trying to put something out of his mind.In late 2014, he was hired as a \u201cDaily Show\u201d correspondent. \u201cHe was just undeniable,\u201d Jon Stewart said of him. \u201cI can teach the false-news correspondent mechanics, but not the singularity of someone\u2019s talent. When you get somebody like that, who\u2019s a great storyteller, introspective and humble, you just go: \u2018O.K. We\u2019re done. He\u2019s good.\u2019\u201dOnly a few months later, Stewart announced his departure from the program. Minhaj said he couldn\u2019t forget his admired boss\u2019s explanation for why he was leaving: \u201cJon was like, \u2018I\u2019ve manipulated this chess piece in every single way I could. There\u2019s no further place that I can take it.\u2019\u201d The message to Minhaj was clear, even then, that he had to start thinking about his own next moves.When Trevor Noah took over at \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Minhaj was seen as something of a curiosity there. \u201cHasan was intrinsically different from all of the caricatures and archetypes of what \u2018Daily Show\u2019 correspondents had been,\u201d Noah told me. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t snide, he wasn\u2019t sarcastic \u2014 he was just a different person.\u201dHis breakout opportunities arrived elsewhere. First was his one-man show, \u201cHomecoming King,\u201d which he started performing live in 2014 and released as a Netflix special last year. It is his exuberant recitation of his origin story, of learning the ropes from his father (while his mother studied at medical school in India) and confronting bias and bigotry in America.\u201cHomecoming King\u201d also established a signature visual style for Minhaj\u2019s stage show, full of vivid digital graphics and screencaps from social media. It led to his invitation to host the White House Correspondents Dinner at perhaps the worst possible moment, when President Trump had already announced he would not attend, media organizations were questioning whether the event should even go forward and Minhaj said he knew the gig was \u201cradioactive.\u201d\u201cHow far down the totem pole do you have to go to be like, \u2018Let\u2019s get the second- or third-most popular correspondent on \u2018The Daily Show\u2019?\u2019\u201d he said.Minhaj knew that he\u2019d been underestimated and he used this to his advantage. He delivered a stirring routine that was less a taunting of Trump officials than a reminder to the journalists watching of the weighty responsibility facing them.\u201cIn the age of Trump,\u201d he said in his speech, \u201cI know that you guys have to be more perfect now more than ever. Because you are how the president gets his news.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou can\u2019t make any mistakes. Because when one of you messes up, he blames your entire group. And now you know what it feels like to be a minority.\u201dLooking back on the experience over lunch at a Greek restaurant near his office, Minhaj told me this was a pivotal career moment, not because he got good reviews or because he resisted the advice of fellow comedians who told him he had to (metaphorically) burn the room down.What he learned that night \u2014 though he\u2019d already suspected as much \u2014 was that he wasn\u2019t a slinger of one-liners so much as a designer of narratives. \u201cI want to be surgical,\u201d Minhaj said. \u201cI want to build to a moment.\u201dWhen Netflix pursued him, in the afterglow of the White House Correspondents Dinner, to create a series for them, Minhaj had a very clear sense of what he didn\u2019t want to do.He took out his phone and showed me a series of photos from other late-night shows \u2014 all the hosts you\u2019d expect \u2014 seated at their desks in identical poses with graphics placed in identical locations above their shoulders.His voice was uncharacteristically ferocious as he swiped through the photos. \u201cIt. Doesn\u2019t. Matter. The. Network. It all. Stays. The same. I swear. To. God,\u201d Minhaj said.If he didn\u2019t assert himself and find his own approach, he said, \u201cI was going to be in a suit, behind a desk, in front of a fake city skyline, and people would be, like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s Indian John Oliver.\u2019\u201dIn their international travels, Minhaj and his collaborators were seeing \u201cHomecoming King\u201d and his correspondents dinner performance connect with a global viewership.Prashanth Venkataramanujam, a fellow comedian and longtime friend who worked with Minhaj on these routines, said they began to devise a plan for tapping into this underrepresented audience.\u201cHow do we talk about subjects that just don\u2019t normally make it into the mainstream conversation?\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the ability to find a thesis and then work our way backwards from it.\u201dThe news stories he should focus on, Minhaj said, were the ones in which he felt some sense of personal investment. \u201cNot, do I have a take?\u201d he said. \u201cBut do I have the best take? I have no desire to be the 19th hyena jumping on the carcass. Do I have something of value to add? Then let\u2019s do it.\u201dOver a period of months, Minhaj workshopped some routines (like the one about affirmative action) at the Fat Black Pussycat in Manhattan. He spent his own money to produce a proof-of-concept video for \u201cPatriot Act\u201d \u2014 essentially, a rough pilot episode that he could show to Netflix and other broadcasters.It closely approximates how Minhaj intends to present \u201cPatriot Act\u201d now: with him always standing and in perpetual motion \u2014 no desk to sit behind, no chair to sit on \u2014 surrounded at all times by graphics, data and video.Netflix ordered 32 episodes of the series, which will be released in cycles of six to eight weekly episodes. Even now, in the days before its first episodes are released, Minhaj was still deciding whether one long monologue was enough content for an entire show or if viewers would also want another shorter, less substantive segment (a \u201cwine pairing\u201d to go with their \u201csteak,\u201d as he put it).Minhaj\u2019s comedy peers believe that he has as good a shot as anyone at finding a new approach to this well-worn genre. But no one is in denial about the challenges he faces, either.\u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to hit and what\u2019s not going to,\u201d Jon Stewart said, but when it came to Minhaj, \u201cI\u2019d buy that raffle ticket any day of the week.\u201dThough other recent shows with promising hosts had been short-lived, Stewart said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it says anything about the talent of the individuals. If you told me, \u2018I\u2019m going to let Jordan Klepper or Robin Thede or Michelle Wolf do what they do,\u2019 I\u2019d be like, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s a smart choice.\u2019\u201dHe added, \u201cI hate to see things get pulled before they\u2019ve fully developed their voice and figured out who they are, and I thought they all showed a worthiness to continue. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m not a network executive.\u201dLarry Wilmore, the longtime \u201cDaily Show\u201d correspondent and former \u201cNightly Show\u201d host, said he wondered if the audiences for these comedy shows had already made their choices and their viewing habits were fixed in place.\u201cThere is just a lot of that type of content out there,\u201d Wilmore said. \u201cThere are already trusted outlets for it. They\u2019re home cooking for a lot of people.\u201dIn an oversaturated market, Wilmore said, audiences would be won not by pioneering formats but memorable personalities, and he certainly considered Minhaj to be such a performer.\u201cThe people who are coming to his shows are doing it in exhilaration \u2014 \u2018Finally, somebody like us is doing this,\u2019\u201d he said of Minhaj. \u201cI think that\u2019s very meaningful.\u201dRobin Thede, the former \u201cNightly Show\u201d head writer and host of \u201cThe Rundown,\u201d said that there was still ample room for a show that did not focus on the day-in, day-out spectacle of the Trump presidency. \u201cI think people are tired of hearing about Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re for Trump or against Trump, everyone\u2019s exhausted.\u201dAchieving diversity in the field is still a crucial goal, Thede said: \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s still at least three men who were born with the name James who host late-night shows.\u201dBut broadcasters also have to recognize the long-term commitments required to make these programs viable.She added, \u201cAny talk show needs a couple years to find their voice but a lot of places can\u2019t afford that luxury. It\u2019s all niche, really.\u201dTo many viewers, the very idea of a comedy show drawn from news and events happening right this moment seems to contradict the fundamental proposition that streaming platforms are offering.\u201cThe whole point is that they liberated us from appointments,\u201d Noah said. \u201cIt\u2019s like McDonald\u2019s saying, \u2018Hey, would you like to wait 30 minutes for your food?\u2019\u201dNetflix still aspires to have its own breakthrough topical comedy series. \u201cWe\u2019d like to aspire to be best in class in programming, in every category,\u201d Bajaria said. With a sardonic chuckle, she added, \u201cAnd we do like a challenge.\u201dBut she acknowledged there were still challenges in selling Netflix viewers on these shows. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent all this time saying, \u2018Come at any point to the platform, watch whenever you want,\u2019\u201d Bajaria said. \u201cIn this category, we\u2019re saying there\u2019s a timeliness and trying to drive viewers on a weekly basis, which is different.\u201dBut Bajaria said each series is its own proposition. In the case of \u201cThe Break With Michelle Wolf,\u201d she said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of factors that we take into consideration, obviously, when we\u2019re not renewing a series. It didn\u2019t find as large of an audience as we would have hoped. She\u2019s very talented and we hope she felt really supported, making the show she wanted to make.\u201d (Wolf declined to comment for this article.)Netflix is hoping that Minhaj\u2019s ethnicity and his personal compass for news stories will help him reach viewers in the other 190 or so countries outside the United States where it is offered, and it plans to promote the show heavily on YouTube and social media.The success of \u201cPatriot Act,\u201d Bajaria said, would be measured by its viewership figures (which Netflix doesn\u2019t make public) as well as its ability to insinuate itself into the zeitgeist (which no one has yet figured out how to quantify).\u201cDo you have something to say?\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have a fresh way to say this? We really think Hasan\u2019s P.O.V. and his take on things can cut through.\u201dA short time after the \u201cpre-viz\u201d meeting, Minhaj was in his office at \u201cPatriot Act,\u201d his Air Jordans propped up on his desk near a Mike Bibby bobblehead. On a dry-erase board in front of him was a rough outline for an episode he hoped to perform about Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Attached to a corkboard behind him were notecards with other topics for future exploration: \u201cAmazon and antitrust\u201d; \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d; \u201cMyanmar/Rohingya.\u201dHe had to make his choices shrewdly: every segment he commits to means months of work for his news research, writing and graphics departments, a staff of about 74 people total.Minhaj said he was determined that \u201cPatriot Act\u201d not come out of the gate looking like \u201cthis open mic that Netflix is paying for as we figure it out.\u201d He could still remember the day he learned that Wolf\u2019s and McHale\u2019s shows were both canceled and how it ratcheted up the pressure on his project.As he recalled it, \u201cPrashanth walked into my office and he could see that I was definitely stressed. He goes, \u2018Remember, this is how you felt during the correspondents dinner.\u2019 It\u2019s this massive question mark \u2014 what is going to happen?\u201dAt his test show a few weeks later, in a rare moment when he wasn\u2019t feverishly delivering his affirmative action monologue or guzzling down gulps of water when the camera wasn\u2019t on him, Minhaj paused to reflect on a joke he had told earlier.He\u2019d played a series of clips from interviews with Edward Blum, the conservative activist, in which he variously claimed that Harvard had a precise quota of 17, 19 or 15 percent for Asians in its incoming freshman class.After the videos, Minhaj mocked Blum, telling him he should have studied harder at Kumon, the boot-camp education franchise that is especially popular with Asian immigrant families.The line had got some laughter, and Minhaj was proud of that. He told the audience, \u201cAll the writers were like, \u2018I don\u2019t know if the Kumon joke is going to hit. It\u2019s, like, so nerdy.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Trust me \u2014 it\u2019s going to hit.\u2019\u201dAnd he was right. It was just one choice, but it was his choice and he was happy with it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Some Amazon Workers Are Fuming About Their Raise", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs soon as he said \u201cnew Amazon minimum wage of $15 an hour,\u201d Mr. Clark was drowned out by more than 10 seconds of cheers and high-fives.But in Amazon warehouses across the country, many longtime workers are fuming that \u2014 based on the information they have received so far \u2014 they may end up making thousands of dollars less a year.Yes, Amazon is increasing wages, which will benefit most employees. But it will no longer give out new stock grants and monthly bonuses. Some workers believe that means their total compensation will shrink.Whether Amazon finds a way to close that gap will be closely watched in Washington. On Thursday, Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont, sent a letter to Jay Carney, who runs Amazon\u2019s public policy, \u201casking Amazon to confirm how the total compensation of employees who would have received stock options \u2014 those with the company for two or more years \u2014 will be affected as a result of the recent changes,\u201d according to a copy provided to The New York Times.Mr. Sanders, who was alerted to the issue by workers, has not yet received a response from Amazon, a spokesman for the senator said.The New York Times spoke to about a half-dozen workers around the country, from Texas to Kentucky, and viewed numerous employee discussions on Facebook. All of the workers shared their pay stubs, but few would allow their names to be used.Near Minneapolis, Katy Iber, who handles returned products at an Amazon warehouse, works the night shift. Her region has a tight local labor market, so she already makes more than $15 an hour.In an \u201call hands\u201d meeting at the start of her shift on Thursday \u2014 her first day at work after the pay raise was announced \u2014 she learned Amazon was raising her base pay by $1 an hour.But it was also ending monthly attendance and productivity bonuses, known as the Variable Compensation Plan, or V.C.P. And she would no longer be granted valuable Amazon shares. The trade-off meant she\u2019d be losing money, she said.It was as though the company were saying: \u201c\u2018Thanks, we appreciate you going into the holidays. Here\u2019s less money,\u2019\u201d Ms. Iber said. The Times reached Ms. Iber through the Awood Center, a nonprofit that is organizing East African workers in the region.Amazon maintained in a statement that the higher hourly wage \u201cmore than compensates for the phaseout\u201d of the stock and incentive bonuses. A traditional pay raise, the company said, is \u201cmore immediate and predictable.\u201dAmazon said more than 250,000 employees and an additional 100,000 seasonal workers would benefit from the pay changes, and announced similar changes for workers in Britain. Deutsche Bank estimated that Amazon\u2019s pay increase \u201crepresents less than 1 percent of its projected 2019 revenue.\u201dFor many workers, including those who work part time and were never eligible for stock and bonuses, the raises in base pay will certainly put more cash in their pockets.Amazon officials said that over the next week they would adjust the pay of some employees to make sure workers did not end up losing money with the changes.The difference between what some employees believe is their total compensation and what the company believes they are being paid also may come down to accounting rules. Amazon said that if employees in 2018 get stock that was granted to them two years ago, that legally counts as compensation this year. But some employees believe that was compensation for work done two years ago.The difference \u2014 whether because of miscommunication or incomplete information given to employees \u2014 has resonated in Amazon warehouses around the country, particularly with employees with a longer tenure at the company.The dispute is over two compensation programs that will end on Nov. 1. The first, the Variable Compensation Plan, is paid out each month. It offered up to a 4 percent bonus for attendance, and an additional 4 percent if a worker\u2019s building met certain production goals.Ms. Iber said someone in her warehouse wrote \u201cBRING BACK VCP!!!!\u201d on a whiteboard where employees are encouraged to communicate with management.In the three months around the holiday season, known as \u201cdouble down,\u201d the bonus doubles, meaning employees could earn as much as 16 percent on top of their regular wages.The second program gave employees shares in Amazon stock each year. They get to keep the shares if they\u2019re still working at the company after two years. Recently, employees have been getting two shares, worth about a combined $3,725 at the current market value. With the changes, workers get to keep the stock granted in previous years but will not earn new shares.Documentation that Ms. Iber provided showed that her bonus amounted to $1.28 an hour in August. In the three months around the holidays, that could be more than $2.50 an hour, far more than the $1-an-hour increase in base pay she\u2019s getting.She is down even more when stock grants are taken into account. She will keep old shares but will not be granted new ones.In a Facebook group popular with employees, workers fumed over the changes, according to screenshots from the page that were viewed by The Times.There were so many negative pending posts on the day Amazon announced the $15 wage that a moderator wrote that she had deleted them and pleaded with workers to write to the corporate offices in Seattle rather than vent online.Another poster wrote that her co-workers were contemplating a walkout on Black Friday, the big shopping day after Thanksgiving, and others said they were saddened to lose the sense of ownership that the stock compensation provided.Workers said the timing of the change, just as bonuses double for the holiday season, stings. Ms. Iber said a co-worker had told her that he regretted paying down some credit card debt in anticipation of the extra holiday bonus. He worried that without the extra holiday pay, he won\u2019t be able to cover his regular monthly bills.She could sympathize. Last year, Ms. Iber used the holiday season bonuses to pay for insulation in her attic. She was going to get a new water heater this year, but now she\u2019s holding off. She said that she would wait for the heater to break, and that when it did, she\u2019d put the repairs on a credit card.An earlier version of this article incorrectly described a benefit formerly provided by Amazon to its full-time employees. The company offered restricted stock units, which are stock grants that vest over time, not stock options, which are the right to purchase shares at a specific price.Advertisement"}

But many have read Mr. Marmo\u2019s performance as a commentary on the Trump era.Mr. Marmo sees similarities to his subject\u2019s era: Free speech is once again under attack, Americans are divided over race and religion and protesters crowd city streets and the halls of Congress.\u201cLenny Bruce is more relevant than ever when you consider the state of the country,\u201d Mr. Marmo said. \u201cHis biggest thing was he hated hypocrisy.\u201dHad he lived, Mr. Bruce would be turning 93 on Saturday. But his ideas continue to provoke.He followed his mother, the comedian Sally Marr, into life as a standup.In 1951, Mr. Bruce married a stripper and moved to Hollywood, where he played the burlesque clubs. (They later divorced.) But it wasn\u2019t until the late 1950s that he earned a reputation as a spontaneous linguist who connected ideas and words in a style reminiscent of jazz musicians.The Times described Mr. Bruce in 1959 as \u201ca four-button mongoose\u201d imbued with a streak of moral indignation. \u201cThe kind of comedy I do isn\u2019t, like, going to change the world,\u201d Mr. Bruce said in the interview. \u201cBut certain areas of society makes me unhappy, and satirizing them \u2014 aside from being lucrative \u2014 provides a release for me.\u201dMr. Bruce\u2019s act was meant to render racially charged language meaningless, Mr. Marmo said. Even now it has the opposite effect. \u201cOne black woman in the back of room stood up and said, \u201cThat\u2019s what we are doing now?\u201d the actor recalled. \u201cI have the audience talk to me all the time.\u201dHis court battles became a financial drain and hurt his ability to book shows, and in 1966 Mr. Bruce died from a morphine overdose in the bathroom of his Hollywood Hills home.In the play, the main character, Ron, seeks to perform a routine in the style of Mr. Bruce but faces student protests.The irony of having his play canceled by Brandeis, his alma mater, was not lost on Mr. Weller, whose other credits include the movie scripts for \u201cHair\u201d and \u201cRagtime.\u201d \u201cPart of the point of the play is that there are these political eruptions that start with something small and inadvertent,\u201d he said.Ms. Bruce said it took a long time to come to terms with the notion that her father\u2019s comedy would be interpreted by others. \u201cI was always terribly uncomfortable with people doing his material,\u201d she said. \u201cI can say, now, I\u2019m really happy that they are.

{"Headline": "Selling Donald Trump: A First-Time Campaign Manager Tries to Defy the Doubters", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Brad Parscale, the campaign manager for President Trump\u2019s planned re-election effort in 2020, has never run another political race of any kind. Republican establishment figures are watching him closely, in some cases quietly hoping he stumbles. And he is working for a famously mercurial boss whose 2016 campaign had three shake-ups over six months.But Mr. Parscale believes he is the man for the moment, uniquely equipped to manage the potentially fractious relationships inside the campaign and sell voters on the idea of sticking with an unorthodox president.\u201cI might not be the right choice for everyone, but I am the right choice for him,\u201d Mr. Parscale said.Mr. Parscale, 42, is a professional marketer, and he plans to retain that approach \u2014 one preferred by Mr. Trump, himself the marketer in chief \u2014 heading into 2020. Mr. Parscale acknowledges the gaps in his political curriculum vitae, but says that he has filled some of them, and will enlist the help of political professionals to close the rest.\u201cI would say my weakness is the political encyclopedia, but I don\u2019t think it matters that much for what Trump needs,\u201d he said in a recent interview.Mr. Parscale was the campaign\u2019s digital director in 2016, when Mr. Trump gleefully tossed out much of that political playbook. While Mr. Trump delivered his blunt-force outsider message directly to voters through Twitter, Mr. Parscale integrated Facebook into the campaign to reach millions with finely tuned appeals.\u201cHe knows how to do it in a Trumpian way,\u201d Mr. Kushner said in a brief interview. \u201cHe has the president\u2019s trust and the trust of the family. I can\u2019t think of a better person to run the campaign.\u201dMr. Parscale, a 6-foot-8 native of Kansas whom the president jokingly refers to as an \u201cAmazon,\u201d has developed a rhythm around Mr. Trump, waiting to present and then re-present ideas that he believes in but that the president has vetoed before. On other issues, he is given the freedom to make decisions without seeking nonstop inputs, and execute on them quickly, making him an anomaly in the Trump sphere.The autonomy is a byproduct of knowing he usually has the faith of the family. And that relationship appears to explain why he seems unconcerned by the nagging questions, asked in private by Trump insiders and veteran operatives, about how long he will hold the role, given Mr. Trump\u2019s volatile style.Mr. Parscale said that one of his main roles on the campaign has been to be the person found objectionable by the fewest people. \u201cThe most amazing thing I\u2019ve done is kept everybody from attacking each other,\u201d said Mr. Parscale, a garrulous man who exudes nervous energy. \u201cI\u2019m the cog in the middle that makes it all turn together. And if you pull me out, a lot of other cogs start to fall.\u201dBut his management of those relationships has also had a few bumps \u2014 some in Mr. Trump\u2019s orbit believe he has become too much of a public face, including his aggressive Twitter persona and his participation in a flattering profile on \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d A recent photo he posted on Twitter of himself with Eric Trump aboard a private plane, flashing a gold watch, drew widespread scorn; Mr. Parscale said he was simply having fun with a friend, and wearing a watch that he had inherited from his father.Several prominent Republicans and some of Mr. Parscale\u2019s former colleagues on the 2016 race \u2014 all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal \u2014 suggested that he might face strong headwinds atop the campaign, given his own inexperience and the desire among political professionals and some of his own colleagues to see him fail.While Mr. Parscale\u2019s connection to the Trump family began years ago with web design work, he bristles at being labeled merely a web designer and notes that his background is in internet marketing, and that the digital strategy he oversaw has been credited by Republicans with helping Mr. Trump win.His company at the time, Giles Parscale, took in more than $90 million from the campaign, the bulk of which went to online advertising \u2014 a sum that enraged Mr. Trump, at least before he won. Since then, Mr. Parscale\u2019s new company, Parscale Strategy, has received six- and seven-figure payments by the Trump campaign, the Republican National Committee and the super PAC supporting the president.It is not clear how much money goes to Mr. Parscale directly; he maintains it is a small percentage.None of Mr. Parscale\u2019s critics were willing to speak on the record, a reflection of the power that he now wields. By contrast, top Republicans wanted to demonstrate support: The Republican National Committee chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, said she was in lock step with him, and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 2 House Republican, called himself a \u201cbig fan\u201d and said that Mr. Parscale had shown it was time to abandon the orthodoxy of how campaigns should be run.He tends to think in headline-making concepts, but sometimes Mr. Parscale has failed to consider the potential problems of an unconventional approach. When Roseanne Barr was fired from her ABC show over a racist Twitter post, Mr. Parscale mused about the possibility that she be invited to appear alongside Mr. Trump at his campaign rally later that night. Others quickly rejected the idea. When the acrimonious relationship between Mr. Trump and his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, reached one of its lowest points, Mr. Parscale jumped into the fray on Twitter, denouncing the cabinet secretary in deeply personal terms and calling for his dismissal, to the dismay of some White House officials.Yet Mr. Parscale also sees the benefits at times of a more conventional approach. He was unnerved by Mr. Trump\u2019s recent Twitter post describing Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film star known as Stormy Daniels, as \u201cHorseface,\u201d according to several people. And Trump allies say Mr. Parscale, like his boss, is far less confrontational in person than the Twitter persona he has created.Mike Shields, a veteran Republican strategist and a former chief of staff of the Republican National Committee, cautioned that the political establishment was making a mistake by waiting for Mr. Parscale to slip up.\u201cPeople in the political sphere are going to underestimate him, and that really benefits him,\u201d Mr. Shields said.\u201cFor years, data and digital operatives in both parties have been fighting to move up from the basement in campaigns to have a seat at the decision-making table,\u201d added Mr. Shields. \u201cIt took President Trump to finally make it happen \u2014 he put a digital marketer in the ultimate position in politics.\u201dMr. Parscale is beginning to staff the campaign, and he expects to get off to a quicker start than previous presidential re-election efforts.Chris Carr, the former party committee political director, will be political director for the campaign. Katrina Pierson, a longtime Trump political aide, and Andy Surabian, a former campaign aide who then worked in the White House, have been hired as advisers. Justin Clark, who was the 2016 deputy political director, and Bill Stepien, who was the national field director, are expected to leave the White House and join the campaign in some capacity. Mr. Clark now leads the Office of Public Liaison, and Mr. Stepien is the White House political director.In the 2016 campaign, Mr. Parscale worked with the party committee at a time of enmity between the two camps. He forged a close working relationship with the party committee\u2019s chief of staff at the time, Katie Walsh, who is married to Mr. Shields, and who still advises the party committee.This time around, the resources will be structured from the start, with communications and digital operations housed at the campaign, in Arlington, Va., and the political, fund-raising and data operations at the party committee headquarters.Mr. Parscale divides his time between Virginia and Florida, where he has purchased personal office space. He insists that he wants to be a low-key presence.\u201cInside Trump world,\u201d Mr. Parscale said, he stays out of the center of attention \u201cbetter than anybody.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A 12th-Century Relic Meets 21st-Century Technology", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGrace notesCurators enlisted a drone to survey damage to the Fuentidue\u00f1a apse, which dates to the 12th century, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Cloisters in Northern Manhattan.Soon the Met will have a condition report on another object in its collection, an object that happens to be very large \u2014 more than 30 feet wide and more than 24 feet tall. But size is not the only reason the Met could not simply send this particular object to its in-house studio to be photographed, as it does with nearly everything else.This particular object is outdoors.So the Met did something it had never done for a condition report. It turned to a 21st century gadget \u2014 a drone.It was rebuilt on a hillside above the Hudson River, a relic from the Middle Ages that was transplanted in the mid-20th century. And last week, it came face to face with a 21st-century drone carrying a $50,000-or-so camera.It is also different because it has been examined by chemists, engineers, geologists and biologists over the years, all \u201ctrying to do a diagnosis of the weathering damage of the stone,\u201d she said.\u201cWe\u2019ve been following this stone like a patient,\u201d she said, and there is reason for the concern. The apse was made with two types of limestone. One is so porous that Ms. Karg\u00e8re said it \u201cimbibes\u201d water.The drone survey will let Ms. Karg\u00e8re compare the drone photographs to images taken in the 1990s. The drone made it easier to see into high-up crevices and peer at the figures on the corbels, the brackets just under the roofline. Sunny weather helped, too. The survey in the 1990s was done in late winter. \u201cEveryone was freezing,\u201d Barbara Bridgers, the head of imaging for the Met, recalled.This time around, the drone was sitting in the cobblestone driveway behind the apse, not far from a tent that had been set up as Mission Control. \u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re walking into a James Bond set,\u201d one Met official said, looking at the paraphernalia \u2014 a laptop, a portable monitor and extra batteries for the drone and the camera. A fully charged battery keeps the drone flying for about 20 minutes.Dan Wang, a photographer who works for the camera maker Hasselblad, stood over the laptop. He was wearing an earpiece with a microphone, the kind that security guards wear when they talk into their sleeves, except that his microphone was pinned to his shirt.\u201cSpin it,\u201d Mr. Wang said. The drone whooshed to life. \u201cProps up,\u201d he said. \u201cStand by.\u201dThe drone beeped \u2014 happily, apparently. Then Mr. Kostakis guided it off the ground.\u201cBird\u2019s up,\u201d Mr. Wang said into his shirt. \u201cLet\u2019s start high to low.\u201dThe idea was for the drone to rise about 30 feet, almost to the top of the apse, hover about 12 feet out from the wall and work its way down, with the camera snapping photos along the way. Mr. Wang tapped a touch-screen and the camera took a picture of the wall. Mr. Kostakis slid it a little to the left, then a little up, on orders from Mr. Wang, before he tapped the touch-screen again.The result will be thousands of images that will overlap. Software will knit them together.For Ms. Karg\u00e8re and the Met\u2019s photographers, the drone survey was faster than climbing up on a ladder. It did not take weeks, as a survey with a cherry picker did in the 1990s, and they did not have to think about putting up scaffolding for extreme close-ups.Also, because all of the images were taken on the same day, the light was more consistent. Light always matters to art curators, and if there\u2019s a question about whether the stone is deteriorating, curators will not have to contend with day-to-day variations in light, as they did in the past.As Mr. Kostakis drove the drone, Met officials stood at a distance, and inevitably, the conversation was about contrasts \u2014 the contrast between the 12th-century apse and the modern technology circling it, and the contrast between this survey and the one in the 1990s. Ms. Bridgers said the 1990s survey was done with the Met\u2019s first digital camera. She said the images were saved as 24 megabyte files. The images from the camera on the drone take up almost 17 times the space.Ms. Karg\u00e8re was not thinking about drones when she requested the survey. \u201cLucretia asked me if we could do a repeat of the cherry-picker process,\u201d Ms. Bridgers recalled.Soon a constellation of thoughts formed in her mind: \u201cLucretia, Cloisters, drone, Hasselblad, apse.\u201d She asked the Hasselblad officials about sending up a drone to survey the apse. \u201cTheir eyes lit up,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThey said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201dFrom a layperson\u2019s point of view \u2014 say, the perspective of the people walking around the Cloisters who pulled out their cellphones when they saw the drone ascending \u2014 doing a survey that way might seem gimmicky. For the curators, it is not.\u201cWe need to understand the nature of the stone,\u201d Ms. Karg\u00e8re said. \u201cWe want from this documentation a diagnosis of what\u2019s happening. Looking at the photographs, we\u2019ll see patterns. We\u2019ll look at how they\u2019ve evolved.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Creating a Standout Vacation Rental ", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHE FIXHow to furnish a space that will attract guests \u2014 and withstand the wear and tear that comes with them.Renting out a vacation home \u2014 or even a spare room in your apartment in the city \u2014 is easier than ever, thanks to sites like Airbnb and HomeAway. But making your rental stand out in a crowd of online listings is another thing.And even if you manage to attract guests, how do you decorate a space so that it withstands the damage that even the best behaved among them will do? We asked interior designers with rental homes of their own for advice.At his rental \u2014 a three-bedroom, three-bathroom house that rents for $175,000 a summer \u2014 everything from the plaster walls to the linen bedsheets was chosen for its durability and tendency to improve with age. Salvaged antique pine floors were bleached and finished with matte polyurethane. The kitchen was outfitted with stone counters treated with a suede finish \u201cto create age and warmth\u201d and a \u201cpatina from the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a nice weathered edge so that instead of being upset about a new chip, you\u2019re actually just enhancing the spirit of the house.\u201dUse neutrals as your foundation, she said, and then build on that with accent colors. When Ms. Rosenthal decorated a home in Southport, Conn., for a client who planned to rent it out, she used modern furniture in white, leather and wood, and accessorized with \u201cbig, happy art,\u201d throw pillows and colorful vases and bowls.More than 20 years ago, Mr. Nahem and his partner, Jeff Fields, bought a modest 1960s ranch-style oceanfront house on Further Lane, in East Hampton, N.Y., and then renovated it and prepped it for summer rental. After studying the competition, Mr. Nahem decided to plow the rental proceeds back into the property.In fact, he plowed the whole house. The overhaul included tearing down the original structure and building a two-story home with expansive ocean views, a gym, a hot tub and a pool. Since then, renters have been willing to pay as much as $10,000 a night for the privilege of staying there (for a minimum of two weeks) \u2014 among them, the King and Queen of Jordan, Mr. Downey and his family, and Giada de Laurentiis, the celebrity chef. A few years ago, Mr. Nahem bought the house next door, which he now rents out for about $6,000 a night.\u201cThe entire property was renovated and improved,\u201d he said. \u201cI knew that having all bedrooms with en suite bathrooms was an important feature, that having soaking tubs, steam showers and two equal master bedrooms with accessible outdoor space was an upgraded feature. Upgraded mattresses and rugs in every room also help for a more homey feel.\u201dTo elevate a rental\u2019s d\u00e9cor if you\u2019re on a budget, Mr. Nahem recommended mixing inexpensive furniture with high-end or vintage pieces.Each bedroom in the house is outfitted with bedside lamps, solar shades with blackout drapes and an ottoman, chair or bench, so guests \u201chave an easy place to throw their bag or suitcase,\u201d Ms. Novogratz said.Beds are dressed with crisp, white linens (as they would be in a hotel) and decorative pillows that brighten the space. \u201cTo add character, I like to pull from my collection of vintage quilts and have one at the foot of each bed,\u201d she said, noting that you could also \u201cadd some fun books on the side table, with fresh flowers for an inviting touch.\u201dGuests should have places to congregate, but they also need private spots where they can find solitude. \u201cOur side porch has beautiful natural light,\u201d said Ms. Novogratz, who furnished it with a vintage daybed. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect place to cozy up and read a book.\u201dMs. Bolognino\u2019s house, which she rents on Airbnb, is part of a 20-acre retreat called Silent G Farms, and it tends to attract New Yorkers in need of rest, she said. To make them feel pampered, she focuses on details that a host might overlook, providing things like soaps, towels and burlap place mats monogrammed with her farm\u2019s \u201cG\u201d logo, all of which she buys on Etsy.At Mr. Gambrel\u2019s Hamptons rental, you\u2019ll find not only leather upholstery and high-end bedding, but also extra-thick, custom-cut sisal carpets. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain level of warmth it provides,\u201d he said of the sisal, noting that while it has to be replaced every few years, it adds character and elevates the overall design.The idea is that if guests have a better experience with the house, \u201chopefully they take better care of it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more you finish a house \u2014 the more you complete the story \u2014 the more respect people have for it.\u201d Don\u2019t rely on your host to furnish all the niceties.\u201cThis year, I was the happiest about the paper lantern that I hung over the table on the screened-in porch,\u201d he said. \u201cI loved sitting outside, but even with candles, it was too dark. I noticed that there was a plug outside, so I ordered the lantern and light kit on Amazon, and had it up and running in less than five minutes.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Neighbor Bro Smashes My Romantic Fantasy", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byModern LoveShe hoped her new apartment would lead to a relationship within its walls, not a parade of hookups outside of them.\u201cAre you sure you can afford it?\u201d she asked as I signed the contract. \u201cMaybe your boyfriend will move in and help?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a boyfriend,\u201d I said.\u201cLili was alone when she moved in,\u201d she said, referring to the previous tenant who had shown me the apartment. \u201cBut then she met Nathan and they lived there for five years.\u201d She leaned in closer. \u201cMaybe you don\u2019t have a boyfriend now, but you will soon.\u201d Then she winked, as if to say: It worked for Lili; it will work for you too.The apartment was big and cheap for Bushwick, with exposed brick and wood floors that were perfectly distressed. It was a good place to live alone \u2014 on a busy street that felt safe at night, and within five subway stops of my closest friends. But it was also big enough for two people, with a bonus room in the middle of the apartment and an extra closet for spare clothing.As someone who could be described as super single, I felt optimistic about a place seemingly so eager to accommodate a couple.The apartment was also a short walk from a loft rented by two friends of mine and a rotation of roommates who occupied the extra bedrooms. Most of the people I got to know my first year in the city I had met at parties at the loft, and every man I dated or thought about dating in Brooklyn had lived there. The loft was like a gallery of romantic prospects for me, and living nearby seemed like a move in the right direction.Even though I could barely afford the rent, I treated my apartment like my forever home. I caulked the drafty windows. I hung wall art. I bought furniture for the space that was once a second bedroom and now would be an underutilized formal dining room.One day I came home to an Amazon Prime delivery in Lili\u2019s name, somehow mistakenly delivered to the address long after she moved. A couple months later, after several unsuccessful attempts to return the package, I finally opened it. Inside were two throw blankets and a teakettle similar to ones I\u2019d been planning to buy for myself. It was like a housewarming gift paid backward.Somehow, though, none of this had the desired effect on my love life. One man was so intimidated to see that I owned not only a microwave but also a table to put it on, that he immediately demanded to know my salary. (Less than his, which he took as a relief). Another tried to give his unwanted furniture to me when he moved out of the loft because I had the space for it. (I took a clothing rack and refused the rest.)On a visit home to Michigan I met up with a friend for dinner to complain about my perpetual singleness.\u201cI don\u2019t understand how you\u2019re supposed to meet anyone,\u201d she said.I described the loft as a factory churning out eligible men for me, when in fact it had produced only a few failed prospects.She was no stranger to romantic disappointment herself but had recently met the love of her life, quickly adopting the beatific optimism of the well paired.\u201cMaybe someone new will move in,\u201d she said. But when I told her the loft was about to be emptied of tenants and renovated, she burst out laughing despite herself.\u201cYou know,\u201d I said, repeating what was becoming a mantra. \u201cThere really isn\u2019t someone for everyone. Lots of people end up alone.\u201dSoon the new owners began their work on the loft, reconfiguring the units into smaller apartments, and everyone I knew who lived there moved out. Then I got fired. I had to ask my parents for help with rent while I collected unemployment and posted my place on Airbnb. I did everything I could to keep the apartment.And then a man did arrive.He moved into the apartment next door, and I hated him at first sound. He talked in what I called Bro Voice (like vocal fry, but for men) and rode a skateboard around the neighborhood whenever he wasn\u2019t banging heavy objects into one of our shared walls. I quickly dubbed him Neighbor Bro.Neighbor Bro smoked indoors, kept his shoes in the hallway and once woke me up by assembling Ikea furniture at 3 a.m. the night before my first day at a new job. I hated him more than any neighbor I\u2019d ever had, including one who stole my bike and one who hung an old medicine cabinet in the hallway filled with handmade clay animals.According to my landlord, Neighbor Bro had learned about the apartment from my upstairs neighbor, which made sense, because she was also fond of late-night construction projects.Soon after he moved in, I thought I could hear Neighbor Bro slipping up to her apartment some evenings for what would turn out to be exceptionally loud late-night hookups, occupying the otherwise dull hours between 2 and 5 a.m. by slamming her bed frame into the wall above my head with a vigor that seemed to threaten the structural integrity of the building.I didn\u2019t want to be the angry spinster banging on the ceiling with a broom while her neighbors had sex upstairs. But I also needed sleep, so I kept a broom in the bedroom and knocked on the ceiling whenever my upstairs neighbor made other offending noises past the quiet hour of 12 a.m. I hoped she could deduce that if I could hear her vacuuming her bedroom at midnight, I could definitely hear Neighbor Bro rattling her bed frame at 3 a.m., but this never seemed to dawn on her.Sometimes when I\u2019d knock on the ceiling, Neighbor Bro would yell \u201cWhat?\u201d \u2014 and I couldn\u2019t tell which apartment his voice was coming from.Apparently their arrangement was a casual one, and soon other women were showing up at his door late at night throughout the week, permitting little peace for me on the other side of the wall. One night he spent a couple of hours with the woman upstairs, then returned to his own apartment for his second hookup of the night, while I slept on my couch to escape the noise coming through every shared wall, floor and ceiling between us.I think anyone would be pushed to the edge by this point, but it seems like a particular torture for the interminably celibate to have another person\u2019s sex life forced on her in surround sound.So I left Neighbor Bro a note full of practical suggestions to remedy the situation \u2014 felt pads, a thick rug \u2014 and in return he left an angry screed taped to my door, signed with his phone number and instructions to \u201ctext him if he\u2019s being loud.\u201d (Um, no.)He complained about my loud vacuuming, even though I don\u2019t own a vacuum, and the sound of what he thought were my own late-night romps. Sometimes, he said, he would call his roommate into the room to bear witness to the noise before \u201cthe show was over.\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand what he was talking about. Either the sound was coming from another apartment in the building, or there were two 20-something men with their ears to my wall listening to me \u2014 put away my laundry?Indignant, I started to draft a rebuttal in my head, but there\u2019s no way to say, \u201cI can guarantee you no one is having sex in this apartment!\u201d and come out sounding like a winner. So I decided to move.A friend was separating from her husband and looking for a roommate. I had always preferred to live by myself, but living in my apartment meant for two had forced me to consider how much nicer it would be to share a home, to have someone else take turns emptying the trash and picking fights with the neighbors.She and I started looking at listings together, and I tried to feel better about giving up my apartment by thinking of all the things I didn\u2019t like about it. We would move to a quieter neighborhood where together we could afford a duplex with a yard I had always wanted, a fantasy involving neither the perfect apartment nor the perfect man.One lesson I learned: You can\u2019t will the right man into your life simply by planning for him.Rebecca Woodward is a freelance writer and social media strategist based in New York City.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Thermometer Tells Your Temperature, Then Tells Firms Where to Advertise", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMost of what we do \u2014 the websites we visit, the places we go, the TV shows we watch, the products we buy \u2014 has become fair game for advertisers. Now, thanks to internet-connected devices in the home like smart thermometers, ads we see may be determined by something even more personal: our health.This flu season, Clorox paid to license information from Kinsa, a tech start-up that sells internet-connected thermometers that are a far cry from the kind once made with mercury and glass. The thermometers sync up with a smartphone app that allows consumers to track their fevers and symptoms, making it especially attractive to parents of young children.The data showed Clorox which ZIP codes around the country had increases in fevers. The company then directed more ads to those areas, assuming that households there may be in the market for products like its disinfecting wipes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends disinfecting surfaces to help prevent the flu or its spread.It is unique, Kinsa says, because it comes straight from someone\u2019s household in real time. People don\u2019t have to visit a doctor, search their symptoms on Google or post to Facebook about their fever for the company to know where a spike might be occurring.\u201cThe challenge with Google search or social media or mining any of those applications is you\u2019re taking a proxy signal \u2014 you\u2019re taking someone talking about illness rather than actual illness,\u201d said Inder Singh, the founder and chief executive of Kinsa. Search queries and social media can also be complicated by news coverage of flu season, he said, while data from the C.D.C. is often delayed and comes from hospitals and clinics rather than homes.Christine Bannan, the consumer protection counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said that even though Kinsa appeared to be using the information in a privacy-compliant manner, its business model highlights the need for federal regulation around how consumer data is handled.\u201cUltimately there should be a more uniform standard and it shouldn\u2019t be up to the whims of each company,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s less of a privacy question and more of an ethical question on what we think is acceptable for targeting people who are ill and what safeguards we want to have around that.\u201dKinsa sells its data to other companies under the name Kinsa Insights. While Mr. Singh declined to share the names of other customers, citing confidentiality agreements, he said other companies had used the data to target advertising. It has also been used by pharmacies and manufacturers that make and distribute medicines and cough and cold products to keep retailers\u2019 shelves full with flu-related products when fevers spike in certain areas, he said.One model of Kinsa\u2019s thermometer plugs straight into phones, while another child-friendly version looks like Elmo from \u201cSesame Street.\u201d The company said that most app users opt to share their location and that Kinsa does not link the information to phone numbers or email addresses.\u201cWe take data from our users, we aggregate it, we do all sorts of machine-learning techniques with it and combine it with other data sets and what we ultimately get is a signal,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cThat\u2019s on a ZIP code basis and county-by-county basis.\u201dHe said the data provided unique insight into flu-related illness in specific areas. \u201cWe can tell you if it\u2019s high or low, whether it\u2019s rising, if it\u2019s bigger than the three- or five- year average, when it\u2019s going to peak and how severe the symptoms are, too,\u201d Mr. Singh said.Clorox used that information to increase digital ad spending to sicker areas and pull back in places that were healthier. Consumer interactions with Clorox\u2019s disinfectant ads increased by 22 percent with the data, according to a Kinsa Insights case study that tracked performance between November 2017 and March of this year. That number was arrived at by measuring the number of times an ad was clicked on, the amount of time a person spent with the ad and other undisclosed metrics, according to Vikram Sarma, senior director of marketing in Clorox\u2019s cleaning division.Being able to target ads in this way is a big shift from even seven years ago, when the onset of cold and cough season meant buying 12 weeks of national TV ads that \u201cwould be irrelevant for the majority of the population,\u201d Mr. Sarma said. The flu ultimately reaches the whole country each year, but it typically breaks out heavily in one region first and then spreads slowly to others.While social media offered new opportunities, there has been \u201ca pretty big lag\u201d between tweets about the flu or flulike symptoms and the aggregation of that data for marketers to use, he said.\u201cWhat this does is help us really target vulnerable populations where we have a clear signal about outbreaks,\u201d Mr. Sarma said.Mr. Singh, who was an executive vice president at the Clinton Health Access Initiative, said that Kinsa worked only with clients that can help with its mission of preventing the spread of illness through early detection. It made sense to work with Clorox, he said, because of the C.D.C. recommendation about disinfecting.While Kinsa has a public health mission, other smart-device companies may not have similar mind-sets, Ms. Bannan said.\u201cI can just think of how cigarette and alcohol companies could use strategies like this, or other industries that could really have more harmful effects on people,\u201d she said.Kinsa can make recommendations to individuals in certain situations, Mr. Singh said, pointing to its partnership with Teladoc, a telemedicine company. There is no financial arrangement between Kinsa and Teladoc but the two companies have an agreement that allows people with both apps to transfer their illness history from Kinsa to a Teladoc doctor, he said.\u201cWe\u2019ve made the call that we don\u2019t want to target the individual unless the individual is going to be helped by the intervention,\u201d Mr. Singh said. \u201cSo for example if you have a newborn who has a fever, you need to see the doctor right away and if it\u2019s 3 a.m., I\u2019m very happy to present you the option to talk to a telemedicine doctor.\u201d\u201cTo me,\u201d he added, \u201cthat is not advertising in the strict sense of advertising.\u201dDonald G.

{"Headline": "Trump Opens New Front in His Battle With China: International Shipping", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump plans to withdraw from a 144-year-old postal treaty that has allowed Chinese companies to ship small packages to the United States at a steeply discounted rate, undercutting American competitors and flooding the market with cheap consumer goods.The withdrawal, announced by the White House on Wednesday, is part of a concerted push by Mr. Trump to counter China\u2019s dominance and punish it for what the administration says is a pattern of unfair trade practices. The White House, in a statement, said \u201csufficient progress has not been made on reforming terms\u201d of the postal treaty and that it would begin the withdrawal process while seeking to \u201cnegotiate bilateral and multilateral agreements that resolve the problems.\u201dThe Universal Postal Union treaty, first drafted in 1874, sets fees that national postal services charge to deliver mail and small parcels to countries around the world. Since 1969, poor and developing countries \u2014 including China \u2014 have been assessed lower rates than wealthier countries in Europe and North America.While the lower rates were intended to foster development in Asia and Africa, Chinese companies now make up about 60 percent of packages shipped into the country, taking advantage of the lower rates to ship clothing, household gadgets and consumer electronics. Many websites now offer free shipping from China, in part because of the cheap postal rates, administration officials say.The decision to withdraw was made at the urging of Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line trade adviser, who sees the move as a way to thwart China and an opportunity to challenge the authority of international groups, like the World Trade Organization, that, in his view, fail to give the United States voting powers commensurate with the country\u2019s economic stature.State Department officials were expected on Wednesday to inform officials at the Universal Postal Union in Bern, Switzerland, a branch of the United Nations that administers the treaty, of their intention to pull out of the system and \"self-declare\u201d new, higher rates on China, a United States official said.According to the union\u2019s rules, members will have a year to renegotiate new terms before the withdrawal becomes permanent. \u201cIf negotiations are successful, the administration is prepared to rescind the notice of withdrawal and remain\u201d in the treaty, the White House statement said.The move will most likely inflame tensions with China, which the administration has accused of unfair trade practices and punished with tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, investment restrictions and other measures. Administration officials are still weighing whether Mr. Trump will meet with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, in Argentina next month.It is not clear whether China will retaliate if the United States pulls out of the treaty. Administration officials said they were assessing rates for other countries and had not made any decisions about whether the policy would extend beyond China.Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval to withdraw because the last version of the treaty was never put up to a vote, administration officials said.The pact has been long been a source of frustration for presidents of both parties, and prompted complaints from small businesses, big retailers like Amazon and shipping giants like UPS. The treaty was last modified in 2016 to raise some shipping costs on Chinese exports. But Mr. Navarro and Mr. Trump dismissed those changes as insufficient to deal with the explosion of online free shipping offers of goods from China.The \u201csystem creates winners and losers,\u201d the report\u2019s author\u2019s concluded, especially China\u2019s national postal service and \"Chinese online retailers in the lightweight, low-value package segment at the expense of the U.S. Postal Service and American retailers.\u201dThe losses to retailers and manufacturers could be much more, as online commerce expands further.Industry groups, even ones that have questioned the president\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports, applauded the move as proportional and targeted.\u201cThis outdated arrangement contributes significantly to the flood of counterfeit goods and dangerous drugs that enter the country from China,\u201d said Jay Timmons, chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group. \u201cManufacturers and manufacturing workers in the United States will greatly benefit from a modernized and far more fair arrangement with China.\u201dBut the changes could have an even bigger impact on small retailers who have found themselves outgunned and undercut by Chinese competitors.Jayme Smaldone, who runs a 12-employee housewares company in Rahway, N.J., first became aware of the problem when he noticed websites selling Chinese knockoffs of his Mighty Mug, a desktop coffee cup he designed with an anti-topple base.\u201cSomething has to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can my government be subsidizing China and driving me out of business?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With 8 Years of Job Gains, Unemployment Is Lowest Since 1969", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe unemployment rate fell to a nearly five-decade low in September, punctuating a remarkable rebound in the 10 years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off a global financial crisis.The latest milestone came in a Friday report from the Labor Department: The unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent last month, the lowest since December 1969, when hundreds of thousands of working-age Americans were serving in Vietnam.\u201cI view this as the strongest labor market in a generation,\u201d said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at the career site Glassdoor. \u201cThese really are the good times.\u201dThe turnaround from a decade ago is hard to overstate. In September 2008, American employers cut 443,000 jobs as the financial system collapsed around them. More than seven million more jobs evaporated in the months that followed. Even when the hemorrhaging stopped, shellshocked executives were slow to bring back laid-off workers, sparking fears of a \u201cjobless recovery.\u201dBut when the hiring engine finally kicked back into gear, it did so in historic fashion. The 134,000 jobs added in September made it the 96th consecutive month of growth \u2014 eight full years, double the previous record. Employers have added close to 20 million jobs during that streak. (September\u2019s growth, a modest slowdown from August, would probably have been stronger absent the effects of Hurricane Florence, which struck the Carolinas in the middle of the month.)Republicans are hoping the strong economy will help them hold off a potential \u201cblue wave\u201d of Democratic victories in next month\u2019s midterm elections. Friday\u2019s report was one of the last before Election Day, and President Trump wasted no time before cheering the news on Twitter.Indeed, the decade-long economic rebound from the financial crisis has been impressive more for its durability than for its strength. Millions of Americans remain stuck in part-time or temporary work, and many of the middle-class jobs wiped out by the recession have never returned. As a share of the population, employment remains well below its 2000 peak, a gap only partly explained by the aging population.Most significant, strong hiring has not yet translated into robust raises for many workers. Average hourly earnings rose 2.8 percent in September from a year earlier, down from 2.9 percent in August and well below the growth that economists would usually expect with the unemployment rate this low.But there are signs that wage growth could at long last be gaining momentum. Before last month\u2019s hiccup, the pace of growth had been drifting upward. Industries where labor is especially tight, such as construction and technology, are seeing wages rise faster.Amy Glaser, a senior vice president at the staffing firm Adecco, heard the Amazon news on television while preparing for a meeting with a rival e-commerce firm. Ms. Glaser helps companies hire for the holiday season, a task that Amazon had just made even more difficult for them.\u201cThere was definitely a feeling of concern,\u201d she said. \u201cIt puts increased pressure on them in a market where they already knew they were going to have to make significant adjustments on wages.\u201dHigher pay alone may not be enough. The combination of a tight labor market and rapidly growing online sales has made the competition for warehouse workers particularly fierce this year. Ms. Glaser said companies were hiring earlier, easing job requirements and giving workers more control over their schedules, a big shift in an industry that has traditionally expected workers to show up when and where they are needed.\u201cThe demand for workers is higher than ever, and the supply just isn\u2019t out there right now,\u201d Ms. Glaser said.Christine Specht is dealing with just that challenge. Ms. Specht runs Cousins Subs, a Wisconsin sandwich chain that is struggling to find workers as it looks to expand into the Chicago area.Cousins has raised wages in recent years but still pays well under the $15 an hour that Amazon and other big companies are promising. As the operator of a small chain in a competitive industry, Ms. Specht said, she is reluctant to raise prices in order to pay employees more.\u201cWe can\u2019t always run to the menu board every time there\u2019s a cost increase in running our business,\u201d Ms. Specht said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a last resort.\u201dInstead, the company is looking for other ways to attract workers. Cousins has ramped up its training program to help workers advance into management, offered referral bonuses to employees who help recruit their friends and staged \u201chiring blitz days,\u201d when executives set up shop in a restaurant and interview candidates on the spot. More than anything, they are trying to move quickly.\u201cYou can\u2019t sit on applications anymore, because people have options and they will go somewhere else,\u201d Ms. Specht said.Many economists think the shortage of workers will cause job growth to slow in the months ahead. But others argue that there is still room for the labor pool to expand, as employers become willing to consider candidates they would have overlooked earlier and as higher wages attract people who had been choosing not to work.\u201cYou did see something like that in the late \u201990s, which is probably the closest analogue,\u201d said Jeremy Schwartz, an economist for Credit Suisse in New York. \u201cIn a sufficiently strong labor market, you really were pulling people from the sidelines.\u201dIt is unclear whether that can happen again. In the 1990s, baby boomers were in their prime working years; today, they are retiring at a rate of 10,000 a day. The number of people being hired from outside the labor force is near an all-time high. Yet the participation rate \u2014 the share of adults working or actively looking for work \u2014 has been essentially flat in recent years.\u201cYou do see prime-working-age individuals coming back into the labor force,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cBut the demographic forces are so fierce that it provides a complete offset.\u201dPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve are watching warily for signs that the shrinking pool of labor is leading the economy to overheat, as competition for workers drives up wages and, ultimately, inflation. That could force the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly than planned, which could cause a recession.Yields on United States government bonds have risen sharply in recent days, a sign that investors expect inflation \u2014 and interest rates \u2014 to rise in coming years. Those concerns have also filtered through to the stock market, where major indexes fell again on Friday after dropping on Thursday.With the economy in such strong shape, attention on Wall Street has turned to what could bring the good times to an end. Fed rate increases are one popular answer. A trade war is another.Economists and business leaders have warned for months that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs could threaten the recovery, particularly in manufacturing. There is little sign of that so far, however. That sector added 18,000 jobs in September, and the revised figures erased what was initially reported as a small decline in August. Other measures of the industrial sector likewise show continued growth.\u201cWe really don\u2019t have any negative impact from the tariffs yet,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist for the consulting firm RSM.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Gender War, 2018 Edition", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWe are at a tipping point in an age-old story.Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.On Oct. 11, when Victoria Bissell Brown\u2019s husband Jim made a dismissive remark, \u201cI just blew and ranted,\u201d she told me in a phone interview. \u201cHe suddenly became all men.\u201dBrown, who at 69 is a retired history professor, described her husband of 49 years in the essay as \u201ca man who will listen to a woman,\u201d \u201cone of the good men\u201d who \u201crespect women,\u201d \u201cbelieve in women,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t hit women or rape women or in any way abuse women.\u201dOn that night, however, her husband\u2019s \u201csmall, thoughtless, dismissive, annoyed, patronizing comment\u201d became a \u201cmicrowave that triggered a hurricane\u201d:As my rage rushed through the streets of my mind, toppling every memory of every good thing my husband has ever done (and there are scores of memories), I said the meanest thing I\u2019ve ever said to him: \u201cDon\u2019t you dare sit there and sympathetically promise to change. Don\u2019t say you will stop yourself before you blurt out some impatient, annoyed, controlling remark. No, I said, you can\u2019t change. You are unable to change.\u201dThe Trump administration generally and the Brett Kavanaugh hearing specifically have produced a \u201ctorrent of memories,\u201d Brown wrote, memories ofbeing dismissed, disdained, distrusted. Memories of having to endure put-downs at the office, catcalls in the parking lot, barked orders at a dinner party. And, for some reason, the most chilling memory of all, the one Christine Blasey Ford called up and that we all recognized: the laughter. The laughter of men who are bonding with each other by mocking us.We cannot afford to dismiss or fetishize or marginalize or rear back from women\u2019s anger any longer if we want this moment to be transformative. We have to look at it straight, stop hemming and hawing around it or trying to disavow it or worrying that it might offend and discomfit. It must be and always has been at the heart of social progress.She goes on:What I have glimpsed, in the moments when I have let myself give voice to the deep, rich, curdled fury that for years I tried to pretty up and make easier on everyone\u2019s stomach, is that for all the care we take to bottle it up, rage can be a powerful tonic.The anger expressed by Traister and Brown is indicative of a central phenomenon of the 2018 election: a record-setting gender gap.The question is crucial because behavior based on societal expectations is far more amenable to change through government intervention, the approach generally preferred by liberals, than behavior based on biology.Pew found, for example, that majorities of Republicans, ranging from 56 to 67 percent, said that biological differences between men and women were the prime reason for their differing \u201capproach to parenting,\u201d to \u201chow they express their feelings\u201d and their choice \u201cof hobbies and personal interests.\u201d Decisive majorities of Democrats, ranging from 65 to 68 percent, took the opposite view, that these differences were the result of societal expectations.Similarly, 56 percent of Republicans agreed that \u201cthere is too little emphasis on encouraging boys to be leaders,\u201d a view shared by a substantially smaller 30 percent of Democrats.Conversely, 64 percent of Democrats said there was too little emphasis on encouraging girls to be leaders. Far fewer Republicans, 39 percent, agreed. Asked if it was a good or bad thing that \u201csociety looks up to masculine men,\u201d Republicans said it was good by 78-20, while Democrats were split, 49-48.Asked whether they agreed that \u201cmen getting away with sexual harassment or assault\u201d was a \u201cmajor problem,\u201d 62 percent of Democrats said yes, compared with 33 percent of Republicans. Asked whether a failure to believe women who say they were harassed was a major problem, 60 percent of Democrats said yes, while 28 percent of Republicans agreed.When women did not work, they would often assume the political preferences of their husbands. When women didn\u2019t have access to income they held more socially conservative views in part because they wanted to protect the sanctity of their marriages and shore up against the possibility of divorce lest they be left without a breadwinner.That changed when women began to have their own sources of income:When women began to work, we see the beginning of the divergence of political preferences. Because women often work in jobs that are lower paying then men, they often have stronger preferences for government social services and typically tolerate higher levels of taxes that help pay for such services.When \u201cthe pill\u201d was released in the U.S. in 1960 it revolutionized women\u2019s reproductive health. For the first time in human history, women could have sex and have complete control over their own reproductive function. By the late 60s and 70s women\u2019s enrollment in four-year colleges and the work force surged and they gained economic independence.The issue of women\u2019s control over their own bodies, Jacobs argued,has shaped the social and political landscape ever since. I think the rise of Trump reflects a deep-seated insecurity over men\u2019s social role. They are no longer sole breadwinner and, as Piers Morgan would have you believe, child care is the ultimate demasculinizing act.The course of tension and conflict between the sexes after the 1960s is complex, but can be summarized as a conflict over traditional ideas about gender that preserve the privilege of white, heterosexual males and ideas that want to change gender roles and ideology.there is a persistent political gender gap in the trade-off between guns and butter: men are likelier than women to favor the more hawkish and law-and-order candidate, women the candidate who promises more social spending. The asymmetry is hardly surprising to an evolutionary biologist.This difference, Pinker wrote in an email, emerges from that fact that males of many mammalian species compete for dominance (which in traditional societies translated into more mating opportunities, hence more offspring), including the dominance of their group relative to other group. They are often willing to take lethal risks to get a shot at the jackpot of being an alpha male or part of an alpha group, especially since their offspring can survive without them, albeit at greater risk.\u201cFor females,\u201d Pinker continued,such a risk is insane: they won\u2019t bear any more offspring if they are more dominant (since unlike males, their reproductive output is fixed by the time it takes to gestate and nurse a baby), and their offspring can\u2019t survive without them.In terms of politics, Pinker argues,the asymmetry is there, and it could affect gut-level sympathies: men toward politicians that embrace violence (the police and army) to enhance the competitive formidability of their perceived group against other \u201ctribes,\u201d be they foreign countries or rival races or ethnicities within their own country; women toward politicians that promise benefits to the health and education of children.First, Buss argues, there is the mismatch between ancestral and modern work environments. Humans evolved as hunter-gatherers who engaged in periodic intergroup warfare.\u201d Buss notes, \u201cWarfare was almost exclusively a male activity. There is not a single instance in all of human recorded history of women forming a war party to attack another group and capture mates or territory from another group.While \u201chighly sex-segregated work environments,\u201d Buss writes, were the rule \u201cover 99 percent of human evolutionary history,\u201d in the modern work environment \u201cwomen and men are not only expected to work together, but, dramatically, they are now competing for the same jobs.\u201dThe tensions resulting from \u201cthe increasing integration of women working with men and competing with men and each other for key positions in the workplace\u201d are exacerbated by what Buss calls \u201cinappropriate mating adaptations.\u201dBuss wrote:When men and women interact, mating adaptations get activated, because people tend to be attracted to those with similar interests, and workplaces put people with similar interests into close proximity, and mating psychology gets even more activated.\u201cAdd to this volatile mix,\u201d Buss continues,the evidence that men who attain positions of status feel \u201centitled\u201d to greater sexual access to women \u2014 in fact that access was one of the key driving forces that led men over evolutionary history to have such strong status-seeking and resource-acquisition motivations.that women\u2019s preference for men with resources and men\u2019s competitive strategies have coevolved \u2014 the outcome being a tendency for men worldwide to control more resources, power and position than women. There is strong evidence from a study of 37 cultures involving 10,047 participants that women have a greater desire for long-term mates who not only possess economic resources, but also possess characteristics that are likely to lead to resources over time, such as ambition, industriousness, and social status. These preferences, operating repeatedly over human evolutionary history, have led women to favor as mates men who possess status and resources and to exclude from mating men lacking status and resources.One source of conflict, she says, is the threat to powerful men \u2014 who are not accustomed to being challenged and who sometimes feel wrongly accused \u2014 from the outpouring of revelations about sexual harassment and sexual assault.\u201d Another source of contention, she argues, \u201cis the feelings of resentment by working- and middle-class men who have lost relative social status in the wake of a variety of social and economic changes, including the growth in workplace opportunities for women.Schlozman cautioned against exaggeration of the extent to which enhanced gender conflict implies a partisan war between women and men. At a time when American politics is characterized by deepening divisions along many fault lines, there are men and women on both sides of the chasm.Gender roles, according to Hrdy,have long been packed with tension. Nothing new. Carried to an extreme these tensions can result in oppressive restrictions, not just on women\u2019s autonomy and opportunities but really damaging subsistence-threatening losses in freedom of movement and reproductive choices.Hrdy wrote that there is \u201cno doubt\u201d that evolution is a factor, \u201chaving to do with primate male predispositions to control female reproduction,\u201d but noted that she was hesitant to go into thembecause the sources of these predispositions are really complicated \u2014 long-running evolution of female reproductive strategies and male counter-strategies, generating female counter-strategies.Hrdy voiced her worries about contemporary developments in a 2018 letter she wrote her classmates in preparation for the 50th anniversary of her graduation from Radcliffe College:Hrdy said she had been asked \u201cWhat questions or issues do you think are going to be most important for women in the future?\u201dHer answer:Control over their own reproduction. It is conceivable to me that birth control, and particularly abortion, may become defined as \u201cimmoral\u201d or \u201cunacceptable\u201d behavior and ruled out as options. Virtually all advances by women are linked to women having a choice over whether or not to bear and rear young.When women see that control \u2014 and their autonomy more broadly \u2014 threatened, anger becomes a rational response.Victoria Brown, quoted at the beginning of this column, described the moment when her husband, in her view, threatened her autonomy and \u201cbecame all men.\u201dDavid Buss, at the same time, strikes a cautionary note about lumping \u201call men\u201d or \u201call women\u201d together. \u201cWhen one speaks of \u2018conflict between the sexes\u2019 or \u2018a political difference between the sexes,\u2019 \u201d Buss said,one is using aggregate statistics to summarize a collection of individual phenomena. From an evolutionary perspective, each individual women is aligned in her interests with some other women (her friends, mother, daughter, niece, etc.), but also not aligned in her interests with other specific women (her mating rivals; her competitors for jobs; etc.). The same goes for men.Similarly, each individual woman is aligned in her interests with some men (e.g., her husband, her son, her father, her male friends) and also not aligned with other specific men (e.g., those who sexually harass her; a male competitor in her workplace vying for the same position; etc.).So one has to be careful when speaking about \u201cwomen as a group\u201d and \u201cmen as a group,\u201d since this erroneously implies that there is unity of interests among men in opposition to women and vice versa, which does not exist.Buss\u2019s point is well taken, but that does not diminish the reality that the divergence in male and female voting behavior has reached record levels and that this divergence may well determine the outcome of the 2018 elections.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A Momentous Election in Brazil: What\u2019s at Stake?", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Bolsonaro, 63, a former army captain, was first elected to Congress in 1991. During most of his legislative career, he was a marginal figure known for speaking nostalgically about the 1964-1985 military dictatorship and for making incendiary comments about women and minorities.But as the country\u2019s main political parties were swept up in a large-scale corruption investigation, known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash, Mr. Bolsonaro has pitched himself to voters as an anti-establishment maverick who will fight graft. And in a country traumatized by violent crime, his iron-fisted approach to law and order has appealed to voters in traditionally left-wing strongholds.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s meteoric rise is all the more remarkable because he campaigned on a shoestring budget, relying largely on social media, while his rivals enjoyed generous public funding and coveted slots on television and radio, which are awarded based on party size.Weeks before the first round of voting, Mr. Bolsonaro was stabbed at a rally and was forced to campaign from his bed. Wall-to-wall coverage of the attack, though, kept him in the headlines and seemed to have increased his appeal.Mr. Bolsonaro also benefited from last-minute endorsements from evangelicals and the powerful agribusiness industry.Mr. Haddad\u2019s campaign, which began only a month before the first round of voting, faced its own challenges. He was chosen to replace Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on the ballot after the former president, who is serving a prison term on corruption and money-laundering charges, was barred from running as the Workers\u2019 Party candidate.Mr. da Silva had been leading in the polls until the courts ruled in August that he was ineligible to run.Despite the campaign slogan \u201cHaddad Is Lula,\u201d the less charismatic Mr. Haddad has failed to fully win over the former president\u2019s base. He also faced the wrath of voters who blamed the Workers\u2019 Party not only for the corruption scandal but also for a crippling recession that began on the watch of Mr. da Silva\u2019s successor, former President Dilma Rousseff.Soaring crime, a struggling economy and corruption have dominated the debate.Although Mr. Bolsonaro could not point to any major accomplishments during his seven terms as a lawmaker, he highlighted his clean record. He cultivated an image as a crude but honest candidate and vowed to reject traditional horse-trading.Brazilians\u2019 disgust with politics as usual became apparent in the first round of voting, when conservatives allied with Mr. Bolsonaro won a surprising number of congressional seats \u2014 52 up from eight \u2014 making his Social Liberal Party the second-largest in the lower house.While Mr. Haddad tried to distance himself from Mr. da Silva after the first round of voting \u2014 removing the former president\u2019s image from campaign ads and swapping the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s traditional red for the blue, green and yellow of the Brazilian flag \u2014 he dodged questions about the party\u2019s responsibility for the corruption scandal.Those positions are popular among many Brazilians because of the epidemic of violence plaguing much of the country, where a record 62,517 people were killed last year.Opponents of Mr. Bolsonaro have drawn attention to his long history of racist, homophobic and misogynistic remarks. The attorney general earlier this year charged him with inciting hatred against minorities, citing a speech during which Mr. Bolsonaro described visiting a traditional community of black Brazilians, whom he called fat and so lazy that they were \u201cnot even capable of procreating.\u201dMany of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters regard his controversial positions and remarks \u2014 he has called women ignorant, told a female lawmaker she was too ugly to rape and questioned why women should earn the same salary as men \u2014 as straight talk from a decisive and authentic politician.On the economy, Mr. Haddad appealed to poor voters with promises to extend social spending and \u201cmake Brazil happy again.\u201d But Mr. Bolsonaro has sought to win over the middle and upper classes, as well as the markets, by choosing Paulo Guedes, a pro-business, University of Chicago-trained investor to be his future finance minister.A victory by Mr. Bolsonaro could signal the crumbling of much of the political establishment, which has been dominated by the Workers\u2019 Party since 2002.\u201cThose red good-for-nothings will be banished from the homeland,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a cleanup the likes of which has never been seen in Brazilian history.\u201dSome Brazilians have been concerned that Mr. Haddad\u2019s election could undermine the Car Wash investigation and lead to Mr. da Silva\u2019s release from jail. That gave them a reason to back Mr. Bolsonaro.Perhaps the biggest challenge facing the next president is the economy. Brazil is struggling to emerge from its worst recession on record, which left nearly 13 million people unemployed.Mr. Bolsonaro has promised to champion the agribusiness sector, which seeks to open up more forests to produce beef and soybeans. He has threatened to weaken or eliminate the Environment Ministry and withdraw funding from agencies that punish illegal loggers and miners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dyson Wants to Curl Your Hair", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut its cutting-edge technology \u2014 magical air currents \u2014 will cost you.\u201cThis will break the internet,\u201d said Jen Atkin, the founder of Ouai Haircare and stylist to several Kardashians. Her excitement was not for a celebrity makeover or magazine cover but for the latest product introduction from Dyson: the Airwrap, a tool that can curl or smooth or dry hair. \u201cMy reaction was, like, this is so incredible,\u201d she said.The Airwrap release follows the introduction in spring 2016 of the Supersonic, the doughnut-shaped hair dryer with a $399.99 price tag that was Dyson\u2019s first foray into the beauty market. A Google search for Dyson Supersonic and \u201cworth the hype\u201d yields more than 9,000 results. So one may expect the Airwrap to be met with a similar blend of curiosity and excitement. But unlike the Supersonic, whose features are familiar to anyone who has used a standard blow dryer, the Airwrap requires a certain measure of coaching.On a recent morning in a SoHo hotel suite, representatives from Dyson joined Jon Reyman, a hairstylist and an owner of the Spoke & Weal salons, to demonstrate.The product is shaped like a traditional curling iron but with a detachable head. There are 30- and 40-millimeter barrels for curling as well as a hair dryer attachment, a round brush and two kinds of smoothing brushes. They are sold in various combinations: Volume & Shape (for straighter and thinner hair with the dryer, soft brush, round brush and 30-millimeter barrel); Smooth & Control (for curlier and thicker hair, with the dryer, firm brush and both 30- and 40-millimeter barrels).Each is $499.99, or there is a kit with all of the attachments for $549.99. All three come in a camel-color leather storage case that looks almost like something Herm\u00e8s might produce.Using the dryer attachment, Mr. Reyman worked on a model\u2019s long blond hair until it was almost but not entirely dry. Then he removed the attachment and put on the 30-millimeter barrel. He held the hair about four inches from the end and turned on the device, showing off the Airwrap\u2019s neat trick: The hair wrapped itself around the barrel. He pushed a button for cool air to set the curl and released it.The result was a bouncier, more voluminous curl than one has come to expect from a standard curling wand \u2014 and lacked the singed smell often associated with irons. \u201cCurling irons damage your hair and compress the hair shaft,\u201d Mr. Reyman said. \u201cWith this, you get the same pattern without the damage, but the result is also fuller.\u201dWhile the a large majority of curling irons or hot brushes sold on Amazon are under $50, Dyson promises benefits in exchange for the high cost. The Airwrap can be used on wet hair and, with heat at less than 300 degrees, is much less hot than the 360 to 450 degrees that other curling wands average, which is good for protecting hair from damage but also skin from injury. A 2001 study in the journal Academic Emergency Medicine found that over five years studied, there were an estimated 105,081 injuries related to hair-care products, of which thermal burns were the most common.The Supersonic was touted as being lighter and faster at drying and less damaging than other models on the market. And, it had the cachet of being innovative and it looked different from anything that had come before. Even though the company, based in Malmesbury in Wiltshire, England, declined to share sales figures, it appears to have been a hit. \u201cIt was kind of a historic launch,\u201d said Priya Venkatesh, the senior vice president of merchandising for skin and hair at the Sephora beauty chain. \u201cIt was a case where it totally delivered and surpassed expectations. Dyson is priced higher in every category they enter, and I don\u2019t recall there being a big protest on the price itself.\u201d In fact, she said, it was one of Sephora\u2019s top-selling brands online and the first time a hair product hit the top five holiday sellers, which it did for the last two years.It also became a status symbol \u2014 Dyson recently released a version of the Supersonic plated in 23.75-karat gold that sells for $499.99 \u2014 and a cult object. \u201cWe never go into a category looking to do a single product,\u201d said Tom Crawford, Dyson\u2019s global research and development director for personal care. The development process of the Airwrap has taken about six years, 642 prototype iterations and $31.4 million in development costs.\u201cWhen we\u2019re going to a new product, we start from scratch, and we try to understand the fundamentals first,\u201d Mr. Crawford said. \u201cInstead of having a funky idea and seeing if it works, we go back to basics and specify what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d In this case the mission was to engineer a styling tool that eliminated the problem of high heat and damaged hair.At the early stages Dyson had two teams working in parallel. One was a research team looking at technology, motors, air flow, acoustics, noise or the science of hair. Another team looked at the science of human interaction with the product. As Mr. Crawford explained, \u201cThey\u2019re saying: \u2018Having to wrap your hair around a hot iron and rotate it is awkward. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if you didn\u2019t have to do that. Let\u2019s try to get rid of that process.\u2019 It\u2019s scientific research working in tandem with blue-sky thinkers coming up with wild ideas. Then we force-fit these two approaches to one.\u201dThen there\u2019s testing, in both the virtual and physical world: dropping it from overhead, knocking it on walls, smashing it on the ground. Engineers were encouraged to try it out and test prototypes to see if they broke. A fringe benefit, one imagines, is to let out a little steam.Some of Dyson\u2019s 12,000 employees tested it, as did about 20 hairstylists, like Mr. Reyman and Ms. Atkin, who said she was often observed by engineers recording her using it. \u201cI was this loudmouth hairstylist giving my frank critique to months and months of work,\u201d she said with a laugh.Mr. Crawford emphasized the importance of feedback. \u201cWe learn the frustrations and problems that different people will be responding to,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Japanese culture, people bathe and shower before bed. And in sunny states in the U.S., they\u2019re concerned about UV damage to the hair.\u201dWhat about future personal care ventures, like a flat iron? \u201cWe\u2019re always looking to solve problems,\u201d Mr. Crawford said. \u201cAre we developing things? Maybe.\u201dFor the Airwrap introduction, expectations are high but managed. \u201cIn general blow dyers are a bigger market,\u201d Ms. Venkatesh of Sephora said. \u201cThe consumer will have a little more learning to do with this one, but it\u2019s a very compelling proposition. I\u2019m not yet expecting it to beat the Supersonic, but we\u2019re willing to be surprised.\u201dMr. Reyman doesn\u2019t think it has a lot of competition. \u201cNothing on the market is exceptional,\u201d he said.

{"Headline": "They Live in Public", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "Jill Soloway is building a gender-free empire.Supported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 There were show tunes rolling through the bright, loft-like spaces of Topple, Jill Soloway\u2019s production company on the Paramount lot, just across the street from the Gene Roddenberry building. A sign on the bathroom proclaimed, \u201cEvery Body,\u201d three times. A glass cabinet was an armory for Mx. Soloway\u2019s trophies, Emmys and Golden Globes for \u201cTransparent,\u201d their groundbreaking Amazon series about a family of three preening, questing and hapless adult siblings whose father has come out as a transgender woman, a plot sparked by the coming-out of their own parent, now known as Carrie (her daughters, Jill and Faith, call her Moppa). There were awards from GLAAD, the LGBT advocacy and media monitoring organization, and from the NAACP.The song was pure Soloway: the skewering, and celebration, of a certain expression of upper middle-class Jewish life. \u201cSo good,\u201d Mx. Soloway said, beaming. \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s amazing. I\u2019m feeling it! You guys did that so fast! Guys, it\u2019s all happening.\u201d It was more than a career blow for Mx. Soloway and the \u201cTransparent\u201d team. It was the upending of a utopian ideal.Topple is run on a set of core principles printed on a hand-sized cardboard placard with rainbow stripes on its back. \u201cOur Revolution Must Be Intersectional,\u201d is number one, and the second one exhorts, \u201cBe Chill,\u201d though as Mx. Soloway said, \u201cWe\u2019re thinking of changing that to, \u2018Be Kind,\u2019 because really, in the wake of all this, I\u2019m supposed to be chill?\u201dAfter the author falls in love with a lesbian while still married, the two enthusiastically make a short comedy about female ejaculation. The Topple crew pitched in, building a giant vagina and helping with costumes. Mx. Soloway calls the film, inevitably, \u201cIf You Build It, She Will Come.\u201dMx. Soloway describes dogged efforts to make it in Hollywood, and jealousy at the soaring careers of compatriots like Lena Dunham and Diablo Cody. It was, in part, their wry essay imagining the ignominies of being Courteney Cox\u2019s assistant, which include making an appointment to bleach a certain area of the actor\u2019s anatomy, that kick-started Mx. Soloway\u2019s career as a television writer (on HBO\u2019s \u201cSix Feet Under,\u201d among other series). But it took their parent\u2019s phone call in 2011 to really change that trajectory. \u201cJilly, are you sitting down?\u201d said Carrie. Gender was complicated for Mx. Soloway, for whom puberty arrived late, but with the sudden appearance of large breasts. \u201cDo other people\u2019s memories of their teenage years include things like soccer competitions or blue ribbons?\u201d they write. \u201cAll I have is the memory of being suddenly overwhelmed by becoming sex to others.\u201dBut Mx. Soloway was a game girl, a get-along girl, \u201cand it was only recently that I realized, Wow, that was the first thing that really entered the room, the first thing people saw about me and that there was a cost.\u201dIt is partly this experience that gave them their book title. \u201c\u2018She wants it,\u2019 is what men say about women who \u2018deserve\u2019 what they get,\u201d Mx. Soloway said. \u201cSo for me to go from, \u2018She wants it\u2019-object that\u2019s being pointed at in high school \u2014 look, \u2018She wants it, she\u2019s turning me on\u2019 \u2014 to \u2018She wants it,\u2019-subject, \u2018She wants this scene, this actor, this moment,\u2019 is what the book covers. That\u2019s why I really wanted to keep the title instead of changing it to, \u2018She Wanted It,\u2019 or \u2018They Want It,\u2019 or \u2018We Want It.\u2019 I think in some ways it\u2019s a Dear John letter to femininity. I wasn\u2019t thinking that, as I was directing my first movie, as I was getting breast reduction surgery, but it turns out that as I was finding my voice, I was peeling off, first the physical layers of femininity \u2014 the breasts, the clothes, the hair and the makeup. I feel like I\u2019ve come to the other side, where I\u2019m like nothing. Just human. I feel like I\u2019ve come through the woods.\u201dEven before Mx. Soloway had written the script for the pilot of \u201cTransparent,\u201d when Carrie had just come out, they and Faith, in typical Soloway fashion, decided to make a musical about it all.\u201cThis idea of music rescuing our family was all there,\u201d Mx. Soloway said. \u201cSo we\u2019re like, Let\u2019s just keep blowing on the flame. The Pfeffermans will live on, and that\u2019s what kept us going and then Jen Salke\u201d \u2014 Jennifer Salke is now the head of studios at Amazon \u2014 \u201csat down with me and told me, \u2018It\u2019s going to be OK.\u2019 So we just kept singing.\u201d\u201cTransparent,\u201d the musical, a two-hour movie to be shot later this year, will air on Amazon next fall.\u201cIt will hopefully feel like \u2018Jesus Christ Superstar\u2019 mixed with \u2018La La Land\u2019 mixed with \u2018Flight of the Conchords\u2019 with something more Jewish thrown in,\u201d Mx. Soloway said. \u201cA little \u2018Yentl.\u2019\u201d\u201cWho would I be if I was raised non-gender?\u201d said Mx. Soloway. \u201cWho would I be if no one had said, \u2018Pretty girl\u2019?\u201dMs. Boylan has had her eye on \u201cTransparent\u201d from the beginning. After Mx. Soloway finished the pilot, they asked Ms. Boylan to be a consultant on the production, because at the time it still had no transgender writers. Ms. Boylan promptly declined. As she said, \u201cEvery week I get an email from someone claiming they\u2019re making a new show about a transgender character and this one is going to be really good and they\u2019re always terrible, sometimes in direct proportion to the good intentions of the person making it.\u201dBut she agreed to watch the pilot, which moved her so much that she also agreed to talk to the crew about her own experiences. She spent a day with Mr. Tambor, who clocked many of her mannerisms and incorporated them into his portrayal of Maura, she said. \u201cThat thing when she twirls her hair through her fingers,\u201d said Ms. Boylan, who was fascinated by the actor\u2019s process. \u201cThat was me. He did a Vulcan mind meld on me.\u201d And she did a press junket when the series launched. At the time, Ms. Boylan was co-chair of GLAAD, and Mx. Soloway and their colleagues were working with the organization to make sure that \u201cTransparent\u201d did its best to portray its queer and trans characters appropriately.Was casting Mr. Tambor, as Mx. Soloway wrote in their book, the original sin that doomed the enterprise?\u201cIn the end all I can say is that Jill tried to do something tremendous and new. They tried to create this alternative universe in Hollywood which for a long time worked,\u201d Ms. Boylan said. \u201cOne TV show isn\u2019t going to end the oppression of the patriarchy, but it\u2019s still awfully good work to be doing.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to two women who accused Jeffrey Tambor of sexual harassment. They were a former \u201cTransparent\" crew member and a member of the cast, not former Topple employees.Advertisement"}

While the company said its revenue rose 43 percent to a record $298 million in the third quarter from a year earlier, its net loss totaled $325 million. The loss was narrower than a year ago.The company\u2019s stock, which has lost almost half its value since the beginning of the year, fell 11 percent in after-hours trading after closing at $6.99 at the end of regular trading.The company said people continued to drift away from Snapchat\u2019s Android app in particular because it did not offer the same speed and performance as the iPhone app. Snap has been working to change its Android app for some time, but did not announce a date for the redesign.Evan Spiegel, Snap\u2019s chief executive, said the company was focused on quality rather than speed as it prepares the Android project, code-named Mushroom.\u201cWe are making good progress testing the application in select markets,\u201d Mr. Spiegel said. \u201cWe look forward to rolling it out when it\u2019s ready.\u201dThe company expects to continue losing daily active users in the current quarter, said Tim Stone, Snap\u2019s chief financial officer.

{"Headline": "Amazon HQ2 Watch: Northern Virginia Checks the Most Boxes", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySEATTLE \u2014 Amazon won\u2019t say a word about where it plans to put its much-hyped second headquarters. Officials in the 20 cities and regions named as finalists say that they don\u2019t know anything \u2014 and that even if they did, they wouldn\u2019t share it publicly.But that hasn\u2019t stopped investors, economic officials and developers from trying to reverse engineer the HQ2 search, to understand what a company seen as embodying the future wants and needs, and what local governments should do to be part of that future.Many have gone a step further, suggesting that Crystal City, an older office area being revitalized just across the Potomac River from Washington, offers the best site. Its upsides: good transit, diverse residents, a friendly business climate and a single developer with a big chunk of land.\u201cThere are a lot of merits to a lot of these places, but at the end of the day, all of the signs are pointing to Crystal City,\u201d said Amy Liu, director of the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. \u201cI\u2019m just going to say it.\u201dAmazon says it will announce its decision by the end of the year. Other areas that are regularly named as strong contenders include Chicago, Atlanta and Austin, Tex. Washington and the Maryland suburbs are also finalists.The interest in the area rose a few weeks ago when Mr. Bezos headlined an event at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. More than 1,000 executives, ambassadors and politicians gathered in a ballroom and flocked around him, pressing in to take selfies and shake hands.When the formal program began, Mr. Bezos was soon asked the obvious: Where would he be opening HQ2? The crowd cheered and whistled at the question, posed with more than a hint that the headquarters should be right there in the region, then playfully booed as Mr. Bezos demurred.\u201cBe nice,\u201d Mr. Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person, pleaded with a laugh.And while Washington and Maryland are reliably Democratic, Virginia is more of a swing state, giving Amazon potential champions from both parties.\u201cIf you had your headquarters in a city and were responsible for tens of thousands of jobs, you could be seen as a good corporate citizen,\u201d said Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto who has followed Amazon\u2019s urban development for more than two decades.The headquarters search centers on Amazon\u2019s seemingly insatiable appetite to hire enough of the talent it needs. To do so, the company says, it needs to be somewhere with a strong talent pipeline and the urban attributes, like public transportation and culture, that attract other employees to move.\u201cPeople want to be where there is vibrancy at the street level,\u201d said Jodie McLean, chief executive of Edens, a developer who has worked around the region and is involved with Washington\u2019s bid.The region is home to one of the most educated work forces in the country. Amazon already has a growing presence, with more than 2,500 employees in corporate and technical roles, like lobbyists in Washington and engineers at data centers in the Virginia suburbs serving government contracts.Crystal City is about as close to Washington as possible while still being in Virginia. It\u2019s one Metro stop away from National Airport, and just a few stops across the Potomac River from Washington.\u201cIt is a dense, up-and-coming, mixed-used area that has a lot of opportunity for more development,\u201d Ms. Liu said.Other locations in Northern Virginia fit many of Amazon\u2019s requirements. But they\u2019re more suburban, and being in the middle of Seattle has become a central part of Amazon\u2019s identity.One question that looms over Crystal City, and Northern Virginia more broadly, is whether it is hip enough for the employees Amazon wants to attract. Crystal City is a jumble of mostly outdated, low-slung offices built decades ago for defense contractors, and a smattering of retail outlets. That has left it with a high vacancy rate, around 20 percent, according to JLL, a commercial real estate brokerage.JBG Smith, a publicly traded investment trust, owns large swaths of Crystal City, and its chief executive, Matt Kelly, spoke before Mr. Bezos at the Economic Club, fueling yet another round of speculation among HQ2 watchers.\u201cEverybody is talking about Crystal City,\u201d said Stephen S. Fuller, a leading regional economist at George Mason University. \u201cThe fit is good.\u201dJBG Smith has big plans for Crystal City and has already signed Alamo Drafthouse, the movie theater chain, to anchor a new retail district. It\u2019s working with the local government to convert a highway that bisects the area into a more pleasant, tree-lined boulevard.\u201cSome of the dreaming that is going on is just waiting for an accelerant, and that\u2019s what I think Amazon would be,\u201d Dr. Fuller said.Among some in the region\u2019s real estate crowd, it has become almost a joke that Mr. Bezos should buy JBG Smith outright.\u201cIf you are an opportunist, it looks like this would be of interest,\u201d Dr. Fuller said. \u201cAnd clearly Amazon has been opportunistic in their whole history.\u201dAmazon may not have the patience and trust that Northern Virginia can be transformed, especially when Washington already is so rich, right across the Potomac.\u201cThe District has magnificent neighborhoods and magnificent urbanity,\u201d Professor Florida said.Like everyone who guesses where HQ2 may land, he added a big caveat. \u201cI\u2019m not in Jeff Bezos\u2019 mind,\u201d he said.Cecilia Kang contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why You Have Adult Acne, and How to Get Rid of It", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySkin DeepAs the incidence of adult acne rises to \u201cepidemic proportions,\u201d pimple products designed for grown-ups \u2014 acne patches, among them \u2014 are quickly catching on. Michael McGeever, the company\u2019s chief merchandising and product officer, wasn\u2019t surprised. After all, Beautycounter\u2019s some 35,000 consultants (think Avon model) had long been clamoring for pimple solutions for themselves and their clients.\u201cThe assumption is that acne is no longer an issue for adult women,\u201d Mr. McGeever said. \u201cBut they were telling us that\u2019s not true.\u201dIndeed. A 2018 review of studies in the journal Clinical, Cosmetic and Investigational Dermatology reported a significant increase in adult acne (which overwhelmingly occurs in women), though there is little consensus yet as to just how precipitous the rise is. Whitney Bowe, a dermatologist in New York and a member of the American Academy of Dermatology\u2019s acne working group, used the term \u201cepidemic proportions.\u201d In Dr. Bowe\u2019s own practice, she said that the fraction of adult female patients with acne jumped from \u201csignificant\u201d five years ago to \u201chalf of them\u201d three years ago. Today, it\u2019s nearly all of them \u2014 to the point that the rare woman without acne is notable.\u201cThat feels like more the exception these days,\u201d Dr. Bowe said.Not surprisingly, beauty companies have taken notice, introducing blemish products designed for grown-ups. Net-a-Porter\u2019s skin care offerings (of which acne-related products are the \u201cvast majority\u201d) grew 90 percent in the last year; there was triple-digit growth before that, said Newby Hands, the site\u2019s global beauty director.Doctors don\u2019t yet fully understand what\u2019s causing the recent breakout of \u2026 well, breakouts. They think the red angry bumps and pus pimples they usually see on adult women \u2014 almost universally in so-called surgical-mask distribution (the lower third of the face) \u2014 can be blamed on multiple things. Environmental factors like stress can send oil glands into overdrive, while high glycemic diets have been associated with acne. (So have skim milk and whey protein, though studies on the latter have been done only with men.)Hormones are another factor. Birth control pills are being prescribed ever younger and more frequently, so when women stop taking them, sometimes 20 years later, it\u2019s the first time the oil glands are subject to the normal cyclical changes of hormones.\u201cWe theorize that the skin is going through a new puberty,\u201d said Joshua Zeichner, the director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital. (Why are pimples on the lower third of the face? The current hypothesis is that, as with male pattern baldness, it\u2019s a hormone sensitivity issue.)Finally, the sheer number of products women pile on may be to blame for \u201cpomade acne,\u201d so named for pimple-causing hair ointments but now used to refer to breakouts from any occlusive product. Too many acne treatments can cause inflammation, which itself can cause pore blockage. Also at issue is what Dr. Zeichner called \u201c21-step skin care routines,\u201d which may or may not be effective. Combining multiple products may inactivate the hero ingredients in each, and using the wrong things \u201ccan certainly cause an acne flare,\u201d he said.Dr. Zeichner, who sees double the number of adult female acne patients now compared to five years ago, suggested that after cleansing, any more than three steps in the morning or evening is \u201ctoo much.\u201d His preferred regimen is even simpler: serum and sunscreen in the morning; moisturizer and a therapeutic product in the evening. He also advised giving products a monthlong trial to see results. No active ingredient works instantly unless it\u2019s a hydrator or a plumper, which are only temporary benefits.When choosing products, respect the skin barrier. In adult acne sufferers, the skin is often dry and sensitive, and unable to tolerate the same treatments (or the same levels of ingredients) as robust teenage oily skin. If you\u2019re using a leave-on product with a potential irritant \u2014 like the common zit treatments benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid \u2014 avoid using a cleanser with irritants. (A rule of thumb: ones labeled \u201cacne-fighting\u201d or \u201cpore-refining.\u201d)\u201cWomen in their 40s are coming to see me, saying, \u2018I\u2019ve still got this mark three weeks later,\u2019\u201d she said. Pimple poppers \u2014 or \u201clesion manipulators,\u201d if you like academic journal terms: Consider yourselves warned.To speed the healing process, Ms. Chapman created SOS spot stickers, or thin translucent patches that deliver salicylic acid to the site of the pimple while keeping bacteria \u2014 and the wearer\u2019s fingers \u2014 away.Ms. Chapman\u2019s offering, packaged in a handbag friendly white leather carrying case with a mirror, is one of a fast-growing new type of treatment: acne patches, which can be medicated (as Ms. Chapman\u2019s are) or unmedicated. What good is an unmedicated patch? It is designed to suck out fluids, which flattens the pimple and reduces redness. These patches are also known as hydrocolloid dressings, which for decades could be found on the pharmacy\u2019s wound-treatment shelf, just not in any format you\u2019d want to put on your face, let alone wear in public.She quickly became obsessed with the patches \u2014 \u201cI thought, \u2018Why am I first discovering them in my 30s?\u2019\u201d she said \u2014 testing some 40 different kinds to determine optimum size, stickiness and absorption powers. Ms. Rhyu\u2019s own unmedicated Mighty Patch ($12.99 for 36) was introduced in September 2017 and quickly picked up by retailers like Madewell and Neiman Marcus. The company will reach seven-figure sales this year, she said.(Ms. Rhyu\u2019s success has, somewhat ironically, spawned Chinese knockoffs; she bought a letter-perfect copy on Amazon and posted a photo to her Instagram Stories with the caption \u201cImitation is flattery?\u201d and a pondering emoji.)Ms. Rhyu said she initially was surprised by the age of her customers, some of whom are in their 50s and 60s.\u201cThere\u2019s never a good time to have a pimple,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Has All the Tab Gone? A Shortage Panics Fans", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe plea for Tab came across in a message on Facebook.It was Sept. 27, and Anne White saw a post from a neighbor telling her their local grocery store in Cincinnati had been stripped of the diet soda, last popular in the 1980s and now a cult favorite.Ms. White, 56, had 10 cans stashed in a cupboard and agreed to leave them on the porch. The next morning, two were gone. Since then, Ms. White has not been able to find Tab anywhere in town. She reserved a few cases online at a Target near Wilmington, N.C. But when she went to buy them, it was sold out.\u201cA friend brought me three cases from Atlanta,\u201d she said. Those are sure to go fast too.\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit sad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Ms. White said.Sad is one word for it. Fans of Tab \u2014 who often call themselves Tab addicts or Tabaholics \u2014 have another word: conspiracy. Rumors abounded in recent weeks about why their favorite fizzy drink had been whisked off shelves from Cincinnati to Charlotte, N.C.Some speculated that the Coca-Cola Company, which has been making the soft drink since 1963, had quietly discontinued it. On Wednesday, the company said this was not true.Others blamed Coca-Cola Bottling Company Consolidated, the largest independent bottler and distributor of Coca-Cola products in the United States. Devotees of the drink who called customer service in recent weeks said they were told that the bottler had discontinued offering Tab in stores in portions of its 14-state territory, which includes Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina and the District of Columbia.This, the bottler says, is true. \u201cAfter careful review, we recently removed Tab 12-pack cans from the portfolio of beverages we offer,\u201d the company said in a statement. Instead, it said, it will focus on low- and no-calorie Coca-Cola, Sprite, Fresca and Seagram\u2019s products.For lovers of Tab it is the latest attempt to take away their beloved soda, a steady threat since Coca-Cola introduced Diet Coke in 1982.\u201cWe\u2019ve been through this before,\u201d said Calvin Boyd, 51, a Tab drinker for four decades who works in the cargo department at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina. \u201cWe know what to do.\u201dMr. Boyd said a friend of his approached the manager of a Publix supermarket in Charlotte about restocking the shelves. The manager offered to secure a shipment from a Publix in Florida.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a drug deal,\u201d Mr. Boyd said. \u201c\u2018Hey man, can you get me a fix?\u2019 I\u2019m a little bit traumatized.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like a real cult community,\u201d said Ms. Kueneman, whose brother is an editor at The Times. \u201cI get five to 10 emails a month from people asking where they can find Tab.\u201dTab lovers refused to give up, building networks of friends and colleagues who advised them where to buy it. Ms. Kueneman said she could not find Tab in San Francisco when she lived there. So she sometimes hired a courier to drive 90 miles north to Sacramento and pick up several cases for her.Mr. Boyd of Charlotte has a group of friends who alert each other when store shipments come in. He said he occasionally buys Tab online, although it is costly. \u201cWith shipping, I once paid nearly $40 for a case,\u201d he said.Tracy Bowen, a bookkeeper from Fredericksburg, Va., has been drinking Tab since she was 15. \u201cSometimes I get a cinnamon hit,\u201d she said of the taste. \u201cIt\u2019s the closest thing to a real cola taste without the sugar.\u201dMs. Bowen said that in 1992 she asked her then husband to go to the store to stock up on Tab ahead of a snowstorm. \u201cHe runs into another lady\u2019s husband buying some too,\u201d she recalled. But there was only one case. \u201cSo they split what was left between the two of them,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t want to go home without it.\u201dEllen Roddy of Lexington, Ky., has called Coca-Cola\u2019s customer service to complain and started a petition on Facebook. In the meantime, she asked a friend to pick some up for her in Alabama, but he didn\u2019t have time. She also said she was going to buy it on Amazon, but $20 for the 12-pack she saw online was too steep. She is considering driving to Indiana to see if stores carry it there.\u201cMaybe they thought us Tab people would switch over to Diet Coke,\u201d she said.Not so. Instead, she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been drinking a lot more water.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "There Is a Silver Lining for Losers of Amazon\u2019s HQ2 Competition", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsWinning and losing may not be quite what they seem in the competition for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters.The $860 billion e-commerce company will soon decide where it\u2019s so-called HQ2 will be based. Only one of 20 finalist locations will be chosen, but the company invests and hires prodigiously in many urban areas \u2014 and will surely continue to do so.Mayors and governors from across North America have been making offers to Amazon since September 2017, when the company asked local governments to submit pitches to host a second corporate base that will complement its Seattle home. Amazon promised $5 billion in investment and 50,000 jobs over 10 to 15 years.New Jersey officials offered more than $7 billion in tax breaks for Newark\u2019s entry. Maryland estimated that its incentives on behalf of Montgomery County, adjacent to Washington, D.C., would be worth $5 billion.Victory will bring burdens as well as benefits. First is covering the cost of the incentives. Wisconsin\u2019s budget office believes that it will take 25 years to recoup the $3 billion in tax breaks that it granted to Taiwan\u2019s Foxconn last year for a liquid-crystal display plant built in the area. (And that doesn\u2019t include the subsequent $764 million in incentives from Racine County, which prompted Moody\u2019s to downgrade the county\u2019s debt rating.)Amazon and its planned 50,000 employees will also strain infrastructure. Home prices in Seattle have risen faster than anywhere in the United States except San Francisco since the Standard & Poor\u2019s CoreLogic Case-Shiller home price indexes began tracking real estate values 18 years ago. It\u2019s difficult to see how New Jersey could afford to spend lavishly on Amazon when the state a few years ago canceled a multi-billion-dollar overhaul of a critical century-old train link to New York City.Losers won\u2019t have those worries, and many will get a boost from Amazon anyway.According to the company\u2019s figures, it has invested more than $4 billion and taken on more than 5,000 employees in New Jersey alone between 2011 and 2017, which is roughly half the time span of the promised HQ2 development. Over the same period, Virginia secured $29 billion of investment and over 8,500 jobs from Amazon. Even Tennessee, which is home to the finalist city of Nashville, has received more than $5 billion of investment and 6,500 jobs.More of that kind of investment will be a handsome consolation prize \u2014 and the losers won\u2019t have any giveaways to justify, either.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Trolls Reigned Free: A New History of Reddit", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Even then, at a moment of techno-optimism we are unlikely to see again in our lifetimes, Reddit was a toxic swamp. It was the place you went, shrouded in anonymity, for pornography, hard-core racism, revenge porn, Nazi cheerleading, Jew-baiting, creepshots, fat-shaming, mindless anarchy and pictures of dead kids or of women who had been beaten. If anyone bothered to look, Reddit was proof that on the internet, the trolls were in charge.Founded in 2005, soon after Facebook, Reddit has always been something of an anomaly among companies whose content was generated by users. Its founders, barely out of their teens, had no real vision. It wasn\u2019t even their idea. They cashed out as soon as they could. The buyer was Cond\u00e9 Nast, home of America\u2019s toniest magazines, but executives there had no vision either. Reddit was created by millions of Americans with a taste for darkness. You can\u2019t blame this one on Vladimir Putin.In the beginning, Reddit users simply shared links about interesting things they read. Then comments were added. The job of moderating was assigned to anonymous volunteers, who created and shaped \u201csubreddits\u201d to their own passions. This was a genius move: It allowed Reddit not only to keep its staff lean, but to distance the company from the sleazier content.Christine Lagorio-Chafkin, a writer for Inc. magazine, tells the Reddit story in \u201cWe Are the Nerds.\u201d The two co-founders, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, cooperated extensively. I admire them for doing so because despite Lagorio-Chafkin\u2019s best efforts \u2014 Ohanian is called \u201ccharismatic\u201d or celebrated for his \u201ccharisma\u201d on Pages 47, 158, 214, 223 and 330 \u2014 they come off as whiny and callow schemers, and not the sharpest of sticks. On the very first page, the two University of Virginia seniors cannot figure out what a \u201ckiosk\u201d is.The title \u201cWe Are the Nerds\u201d doesn\u2019t really fit the tale. \u201cWe Are the Trolls\u201d would have made much more sense. \u201cI was always kind of an [expletive],\u201d Huffman explains early on. Lagorio-Chafkin bluntly calls him \u201ca total troll.\u201d He was also a genius programmer. The great achievement of the social internet was to unleash jerkdom for many while monetizing it for a few.The Reddit tale is an indictment of Silicon Valley, something Lagorio-Chafkin seems to sense but never confronts head-on, perhaps because she is so grateful for access to Huffman and Ohanian. \u201cTwo nice guys who made it, by crafting something incredible and yet ridiculously unwieldy, with no lack of turbulence along the way,\u201d Lagorio-Chafkin writes in an author\u2019s note. A more accurate summation might be: \u201cTwo inexperienced young guys created something they didn\u2019t understand and couldn\u2019t control.\u201dIt\u2019s all here anyway: the lack of adult oversight; the suck-up press; the growth-at-any-cost mentality; the loyal employees, by turns abused and abusive (memo from management: \u201cYou do realize you were talking about penises for 90 minutes, right?\u201d); the defense of horrendous behavior as \u201cfree speech\u201d; the jettisoning of \u201cfree speech\u201d when it served corporate purposes; the way no one seeks permission but all expect forgiveness.\u201cWe Are the Nerds\u201d is most compelling when it tells the story of a third young man who played a founding role at Reddit. Aaron Swartz was brilliant, troubled and impossible, but he saw the tech economy more clearly than well-medicated people. \u201cIn the old days the new money was made through theft and abuse of office,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNow any random computer programmer \u2014 or even the people who hung around them \u2014 could find themselves saddled with a pile of cash.\u201d In early 2013, hounded by the government over a stupid stunt involving the downloading of academic journals, Swartz committed suicide.Reddit became so offensive it was difficult to work there. A community manager who had a brief tenure in 2015 told Lagorio-Chafkin some of the reasons: \u201cChild molesters, child porn, vicious stalking, rape threats, serious harassment, people taking the harassment offline and people filing police reports on each other.\u201d One chief executive, stressed beyond endurance, simply stopped showing up for work. His replacement, Ellen Pao, tried to impose order in the office and on the site. The backlash led to her abrupt departure. Huffman returned and purged most of the staff.The charismatic Ohanian came back as well, trying a few Reddit spinoffs that fizzled. He is best known now for being Mr. Serena Williams. I wondered if any of his new relatives ever asked him about the popular subreddit called CoonTown \u2014 you can guess the contents \u2014 but \u201cWe Are the Nerds\u201d is silent on this. CoonTown was finally banned by Reddit in 2015.I also saw a lot of ads. Reddit is worth about $2 billion, which means Advance Publications, the parent of Cond\u00e9 Nast and now Reddit\u2019s biggest investor, made good money.

(The plan is said to be a backup, in case a meeting next month between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China doesn\u2019t yield results.) The tariffs could cover about $257 billion worth of goods \u2014 including popular items like iPhones and Nike sneakers.The decision, which came after the American chip maker Micron accused Jinhua of intellectual property theft, could be a crippling blow to the Chinese company. (And it drew comparisons to the Trump administration\u2019s harsh actions against ZTE earlier this year.) The penalties will delay China\u2019s effort to establish a homegrown chip industry that doesn\u2019t rely on American parts.Behind that volatility were continuing investor concerns that tech stocks are overvalued.

But it has become glaringly apparent that the companies never quite understood the negative consequences of that influence nor what to do about it \u2014 and that they cannot put the genie back in the bottle.The chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, announced the initiative as part of the nation\u2019s annual budget. The new charge, scheduled to go into effect in 2020, would apply only to organizations with global revenue of at least 500 million pounds, or about $640 million. The government will ask for 2 percent of revenue the companies generate in Britain. Mr. Hammond said the plan could eventually raise as much as \u00a3400 million annually.But the tech industry is unimpressed. The Information Technology Industry Council, which represents the likes of Google and Facebook, said that \u201cimposing a digital tax could create a chilling effect on investment in the U.K. and hinder businesses of all sizes from creating jobs.\u201dMs. Merkel\u2019s retreat, analysts say, could mark the beginning of a new era not just for Europe\u2019s biggest country but for the Continent itself.It could leave Germany more unstable and less able to take the lead in Europe at a time when leadership is badly needed on an array of topics \u2014 from Britain\u2019s imminent departure from the European Union to Italy\u2019s controversial budget plans.Stefan Koopman, an economist at Rabobank, offered a bleak assessment to the NYT: \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a worse time for Germany\u2019s steady ship to hit choppy waters.\u201dLegally required officers of a corporation are president, treasurer & secretary.

{"Headline": "Google Retreats from Berlin Plan Opposed by Local Groups", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 What Google wants, Google usually gets, but in Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg neighborhood, residents have won a battle against the internet giant, which backed away from a project in the face of local opposition.Google had planned to convert an old electric company building in Kreuzberg into an incubator for tech start-ups, the kind of development that could have altered the fabric of the funky, multicultural area.Instead, the company announced on Wednesday that after sinking millions of dollars into the project, it will make the space available, free of charge, to nonprofit social service and local advocacy groups \u2014 a move its adversaries welcomed.The decision handed a surprise victory to anti-gentrification groups who had protested Google\u2019s plan, but some city officials saw it as a lost economic opportunity and a stain on Berlin\u2019s vaunted tech-friendly reputation.Kreuzberg has long been one of the most affordable areas of Berlin, making it a haven for students, immigrants, artists and activists, a hub of culture, night life and left-wing politics. But in a pattern repeated in similar neighborhoods in many of the world\u2019s wealthiest cities, affluent people have moved in, too, in recent years, bringing with them the social tensions of gentrification.\u201cThey push out the people who were here before,\u201d said Achim Koppitsch, 60, who runs a vinyl record store in Kreuzberg. \u201cYou can\u2019t find any more cool places \u2014 instead you get hipster cafes that roast their own beans.\u201dResidents opposed to the Kreuzberg project worried about tech salaries driving up rents in a neighborhood already dotted with new restaurants that local residents cannot afford. But reasons for the opposition went beyond gentrification: Some people were opposed to Google because of its data collection and tax avoidance practices.\u201cBecause it was Google, it was always bigger than just an anti-gentrification fight,\u201d said Konstantin Sergiou, a neighborhood activist who worked against the project. \u201cWe were lucky.\u201dLocal resistance to such projects is fairly common. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, has faced opposition in Toronto, where it plans to redevelop a section of waterfront, and a Google plan to overhaul an area of San Jose, Calif., has faced criticism.But cities often see the gentrification that comes with an influx of tech workers as a good problem to have, and they compete with one another to attract big companies. Amazon\u2019s plans to open a second headquarters drew more than 200 bids.In Berlin\u2019s city government, opinion is split.Sebastian Czaja, the head of the pro-business Federal Democrats faction in Berlin\u2019s House of Representatives, said that Google\u2019s retreat will discourage other companies from settling in the city, which bills itself as the start-up capital of Europe.\u201cEven if the new use of the venue is welcome, the message to all future companies and investors is fatal: Do not come to Berlin, certainly not to Kreuzberg,\u201d he said in a statement.Progressive politicians lauded Google for its decision to focus on social services, charities and neighborhood groups.\u201cThere is a lot of potential for solving societal challenges,\u201d said Ramona Pop of the Greens, the city senator responsible for the economy, in a statement praising Google\u2019s announcement.Mr. Koppitsch\u2019s record store, across the street from the Google site, is typical of the old Kreuzberg, an informal community center where people come to chat and browse through the 10,000 discs.\u201cI think it\u2019s a very positive turn of events, and doing something social is much in tune with what Kreuzberg is about,\u201d he said.Ulrike Ebeling, 46, of GIZ, a corporation that works with the government in international aid and development, says she sees herself as a recently arrived gentrifier. Doing her wash in a Kreuzberg laundromat, she said she understood the local groups\u2019 arguments, but was not sure Google\u2019s withdrawal was good for the city.\u201cI think it would be good for a capital to have some big employers, not just the big stodgy government as an employer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut does it have to be in Kreuzberg? I don\u2019t know.\u201dGoogle, which first announced plans in late 2016 to open a 32,000-square-foot start-up campus, said this week that it had taken note of the protests, but took pains to counter the idea that it had been pressured into changing its plans. An incubator specifically for start-ups was no longer as needed as it was two years ago, the company said.\u201cFrom the beginning, our goal with the campus was not only to create a space for start-ups, but also to open the space up to social organizations,\u201d Rowan Barnett, the head of Google for start-ups in Germany, said in a statement.\u201cBut to do it, you need friends like Google on your side,\u201d he said.Adam Satariano contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bishops Urge Greater Inclusion of Women in Church Decisions", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVATICAN CITY \u2014 After a nearly monthlong global assembly dedicated to youths, Roman Catholic bishops called Saturday for a more inclusive role for women in church decision-making and greater participation of young people.The appeal was part of a new document that urged bishops to help renew the church through a more participatory approach, making greater use of the energies and capabilities of young lay Catholics.The document given to Pope Francis for his consideration also called for urgent changes so that women could play a bigger role in church decisions at all levels.\u201cIt is a duty of justice,\u201d it said, adding, \u201cThe absence of women\u2019s voices and viewpoint impoverishes discussion and the path of the church.\u201dThe document also acknowledged the church\u2019s shortcomings amid new revelations on clerics\u2019 sexual abuse of minors, a continuing global scandal that has damaged the church\u2019s credibility in recent years and that risks undermining attempts to engage younger generations.The Synod of Bishops, as the assembly is known, \u201crecognizes that dealing with the question of abuse, in all its aspects, with the precious help of young people, can really be an opportunity for an epochal reform,\u201d the document said.It praised those who had called out their abusers, and admitted that many past cases had been badly handled. Several of the participants said throughout the three-week gathering that the abuse issue had weighed on the discussions.But some said a more appropriate venue for discussing the topic would be a meeting at the Vatican that Francis has called for February with the presidents of more than 130 bishops\u2019 conferences.Many had hoped for more from the document.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the same old stuff,\u201d said Francis DeBernardo, executive director of New Ways Ministry, an advocacy group for gay Catholics, who said the Vatican would have had a better understanding of the complexities of the issue had one of the 34 young lay auditors at the synod been gay.The working draft of the document given to bishops at the beginning of the synod, for example, specifically used the acronym L.G.B.T. \u2014 for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender \u2014 while the final draft did not. Some Catholics had welcomed its use as a sign that the church was listening to them by speaking their language.While the final draft renewed the church\u2019s \u201ccommitment against every discrimination and sexually based violence,\u201d that section got the most negative votes: 65 \u201cno\u201d votes, and 178 in favor.In receiving the document from the synod participants on Saturday \u2014 249 clerics with voting rights as well as about 90 more experts and auditors \u2014 Pope Francis described the synod as \u201ca protected space\u201d where the Holy Spirit could operate.This is the third synod convened by Francis, now in the fifth year of his papacy; one in the Amazon region is scheduled for next year.Compared with the previous two synods on the family, when the issue of giving communion to divorced and remarried Catholics provoked open dissent against Francis, the participants spoke of an open, enthusiastic and relaxed atmosphere. Many credited the presence of 34 auditors between the ages of 18 and 29.In accordance with Francis\u2019 vision of a bottom-up church, the document calls for young people to take on leadership roles within their Catholic communities and dioceses, working alongside, and not under, priests and bishops to build stronger church networks.One concrete suggestion in the document was the establishment of an international advisory board of young people.In a letter written to the pope, and read to him Friday evening during an impromptu variety show, the 34 youths who participated in the synod told Francis they shared his vision for \u201can outgoing church, open to all, especially the weakest, a field hospital church.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A.I. Is Helping Scientists Predict When and Where the Next Big Earthquake Will Be", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Countless dollars and entire scientific careers have been dedicated to predicting where and when the next big earthquake will strike. But unlike weather forecasting, which has significantly improved with the use of better satellites and more powerful mathematical models, earthquake prediction has been marred by repeated failure.Some of the world\u2019s most destructive earthquakes \u2014 China in 2008, Haiti in 2010 and Japan in 2011, among them \u2014 occurred in areas that seismic hazard maps had deemed relatively safe. The last large earthquake to strike Los Angeles, Northridge in 1994, occurred on a fault that did not appear on seismic maps.Now, with the help of artificial intelligence, a growing number of scientists say changes in the way they can analyze massive amounts of seismic data can help them better understand earthquakes, anticipate how they will behave, and provide quicker and more accurate early warnings.\u201cI am actually hopeful for the first time in my career that we will make progress on this problem,\u201d said Paul Johnson, a fellow at the Los Alamos National Laboratory who is among those at the forefront of this research.Well aware of past earthquake prediction failures, scientists are cautious when asked how much progress they have made using A.I. Some in the field refer to prediction as \u201cthe P word,\u201d because they do not even want to imply it is possible. But one important goal, they say, is to be able to provide reliable forecasts.The earthquake probabilities that are provided on seismic hazard maps, for example, have crucial consequences, most notably in instructing engineers how they should construct buildings. Critics say these maps are remarkably inexact.A map of Los Angeles lists the probability of an earthquake producing strong shaking within a given period of time \u2014 usually 50 years. That is based on a complex formula that takes into account, among other things, the distance from a fault, how fast one side of a fault is moving past the other, and the recurrence of earthquakes in the area.A study led by Katherine M. Scharer, a geologist with the United States Geological Survey, estimated dates for nine previous earthquakes along the Southern California portion of the San Andreas fault dating back to the eighth century. The last big earthquake on the San Andreas was in 1857.Since the average interval between these big earthquakes was 135 years, a common interpretation is that Southern California is due for a big earthquake. Yet the intervals between earthquakes are so varied \u2014 ranging from 44 years to 305 years \u2014 that taking the average is not a very useful prediction tool. A big earthquake could come tomorrow, or it could come in a century and a half or more.This is one of the criticisms of Philip Stark, an associate dean at the University of California, Berkeley, at the Division of Mathematical and Physical Sciences. Dr. Stark describes the overall system of earthquake probabilities as \u201csomewhere between meaningless and misleading\u201d and has called for it to be scrapped.Scientists say seismic data is remarkably similar to the audio data that companies like Google and Amazon use in training neural networks to recognize spoken commands on coffee-table digital assistants like Alexa. When studying earthquakes, it is the computer looking for patterns in mountains of data rather than relying on the weary eyes of a scientist.\u201cRather than a sequence of words, we have a sequence of ground-motion measurements,\u201d said Zachary Ross, a researcher in the California Institute of Technology\u2019s Seismological Laboratory who is exploring these A.I. techniques. \u201cWe are looking for the same kinds of patterns in this data.\u201dHis first project showed that, at the very least, these machine-learning methods could significantly accelerate his experiments. He and his graduate students used a neural network to run an earthquake analysis 500 times faster than they could in the past. What once took days now took minutes.Dr. Meade also found that these A.I. techniques could lead to new insights. In the fall, with other researchers from Google and Harvard, he published a paper showing how neural networks can forecast earthquake aftershocks. This kind of project, he believes, represents an enormous shift in the way earthquake science is done. Similar work is underway at places like Caltech and Stanford University.\u201cWe are at a point where the technology can do as well as \u2014 or better than \u2014 human experts,\u201d Dr. Ross said.Driving that guarded optimism is the belief that as sensors get smaller and cheaper, scientists will be able to gather larger amounts of seismic data. With help from neural networks and similar A.I. techniques, they hope to glean new insights from all this data.Dr. Ross and other Caltech researchers are using these techniques to build systems that can more accurately recognize earthquakes as they are happening and anticipate where the epicenter is and where the shaking will spread.Japan and Mexico have early warning systems, and California just rolled out its own. But scientists say artificial intelligence could greatly improve their accuracy, helping predict the direction and intensity of a rupture in the earth\u2019s crust and providing earlier warnings to hospitals and other institutions that could benefit from a few extra seconds of preparation.\u201cThe more detail you have, the better your forecasts will be,\u201d Dr. Ross said.Scientists working on these projects said neural networks have their limits. Though they are good at finding familiar signals in data, they are not necessarily suited to finding new kinds of signals \u2014 like the sounds tectonic plates make as they grind together.But at Los Alamos, Dr. Johnson and his colleagues have shown that a machine-learning technique called \u201crandom forests\u201d can identify previously unknown signals in a simulated fault created inside a lab. In one case, their system showed that a particular sound made by the fault, which scientists previously thought was meaningless, was actually an indication of when an earthquake would arrive.Some scientists, like Robert Geller, a seismologist at the University of Tokyo, are unconvinced that A.I. will improve earthquake forecasts. He questions the very premise that past earthquakes can predict future ones. And ultimately, he said, we would only know the effectiveness of A.I. forecasting when earthquakes can be predicted beyond random chance.\u201cThere are no shortcuts,\u201d Dr. Geller said. \u201cIf you cannot predict the future, then your hypothesis is wrong.\u201dAdvertisement"}

They were perfectly clear \u2014 a sign of freshness.\u201cSee that beauty?\u201d said Mr. Dufays, his breath forming clouds in the glacial air. \u201cIt was caught this morning in Brittany, by independent fishermen in small boats.\u201dA buyer from a swank Parisian restaurant came by to inspect the fish, haggle over the price and secure delivery in time for a well-heeled lunch crowd later that day.Throughout the early morning, thousands of similar deals were unfolding inside more than 30 hulking meat, fruit, vegetable, dairy and flower pavilions nearby.By the time the sun peeked over the Paris skyline, throngs of workers had consumed nearly 3,000 coffees at Le Saint Hubert cafe, a local hangout, squeezed elbow-to-elbow at the horseshoe bar.\u201cThis is a working-class place,\u201d said Pascal Rolland, 56, a butcher, sipping white wine in a bloodstained apron at 5:30 a.m. after hacking meat carcasses all night. \u201cThere\u2019s no one here who doesn\u2019t work hard.\u201dWhen Les Halles outgrew its soaring glass-and-steel halls in central Paris, Gen. Charles de Gaulle, the president at the time, ordered it relocated to the suburb of Rungis.\u201cIf we don\u2019t press the fishmonger, the vegetable seller and the butcher to go digital, we\u2019ll disappear,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Layani, the president of Semmaris.But the idea of becoming cybermerchants has stirred a subtle \u201cr\u00e9sistance\u201d among many of Rungis\u2019s longtime denizens, most of them second- or third-generation sellers. Their forebears negotiated t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with buyers in Les Halles, a pen behind their ears to mark up orders and ledgers.\u201cIt\u2019s na\u00efve to think this can be done by computer,\u201d said Mr. Dufays, 58, pointing to stacks of brill and monkfish waiting to be sold. \u201cPeople need to see the fish, touch it, make sure it\u2019s fresh. You can\u2019t do that through a screen.\u201dThe only remote purchases he fielded were telephone orders from buyers who knew the quality of his goods.The prospect of earning fatter profits online, though, is alluring to many merchants here.J\u00e9r\u00f4me Desmettre, the president and a fourth-generation produce seller, said his grandfather traveled to farms with a wooden carriage to gather apples for resale. Today, Mr. Desmettre goes online to buy his cherries from Brazil, and has peaches delivered by train from southern France.Others aren\u2019t convinced of the online approach. Aurore Boussac, 30, a Parisian florist, stopped ordering online after receiving wilted flowers. Since then, she has resumed visiting Rungis to inspect tulips, roses and other blooms personally.\u201cWe\u2019re artisans,\u201d Ms. Boussac said. \u201cWe need to know what we\u2019re buying.\u201dMost important, she added, gesturing to the longtime flower sellers in the hall, \u201cwe have a relationship with the people here.\u201dWhether a deal is sealed among wheels of cheese or over a bottle of Bordeaux in a wood-paneled Rungis restaurant, such bonds are indispensable. And that extends to the relationships among the workers. Despite the market\u2019s vastness, it\u2019s more like a Proven\u00e7al village where food, work and pride transcend boundaries and bind people together.\u201cIf you\u2019re willing to work hard, you\u2019ll find a job,\u201d he said as a man swung a cleaver at a veal carcass. Mr. Fauch\u00e8re said he paid his workers nearly twice the minimum wage, and passes on his savoir-faire to give them skills for continued employment.Antoine D\u2019Agostino, 82, began working at age 12 in the teeming food pavilions in Les Halles, hauling produce in wooden carts.\u201cI never had time to go to school,\u201d said Mr. D\u2019Agostino, lingering with his memories over an early morning cappuccino. \u201cBut I knew how to count.\u201dMr. D\u2019Agostino, a celebrity at the market, offered some memories of his early days in the business.Today, Mr. D\u2019Agostino helps his son run a wine wholesale business at Rungis, with Champagnes and Ch\u00e2teau P\u00e9trus available on site and online.Still, with e-commerce, \u201cthere\u2019s no one who says hello or even thank you,\u201d he observed.\u201cPeople want to be treated like humans,\u201d he added. \u201cThe market is where that happens.\u201dEmma Bubola contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

He received at least $60.7 million in loans, many never repaid.\u2022 Fred Trump grossly undervalued properties that he passed onto his children, dodging hundreds of millions in gift taxes.\u2022 The Trumps created a company that inflated the value of equipment purchased for their housing units and passed the difference onto the Trump children. One tax expert said that might have constituted criminal tax fraud.A lawyer for Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the NYT.Its Model 3 output nearly doubled, into the 50,000-to-55,000 range that Mr. Musk had predicted.

How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Kevin Roose, a technology columnist in New York who has been writing about disinformation online, discussed the tech he\u2019s using.Q. As a technology columnist, what are some of your favorite tech tools for work?When I really need to get work done, I use an app called SelfControl, which blocks my access to certain potentially distracting websites for a set period of time. Mine is set to block Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Reddit, and I usually set it for two or three hours at a time.I also bought noise-canceling headphones this year, because my colleagues, God love them, are always talking on the phone with their sources. I\u2019m pretty into a Spotify playlist called Focus Flow, which is perfect for drowning out their lovely, incessant yakking.What are some of the trade-offs of using this tech?I like taking physical notes because I retain information better when it\u2019s written on actual paper. The downside is that I spend a lot of time scrambling around my apartment looking for the notebook I left in a jacket pocket or under the sofa.There\u2019s also a definite trade-off between security and convenience. I probably spend 30 percent of my day typing in two-factor authentication codes. But I sleep better than I used to.Recently, I\u2019ve also been spending a lot of time on Crowdtangle, a tool that allows you to see what\u2019s spreading rapidly across Facebook at any given moment. (Crowdtangle used to be an independent company, but Facebook bought it in 2016.)

Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world.

Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines.

The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos.

Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture.

Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet.

The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day.

Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times.

At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco.
