{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "In August, amid a leadership shakeup, the Australian government blocked Huawei, a Chinese company whose technology underpins mobile broadband for about half of all Australians, from building the country\u2019s future 5G networks.The ban was made under the pretext of protecting national security, yet there is no evidence that Huawei gear is insecure. Because it is headquartered in China, Huawei has undergone more scrutiny than any other ICT supplier in the world. In several markets, including the U.K., its source code is reviewed by independent security experts. In the 31 years since Huawei\u2019s founding, no public evidence of wrongdoing has ever come to light. Canberra\u2019s decision to ban the company was purely political.Australian citizens will be paying for that decision for decades to come. 5G will form the basis of future broadband networks. By keeping a leading 5G provider out of its market, Australia has reduced the country\u2019s supply of telecommunications infrastructure just as demand for 5G is starting to grow. Basic economics dictates that when supply drops, costs rise. Perhaps that is why Americans live with the second-highest prices in the world for mobile phone services. In the United States, 90 percent of wireless infrastructure sales are made by just two companies, Ericsson and Nokia. Meanwhile, the quality of U.S. mobile service measured by download speeds is ranked 61st in the world, after Chile, Egypt and Peru.National security obviously takes precedence over download speeds. But if security is the goal, banning telecom suppliers on the basis of geographic origin makes no sense. Today\u2019s telecommunications industry is transnational and borderless. Threats can originate anywhere. Programmable code can be implanted virtually in hardware and software, allowing malicious actors to spy or launch a cyberattack. Unauthorized functionality can compromise the product of any company, anywhere in the world.While no evidence exists that Huawei has been compromised by the Chinese government or any other actors, the United States, by contrast, has a long track record of modifying products to achieve its goals. From the 1940s until the early 1990s, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) rigged encryption systems sold by Crypto AG, a Swiss company, enabling the agency to read the coded diplomatic and military traffic of more than 120 countries. Later that decade, it reduced the level of security in non-U.S. versions of internet browsers and email programs made by Lotus Notes, Netscape and Microsoft to make files encrypted with those programs easy to decrypt. More recently, the NSA intercepted Cisco routers and covertly installed spyware on them before they were shipped to customers. The agency\u2019s ongoing Bullrun program places back doors into commercially available cryptographic software and hardware, or weakens the encryption so that the NSA can break the code. Australia\u2019s government does not trust Huawei, or China, or any Chinese company. Nor should they \u2014 in the digital domain, no one should be trusted. Negotiating arms treaties with the Soviet Union, former U.S. President Ronald Regan said that the best approach was to \u201ctrust but verify.\u201d Today, smart governments will dispense with trust and proceed straight to verification. Instead of pointlessly banning individual companies, they will establish comprehensive risk-mitigation procedures based on global best practices. These include hiring independent security experts to review source code and monitoring supply chains for breaches. Any other approach creates an illusion of security that actually increases risk. The news and editorial staffs of The New York Times had no role in this post's preparation."}
{"Headline": "In Liberal San Francisco, Tech Leaders Brawl Over Tax Proposal to Aid Homeless", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJack Dorsey, chief executive of Twitter and Square, is among the technology executives who have been fiercely opposed to a Nov. 6 ballot measure that would impose a new tax on companies.For months, technology companies in San Francisco have fought a local ballot proposition that would impose taxes on corporations to fund initiatives to help the homeless.But last week, that unified front crumbled when Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, the online software company that is the city\u2019s largest private employer, broke from the pack. \u201cHomelessness is all of our responsibility,\u201d he tweeted. Then the billionaire committed $2 million to passing the tax measure and criticized his fellow tech moguls for not caring.The vitriol among tech executives over the proposition has become \u201cawkward,\u201d said Scott Wiener, a Democratic state senator who represents San Francisco and surrounding areas and who is against the tax. Still, he praised the companies for becoming more involved in local politics.The dispute over Proposition C raises the question of what responsibilities tech companies have for problems in their own backyards. Tech firms often receive blame for exacerbating inequality and driving up property values with their hefty employee pay packages, contributing to homelessness. The question of what these companies may owe their hometowns is magnified because many of them have taken advantage of local tax breaks to spur their own growth.\u201cI\u2019m down to help in any way I can, as long as the mayor has the accountability,\u201d Mr. Dorsey said in an interview. He added that he was not worried about being perceived as opposing support for the homeless, \u201cbecause it feels like the right thing to do to get into the nuance and bring out more of the concerns.\u201dThose in favor of the new tax argue that they are not asking tech companies to come up with a strategy to save the homeless. Instead, they said, they simply want to raise taxes on the firms to fund resources. The extra money from the proposition could total $300 million a year and would effectively double the city\u2019s budget for addressing homelessness.\u201cYou\u2019re either for the homeless or you\u2019re not,\u201d Mr. Benioff said in an interview. \u201cEveryone is willing to say it\u2019s a terrible problem and it\u2019s getting worse, but only so many are willing to write a check to make it better.\u201dSam Lew, policy director of the Coalition on Homelessness, said the proposition was a \u201cno-brainer\u201d because the funding would provide housing.The measure qualified for the city ballot in July. Polling conducted by the opposition campaign in early September indicated that 56 percent of likely voters favored the tax, but that number decreased to 47 percent when they received opposition messaging.In August, an executive at Dolby Laboratories, which makes entertainment systems, sent an email to more than 30 technology companies in San Francisco about the measure, asking if they planned to take a stand on it. Other companies on the email included Salesforce, Stripe, Twitter, GitHub, Uber, Lyft, Zendesk, Slack and Yelp.Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, who favors the measure, said in an interview: \u201cYou are either for the homeless or you\u2019re not.\u201dExecutives at Salesforce and Stripe said they would most likely oppose the measure, according to the emails, which were obtained by The New York Times.In one email, Darryl Yee, Salesforce\u2019s tax chief, said: \u201cI grew up in SF and very much want to address the homeless problem, but the city\u2019s budget already seems pretty healthy, especially when you consider we\u2019re only a population of 800K.\u201dMichael Yip, Stripe\u2019s head of tax, wrote back that tech companies might make sizable charitable donations to homelessness causes instead, \u201cin hopes that this will be enough to sway the Mayor to publicly oppose this.\u201dTwitter and Zendesk declined to comment. GitHub and Lyft did not return requests for comment. Yelp said it was \u201cnot active\u201d on the issue.Patrick Collison, Stripe\u2019s chief executive, later tweeted that the measure was \u201cpoor policy.\u201dIn a statement on Friday, Stripe said that homelessness was complex and that \u201csolutions require careful interventions.\u201d It added, \u201cAnyone who claims that Prop C is a matter of being \u2018for the homeless or against them\u2019 is selling a facile falsehood.\u201dMr. Benioff said early conversations within Salesforce focused on opposing the tax since \u201call companies are supposed to oppose all taxes. You kind of learn that in business school.\u201d But he changed his mind after talking with his co-chief executive, Keith Block, who often encountered homeless people on his walks to work.\u201cWe said, you know what, I think we have to support this,\u201d Mr. Benioff said. He added that homelessness \u2014 not taxes \u2014 had become an existential threat to business in the city and that Salesforce might have to leave if the crisis continued.On Oct. 8, Mr. Benioff announced his $2 million commitment to passing the measure and tweeted his support for the tax.In response, Mr. Dorsey tweeted his opposition. Mr. Benioff then questioned Mr. Dorsey\u2019s philanthropy; Mr. Dorsey insisted that Mr. Benioff reread his arguments.Mr. Dorsey now plans to give $75,000 to the campaign against the tax, a Square spokesman said. The funding would help spread a more nuanced message about the ballot initiative, Mr. Dorsey said.Stripe has also recently donated an additional $400,000 to the campaign against the tax, according to public records. Michael Moritz, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital, gave $100,000, according to public records. In an email, Mr. Moritz said he agreed with Stripe\u2019s stance on the measure and noted that his foundation had recently given $11 million to Hamilton Families, an organization fighting homelessness.Cisco\u2019s chief executive, Chuck Robbins, spoke in support of Mr. Benioff in a statement this week, saying, \u201cWe must end the homelessness and housing crises our communities are facing.\u201d He said he was supporting a proposition to fund affordable housing in San Jose, Calif., where Cisco has its headquarters.In a phone call after their Twitter exchange, Mr. Benioff said, Mr. Dorsey told him that the tax in Proposition C was too high. Mr. Dorsey said he had merely pointed out the disproportionate impact that the tax would have on payment processors like Square. Mr. Benioff estimated Salesforce would pay $10 million annually for the tax; Mr. Dorsey said Square, a much smaller company, would pay $20 million.Mr. Benioff has since continued taking digs at other San Francisco tech leaders and their stance on Proposition C. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know they didn\u2019t like it until they realized I supported it,\u201d he said.Mr. Dorsey, when asked if he agreed with Mr. Benioff\u2019s characterization of their conversation, responded with a single word: \u201cNo.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Biggest Buyers of American Stocks Are on the Sidelines Right Now", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerican companies are the largest source of demand for American stocks, and sharp tumbles have come when their buying slows. Another element worth considering? The biggest buyers probably aren\u2019t buying. It may seem counterintuitive, but the largest single source of demand for American stocks is the American companies that issue them. Companies are on track to repurchase more than $770 billion in their own stock this year, according to research from Goldman Sachs. That\u2019s more than twice the size of the next largest source of demand, exchange-traded funds, which last year bought $347 billion in shares. But those companies are getting ready to report earnings, an event that is preceded by a regular slowdown in buyback activity. Some large market dips in the past year have coincided with these quarterly slowdowns. Keith Parker, head of United States equity research at UBS Investment Research, said the market has been weaker when buybacks have slowed. \u201cWhen that dries up or slows significantly, you\u2019re having outsized market effects,\u201d he said. When companies have more cash than they believe they can use productively, they typically return it to shareholders either with cash payments \u2014 known as dividends \u2014 or by repurchasing shares in the market. Buybacks raise demand, putting upward pressure on share prices.Such repurchases have boomed this year as the strong economy \u2014 and steep cuts in corporate tax rates \u2014 have left American companies flush with profits. Companies including Apple, Cisco Systems and Amgen have returned billions in cash to shareholders by buying back shares. Apple is responsible for the largest sum, spending nearly $64 billion on buybacks in the 12 months ending in June 2018, the last period for which full data is available, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.But corporate buybacks regularly slow around the start of the earnings reporting season, because companies want to avoid any potential legal risks from buying stock ahead of publishing their financial results. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out there buying stock if you know good news is about to come out and the market doesn\u2019t know it,\u201d said Charles Elson, a professor of finance and corporate governance at the University of Delaware. This year, periods of reduced buyback activity have, at times, been accompanied by sharp sell-offs in stock markets. Around the time when buybacks dried up in late January, according to UBS data, the S.&P. 500 suffered an ugly drop, falling more than 10 percent from a record high. The market stabilized alongside corporate buying in early February. Likewise, a buyback slowdown in April was accompanied by a tumble in stocks. The stock market\u2019s capricious behavior cannot be traced to a single factor, of course. But a slowdown in buybacks effectively removes a lot of motivated buyers from the American exchanges, which might have been a stabilizing force.\u201cNo one else buys back share proportionately anything like the U.S.,\u201d said Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a uniquely U.S. phenomenon.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Emmet Flood, his impeachment lawyer, and Mick Mulvaney, his chief of staff, and Bill Shine, the supposed Great Communicator, were on the yellow sofas, while Ivanka and Melania faced him in the armchairs. Pence sat against the wall, trying to look as harmless as a mouse.\u201cThe pardons are on top?\u201d\u201cThose first,\u201d said Flood.He signed with the usual flourish. But halfway, a name stopped him. He tossed open the next four folders, then shoved all five off the desk, several pages of parchment flying free as the leather covers bounced on the rug.\u201cNo flippers. I told you. Cohen. Flynn. Stone. Gates. Manafort. They all talked tough then sat up for Mueller like little dogs. Not to mention the House impeachment hearings.\u201d\u201cMr. President,\u201d said Shine. \u201cYour statement will say you\u2019re issuing pardons so the nation can put the investigation behind it. That\u2019s why you\u2019re including family members. But if that\u2019s the reason, you can\u2019t leave out the cooperators.\u201d\u201cDon is never doing a day in jail. I\u2019ve said that since Mueller filed the charges. And I\u2019m sure as hell not pardoning those gutless bastards, if I can\u2019t pardon myself.\u201dFlood\u2019s lips rolled into his mouth briefly.\u201cSir, the Constitution says expressly that the president can be indicted after impeachment, which would make no sense if the president could pardon himself. That\u2019s why Nixon didn\u2019t do it.\u201d He held up a hand, smiling fleetly at Pence. \u201cBut I have faith that a pardon will come in good time.\u201d\u201cEmmet,\u201d he answered, \u201cwhat kind of idiot makes a deal with nothing in writing?\u201d\u201cSir, that wouldn\u2019t be wise for the vice president.\u201dMulvaney and Pence\u2019s chief of staff had done some kind of fan dance. Nothing out loud. The pardon would come right after the 2020 election. But no sooner. Ford had lost after he pardoned Nixon.Still frowning, he opened the last folder.\u201cAnd what does this say exactly?\u201d The letter to Speaker Schiff and the Senate president pro tempore, Charles Grassley, was only a few lines, but he\u2019d tried to avoid reading since he was a kid.Flood answered. \u201cIt says you are invoking Section 3 of the 25th Amendment, because you can no longer carry out the duties of the presidency.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the lunatic section, right? That\u2019s not the cabinet and the vice president saying I\u2019ve lost it?\u201d\u201cThat would be Section 4. Section 3 is voluntary. Your letter says your doctors now find a grave risk of heart attack or stroke if you continue in office.\u201d\u201cHeart, right. We\u2019re saying I have a bad heart.\u201dShine said, \u201cThat\u2019s what the Democrats have been saying for years.\u201d The room rocked with laughter, until they saw his expression.Ivanka quickly raised a tempering hand.\u201cThe beauty, Dad,\u201d she said, \u201cis that the impeachment stops. Legally \u2014 and because the Democrats would be virtually attempting murder.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m still president, right?\u201dEmmet said, \u201cMike\u2019s title will be acting president.\u201d\u201cAnd any time I change my mind, I just write a letter.\u201d\u201cYou could. If Mike and the cabinet disagreed, Congress would vote. But that\u2019s not our plan.\u201dHe reached again for the pen. Then it hit him.\u201cBut I can play golf, right?\u201dFor a second, they all looked to one another. Finally, Mulvaney said, \u201cRight. You\u2019re not so sick that you can\u2019t relax.\u201d\u201cAnd I live here. In the White House?\u201d Melania grimaced, but everyone else turned to Pence.\u201cOf course, Mr. President,\u201d the V.P. said. \u201cUntil the very last day of your term.\u201dHe mushed up his mouth while he pondered, his chin in the air. Then he shook his head. No.\u201cI\u2019ll beat this in the Senate, just like Clinton.\u201d\u201cMr. President,\u201d said Mulvaney, \u201cThere are 22 Republican Senate seats up next year. Not all of them are eager to defend voting to keep you in office. A Senate acquittal is not guaranteed. And you\u2019ll hand the Senate to the Democrats in the process, maybe with a filibuster-proof majority.\u201dFlood jumped in. \u201cAnd an impeachment trial will not serve you well. The Democratic managers will force you to testify or plead the Fifth in public. And we\u2019ve resisted the House subpoenas for your financial records, but Chief Justice Roberts will order those documents produced. The Russian transactions will create a very bad impression. After that, if you\u2019re pardoned, New York State is almost certain to indict you for money laundering.\u201dHe waited, then shook his heavy face solemnly again. For a long moment, no one spoke. Then Ivanka said quietly, \u201cDad, we\u2019ll lose next November.\u201dHe\u2019d endured all this pretty calmly, but now he felt anger, his constant companion, flushing through him.\u201cThat\u2019s crap,\u201d he said.\u201cDad, your polls have never recovered from the Mueller report.\u201d\u201cThe polls said I\u2019d lose last time. The only way the D\u2019s win is if the Deep State rigs it. My people will riot.\u201d\u201cDad, the market is down. The tariffs and the deficit are slowing the economy. Kasich is ahead of you in New Hampshire. And Rubio will jump in, if Kasich wins. The party will tear itself apart. But if you sign this, Mike runs. He\u2019s soothing. He\u2019ll win. Otherwise, 15 months from now, a Democrat will be sitting in your chair, reversing everything you\u2019ve accomplished, with a new A.G. investigating your pardon.\u201dHe didn\u2019t answer.\u201cAnd worst of all, Dad,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019ll call you a loser. For the rest of your life, wherever we go, there will be crowds chanting, \u2018Loser.\u2019 The historians will say it.\u201dHe let his eyes meet hers. She meant it.\u201cBut this way,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen Mike wins, you win. You\u2019re the winner.\u201dBy Zo\u00eb SharpThe Russian landed at Dulles after 48 hours of traveling. Of necessity, he came from Moscow by a circuitous route. A long way with a very specific task. There would be no return flight.In the airport bars, the TVs were tuned to different news channels but the story was the same. First the president\u2019s campaign manager, then his lawyer, a Republican congressman, former aides, family members. Those who weren\u2019t indicted were subpoenaed. House arrest had become fashionable.The Town Car sent by the hotel had a flat-screen for his entertainment on the 45-minute drive into D.C. The channel once snidely referred to as \u201cstate TV\u201d now delighted in showing long shots through the White House railings of men in uniforms removing boxes of incriminating paperwork. The president himself was not in residence. He was holed up on home ground.The walk across the hotel lobby included a brush with a businessman intent on his cellphone. The Russian did not touch the inside pocket of his coat, into which his new identity had been adroitly slipped, until he reached the desk and produced it.The clerk was slow to respond. His attention was on the TV in the bar.\u201cThey\u2019re saying the Russkies put him up to it,\u201d the clerk said, handing over his room key. \u201cAnd I voted for the guy!\u201dThe Russian shrugged. \u201cFake news. \u2026\u201dBut the clerk did not look believing.He spent a day in his suite, watching the slow grind toward impeachment.Around 11 p.m., his contact arrived. The man had been in deep cover for decades. In his briefcase was a bottle of Stolichnaya and a 9-millimeter Makarov semiautomatic pistol.\u201cThere is no other way?\u201d It was intended as a statement. It emerged as a question.They drank vodka until the early hours. The contact left for the airport. The Russian drank on alone. Throughout his career, he would have spent these hours going over the plan, the escape route. This time, there was no escape route \u2014 only honor. And death.At 7 a.m., he showered. The bar of soap had the hotel name stamped into both sides. He made sure to wash his ass with it. Then he shaved and ate a last room-service breakfast. He dressed in the porter\u2019s uniform that had been obtained for him, tucking the Makarov into the back of his waistband.When it was time, he went downstairs, took his place in the lobby before the entourage appeared. The hotel staff had been lined up to see their boss, the president, go by. A few of them applauded. Most did not.The president didn\u2019t seem to notice. He waved, in his desultory fashion. The Secret Service agents clustered around him, ushered him toward the armored limo idling outside at the curb.The Russian waited until they were a few steps past before he drew the gun. He sighted on the center of the president\u2019s back, and squeezed the trigger.The Makarov misfired.The Secret Service agent at the president\u2019s shoulder heard the click, spun into a crouch. He registered the scene instantly, drawing his own weapon with razor-edge reflexes.The Russian tasted failure. He closed his eyes and waited to pay the cost.It did not come.He opened his eyes. The Secret Service agent stood before him, presenting his Glock, butt first.\u201cHere,\u201d the agent said politely. \u201cUse mine. \u2026\u201d Moscow, November 2018. The Kremlin. A visibly agitated National Security Council is briefing the president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin. The atmosphere at the table is one of barely controlled Slavic rage.Bortnikov of the F.S.B. interrupted. \u201cThese American cyberattacks have had wide-ranging effects: The high-speed Moscow Sapsan train was inexplicably signaled to stop by its onboard computer halfway to St. Petersburg, in the middle of the forest near Bologoye. The train would not respond to repeated computer commands to move. A dozen passengers descended from the train, intending to continue the journey by bus. Several of them are still missing in the snow.\u201dAlexey Likhachev of Rosatom spoke into his microphone. \u201cTrain signals along other rail lines are likewise unresponsive. Our entire rail system is locked up. How could this happen?\u201d President Putin glared down the table. He saw fear in the room.Bortnikov continued. \u201cThere\u2019s more. There apparently were early-morning, unauthorized news broadcasts from state-run Moscow 24 television. Engineers claim the transmission computers were hacked by an unknown foreign source in Scandinavia \u2014 without doubt the Americans \u2014 which was impossible to block or jam. These rogue broadcasts lasted two hours and were seen by an estimated 100,000 viewers. The programs covered recent food riots in Nizhny Novgorod and Kazan as well as a biopic about dissident punk band Pussy Riot starring the American actress Reese Witherspoon. Coming attractions for future broadcasts advertised a program entitled \u2018The Treasures of Putin\u2019s Black Sea Palace\u2019 narrated by Washington celebrity lawyer Lanny Davis.\u201dPresident Putin looked around the table before speaking. \u201cThese sensitive subjects are unacceptable and must be kept from the public. All intelligence organs must ensure that Russian television stations are immune to outside interference.\u201dPutin looked up. Butina was a personal favorite of his. \u201cThe Americans still hold her?\u201d Naryshkin nodded. \u201cTell her to be patient,\u201d said Putin. \u201cShe will be home soon enough.\u201d\u201cAnd the other operations?\u201d said Naryshkin.Putin stood up and headed for the door to his private office. He turned and pointed at his chief spook.\u201cContinue the phishing operation to penetrate the firewalls of The New York Times. Continue to collect the I.P. addresses, logins and passwords of Mueller\u2019s entire staff and hack into their servers. We shall soon see whether the Americans have the stomach for a second Cold War.\u201dThe room remained quiet while the president disappeared behind the door.By Laura LippmanI didn\u2019t watch it right away, but no more than three days went by before I plugged it into my computer. It is less salacious than you might imagine, more conventional sex than out-and-out deviancy. That\u2019s why I have downplayed it as a smoking gun that proves collusion. There is clearly something amiss with his hair. We glimpse a patch of skin at one point; it reminded me of that scene in \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d when we see Darth Vader\u2019s scalp. Not bald, but the hair is sparse, the skin pink and damaged looking. I think there might be plastic surgery scars. Is he vain enough to kill anyone who sees this? It\u2019s not a rhetorical question.What little audio there is \u2014 aside from heavy breathing \u2014 is innocuous. He mocks the room, saying only a \u201cterrible, no-class president who doesn\u2019t know from luxury\u201d would settle for such accommodations. He tells the women: \u201cMy hotels are so much better, they\u2019re the best, they\u2019re beautiful, come to the United States, I\u2019ll show you what real luxury is.\u201d Not a grave insult, but grave enough, apparently. The tape, as I tried to signal in an interview earlier this year, does not prove collusion, only the possibility of collusion. So why did someone send it to me? That\u2019s the question I asked myself, but it was the wrong question.And as much as Trump tried to tank it, he simply couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s how incompetent he is, how little he understands about the voters whose hatred he courted and stoked, the so-called deplorables whom he secretly considers losers. The joke was on the United States. Russia chose our president and they chose a fool. Because he made fun of a room at the Moscow Ritz-Carlton.My F.S.B. lawyer dropped by the other day, his conversation terrifyingly bland. He reminded me I have asylum until 2020. He asked after Lindsay, when she might visit again.Then, as he was taking his leave, almost as an afterthought. \u201cYou realize the promise that you wouldn\u2019t face the death penalty, or additional charges that carry the death penalty \u2014 that was Mr. Holder\u2019s pledge. The current Justice Department has made no such promises.\u201dWas that a threat? Would someone actually put me to death because I have this tape? Is Putin testing me, trying to find out how deep my patriotism goes? Could I save my country from this man? Isn\u2019t it consistent for me to protect the 45th president\u2019s privacy as I have tried to help others protect their privacy?I guess I have until 2020 to think about these things.By Joseph FinderThe president was in the White House residence, attending to his hair. This took a good half an hour, what with the Just for Men color (Sandy Blond, he\u2019d finally settled on), the rinse, the blow dryer, the comb and the hair spray. Then pivoting that side hank of hair back over his bald center lane and twisting and flipping it a bit so it jutted out in front just right. He allowed no one else to do it. Hairdressers talked.On the 110-inch flat screen, which took up most of one wall, he watched the footage of yesterday\u2019s rally in Orlando, maybe the greatest political rally in history.He should be feeling good. Even the fake-news polls showed him 15 points ahead of Pocahontas. The White House would be his for another four-plus years. Way past time for some serious renovation.But his new press secretary was weak. The fake news media was obsessed with Russia, and his guy would never punch back like Sarah used to. Maybe it was time to replace him.He remembered something Putin had told him in Helsinki, about how he\u2019d fired his chief of staff, Ivanov. He\u2019d said to the guy: \u201cSergei Borisovich, have you done the job I asked you to do? No? Well, God gives, and God takes away.\u201dThe impeachment of 2019 had been a big nothing. The House held its hearings, and the Mueller report was a best seller \u2014 because all books about him were. But the Senate held firm. End of story. And they weren\u2019t going to impeach him again.The phone trilled sharply, startling him out of his musing. It was his executive assistant, Madeleine. Something about a meeting in the Situation Room. It was urgent.\u2666\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d he said, sinking into his chair at the head of the mahogany table in the Sit Room.Sitting alongside his senior cabinet members were all these anonymous gray-faced types his chief of staff kept saddling him with. Under secretaries and deputy directors \u2014 they had that Deep State smell of old tea bags.\u201cSir, another Russian dossier is circulating in intelligence channels,\u201d Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director, said. \u201cThe ultimate source has to be someone high up. Kremlin-level. The details check out.\u201dTrump groaned. \u201cDetails. About what?\u201d\u201cAbout, uh, money laundering.\u201dTrump\u2019s face grew warm. \u201cI can always pardon myself.\u201d\u201cNot in New York State.\u201d Haspel exchanged glances with his White House counsel and slid a blue folder across the table. \u201cThis is a sample.\u201dTrump opened it and saw columns of figures and bank account numbers. His eyes crossed. He had no patience for spreadsheets.\u201cIt\u2019s a detailed list of transactions between the Trump Organization and three sanctioned Russian oligarchs,\u201d Haspel said. \u201cOffshore bank accounts and wire transfers, names, dates, everything.\u201dTrump looked up. \u201cFake news,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, no one cares about this stuff. It\u2019s too complicated.\u201d He looked around the table. Everyone was avoiding his eyes.\u201cCoats?\u201d Trump said. His director of national intelligence had always seemed reliable.In a small voice, a pained expression on his face, Coats said, \u201cSir, I\u2019m afraid this is unsurvivable.\u201d\u2666The red secure phone was already sitting on the Resolute desk in the Oval Office. He\u2019d had them change the gray Cisco IP phone to a red model, which looked more appropriate.\u201cYou have a rat in the Kremlin,\u201d he told Putin, without bothering to say hello. \u201cHe leaked a bunch of documents about my business interests. You need to track him down and shoot him in Red Square.\u201dPutin didn\u2019t even wait for the translation. He laughed. He didn\u2019t laugh often. \u201cSorry, but this is not possible,\u201d he said, in heavily accented English.\u201cWhy not?\u201dPutin switched back to Russian. The translation came quickly. \u201cDonald, have you done the job I asked you to do? You didn\u2019t get rid of the sanctions. Instead, your Congress has piled up more and more of them. You\u2019re paralyzed politically. The relationship between our two countries has been poisoned, and it gets worse all the time. I say, time to start over.\u201dThere was a long silence on the line.The line went dead.Advertisement"}

He received at least $60.7 million in loans, many never repaid.\u2022 Fred Trump grossly undervalued properties that he passed onto his children, dodging hundreds of millions in gift taxes.\u2022 The Trumps created a company that inflated the value of equipment purchased for their housing units and passed the difference onto the Trump children. One tax expert said that might have constituted criminal tax fraud.A lawyer for Mr. Trump has threatened to sue the NYT.Its Model 3 output nearly doubled, into the 50,000-to-55,000 range that Mr. Musk had predicted. The carmaker delivered 83,500 vehicles to customers, 55,840 of which were Model 3s, about three times as many as in the second quarter.In previous quarters, the company\u2019s costs increased as it made more cars, wiping out any chance at getting into the black. Tesla is expected to report its third-quarter earnings later this month. David Whiston, an analyst at Morningstar, said that Tesla could report a profit for the quarter but that he was not convinced that it would. \u201cThey\u2019re making more cars,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard to say if they are making money on every one.\u201dFacebook Connect, which lets users log into other apps with their Facebook accounts, was supposed to be a digital passport to the rest of the internet. Now it could be a big headache.Those stolen credentials could have been used to gain access to so many other sites. Companies that allow customers to log in with Facebook Connect are scrambling to figure out whether their own user accounts have been compromised. The hack and its fallout underscore the lengths to which Facebook has cemented itself as the identity of the internet, and what happens when the security systems of one company \u2014 trusted by so many \u2014 fail.The American economy is enjoying an unusual but sustainable period of low unemployment and low inflation, according to the Fed chairman \u2014 and it could continue.He said the Fed\u2019s success in holding down inflation in recent decades has reinforced public expectations that inflation would stay low, and that, in turn, is helping to keep inflation low. \u201cThese developments amount to a better world for households and businesses, which no longer experience or even fear the scourge of high and volatile inflation,\u201d Mr. Powell said on Tuesday in Boston at the annual meeting of the National Association for Business Economics.It may mean that major investors believe in crypto, despite the industry\u2019s challenges. (Bitcoin is trading at about $6,478, 67 percent below its December 2017 peak, and other digital currencies are trading at lows as well.)Coinbase has suffered from that plunge, according to Recode. But its executives argue that the company remains a technology platform that can ride out the waxing and waning of crypto prices.
