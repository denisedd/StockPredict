{"Headline": "Hurricane Michael\u2019s Deadly Strike Leaves Florida Panhandle Reeling", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO BEACH, Fla. \u2014 The scope of the devastation brought by Hurricane Michael came into sobering focus on Thursday as rescue workers searched a ruined landscape of splintered homes, toppled trees and upended vehicles that stretched across much of the Florida Panhandle.The seaside community of Mexico Beach, where the storm made landfall, was a flattened wreck. Across the small sportfishing town, piers and docks were destroyed, fishing boats were piled crazily on shore and townspeople wandered the streets in horror and wonder.\u201cThese were all block and stucco houses \u2014 gone,\u201d said Tom Bailey, the former mayor. \u201cThe mother of all bombs doesn\u2019t do any more damage than this.\u201dAnd while Mexico Beach was the hardest hit, much of the Florida Panhandle was a landscape of collapsed buildings and compromised roads and water systems. Rescue teams evacuated hospitals, searched rubble for survivors and dropped emergency supplies from helicopters.[Follow our live updates on the aftermath of Hurricane Michael here]The storm\u2019s rage spread across six states, and well more than a million homes and businesses were without electricity on Thursday as Michael made its way seaward as a tropical storm. At least 11 people were confirmed dead, and officials appeared resigned that the toll would rise. Local governments imposed dusk-to-dawn curfews and told residents to boil their water. The American Red Cross said about 7,800 people slept in shelters on Wednesday night.\u201cSo many lives have been changed forever, so many families have lost everything,\u201d said Gov. Rick Scott of Florida. \u201cHomes are gone, businesses are gone. Roads and infrastructure along the storm\u2019s path have been destroyed. This hurricane was an absolute monster.\u201dTo go from town to town on Thursday, and even battered block to battered block, was to see how Michael could be as capricious as it was destructive. In St. James, Fla., newer homes stood intact next to older ones that had been shattered into piles of soggy wood. Even some of the homes that had survived \u2014 barely \u2014 had their insides spilled onto the sand: refrigerators, seat cushions, life vests.Beyond lives and homes, the storm seized community hubs, like two oak trees long used as a place to gather and talk in Greensboro, a small town in Gadsden County, Fla. By the end of the storm, they had crashed to earth.One of four dead in Gadsden County was a man from Greensboro who had a heart attack on Thursday morning. Rescuers, faced with a mess of debris, could not immediately reach him, but neighbors and others rushed in with chain saws and tractors, pulling away tree limbs to clear a path.\u201cThis town got destroyed within 24 hours, but it took us 12 hours to bounce back harder than ever,\u201d said Jay Stiles, a local firefighter. \u201cCitizens came together.\u201dReaching Greensboro at all was difficult because Interstate 10 was closed in several locations, blocked by debris. Travel across the Panhandle was arduous everywhere.In Carrabelle, on the coast, even two National Guard trucks had to turn around when they came upon a hurricane-strewn barricade of fallen trees and broken buildings. Just before that impasse, which made communities like Apalachicola and Eastpoint inaccessible from one direction, the storm had cratered a road as if an earthquake had struck, too.Across from a pungent paper plant in Springfield, Michael Williams, 70, stood shirtless in his yard with a sign that read \u201cHELP. Anything. Food. Water.\u201dMr. Williams, who is on disability, said he thought the storm would come and go quickly, so he had not stocked up on supplies for himself, an 8-year old boy and an autistic woman for whom he is caring. A tangle of fallen trees had blocked his truck. He was stuck, he said, and desperate. Someone had given him some cans of ravioli, and he said he had made a campfire to warm it outside.As for the sign, he said, \u201cI used to see people in the road do this and now I understand why they do.\u201dThe storm\u2019s effects reached deep into the Panhandle. In the town of Marianna, more than 60 miles northeast of Panama City, roofs were torn off buildings, pine trees had snapped, and piles of bricks and debris were strewn across downtown streets.\u201cAll the power lines are down, and there are trees everywhere,\u201d said Leroy E. Wilson, Jr., who was driving from his home outside Marianna to Dothan, Ala. \u201cThis is the worst storm we\u2019ve ever had in this area. It was very, very bad.\u201dDavid Bishop, who drove into town Thursday to check on his parents, said that chain saws were \u201cthe hot commodity here.\u201dFlorida suffered the greatest destruction, but there was also widespread damage in Georgia, parts of which Michael struck after it weakened to a Category 3 hurricane, with winds of at least 111 miles per hour.Although Georgia\u2019s southwest is sparsely populated, state officials reported at least one fatality, an 11-year-old girl whose home was hit by a flying carport, and said the storm had devastated the farmland that powers rural Georgia\u2019s economy.\u201cOur worst dreams are being realized,\u201d said Gary W. Black, the state agriculture commissioner, who said he had seen pictures of cotton that a farmer harvested on Wednesday, before the hurricane tore through Georgia.\u201cThis morning, you cannot tell where he stopped harvest, and where the rest of it was harvested by the storm,\u201d Mr. Black said.President Trump, speaking at the White House about the widening devastation across the South, said the nation had not \u201cseen destruction like that in a long time.\u201d\u201cThe big problem with this hurricane was the tremendous power,\u201d he said, \u201cand, fortunately, it was very fast.\u201dThe storm\u2019s track took it mostly away from the eastern parts of the Carolinas, which had been devastated just a month ago by Hurricane Florence. Major river flooding was not expected, though the winds were high and listing trees were watched warily, given the already saturated soils.In Florida, the road to Mexico Beach became passable Thursday morning, less than 24 hours after Michael made landfall, and it became evident that few communities had suffered more. Known for its sport fishing, the city of about 2,000 permanent residents swells to as many as 14,000 in July, and is known for having a relaxed, small-town feel compared to the brash tourist strips of Panama City Beach or the tony nearby beach developments of Alys Beach or Seaside.But this week, after winds that reached 155 miles per hour, much of the town was in ruins. There were few locals to be found, and fewer tourists.Mr. Bailey, the former mayor, and his wife had ridden out the storm underneath his home in a bunker of sorts that he built. The home itself was left largely roofless and uninhabitable. On Thursday, he was riding around on a bicycle, trying to put the pieces back together in his mind.\u201cIt\u2019s just absolutely stupid and ridiculous what I\u2019m seeing,\u201d he said. \u201cHouses that have been here forever are gone.\u201dOfficials were not allowing visitors to drive into town because the roads were barely passable, but convoys of military trucks and Humvees were moving in, while hard-hatted search-and-rescue crews went door to door \u2014 although often there were no doors \u2014 to search for survivors and bodies.In the late morning, two men from the New Orleans Fire Department could be seen searching the second story of a raised home, the face of which had been sheared off by the wind. From the ground level, the rescue workers looked like dolls in a dollhouse.They eventually descended, axes in hand, and spray-painted an \u201cX\u201d symbol well-known to New Orleanians after the horror of Hurricane Katrina. The firefighter wrote in paint the name of the search crew, the date the place was searched and the number of bodies inside. In this case, the firefighter painted a big zero.Then it was a trudge on to the next house. They took care not to even enter homes that were leaning sideways. There was no gas or electricity. Misfiring house alarms chirped incessantly like electric cicadas.The New Orleans rescue crew said they had not found any bodies as of lunchtime Thursday, but such searches take time. Rescue teams generally grid out areas that they are assigned to search, and crews walk block to block, announcing their presence with shouts to see if anyone responds from the rubble. To save time, the rescuers do not approach every house and instead look for signs that someone might have stayed home during the storm \u2014 a car in a driveway, a running generator \u2014 and decide whether to come closer.The few locals sticking around said they knew that this was the first phase of a recovery that would take years.Nate Odum, 53, an owner of the badly-damaged local marina, said that some people might have been spooked enough to leave for good. But he was confident that Mexico Beach would come back. If it was cursed with being in a hurricane zone, it was also blessed.There were many wealthy fishermen in the Southeast, he said, and they would be lured back here so long as there were dolphin, wahoo, and blackfin tuna to be caught.\u201cWe\u2019re the front porch to some of the best fishing in the Gulf,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to take it day by day.\u201dRichard Fausset reported from Mexico Beach, and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.

{"Headline": "Where in the World Is Denmark\u2019s $2 Billion?", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs large as it is, the building would be easy to miss. Plain, gray and near a McDonald\u2019s, it\u2019s part of a generic office complex surrounded by a vast parking lot in a suburb of Copenhagen. \u201cDanish Tax Agency\u201d is stenciled in both English and Danish on a glass front door.This outpost of SKAT, as the I.R.S. in Denmark is known, seems an improbable setting for what the authorities call one of the great financial crimes in the country\u2019s history. For three years, starting in 2012, so much money gushed from an office here that it was as though the state had sprung a gigantic leak.Prosecutors in Copenhagen say it was an elaborate ruse, one that ultimately cost taxpayers more than $2 billion \u2014 a spectacular sum for Denmark, the equivalent of a $110 billion loss in the far larger American economy.The country had fallen victim to a dubious financial maneuver at the intersection of the tax system and capital markets, a dizzyingly complex transaction known as a \u201ccum-ex\u201d trade.The trade is focused on one of the dullest, most overlooked acts in any financial system \u2014 the request for refunds on taxes withheld on dividends. Under Danish law, the government automatically collects taxes on dividends paid out by companies to their shareholders. If the shareholders live in the United States, they are eligible for a refund on some or all of those taxes.A tiny department in SKAT, run by one man, approved thousands of applications for refunds. Most of the applications were filed by self-directed pension plans in the United States, a type of retirement account for individuals.But experts and lawyers familiar with the scheme say those people were fronts for cum-ex trades. Deploying a kind of financial sleight of hand, the trades made it appear as if the pension plans had purchased shares of Danish companies and paid taxes on the dividends. Neither was true.To the Danes, it was a fraud, one executed and conceived by Sanjay Shah, a 48-year-old, London-born financier. With an assist from employees, he found the Americans, helped facilitate the applications and ended up with much of the money.Mr. Shah denies any wrongdoing and through a publicist says he merely took advantage of a loophole. He now lives in Dubai, where he owns a $1.3 million yacht and a 10,000-square-foot villa with access to the beach. He has become Denmark\u2019s national villain.\u201cYou have this guy, living off fraud, it\u2019s infuriating,\u201d said Joachim B. Olsen, a member of the Danish Parliament and chairman of its Finance Committee. \u201cThe expectation of the Danish people is that we will go after him, no matter the cost.\u201dWhat has made the dividend debacle even more painful is that many here believe it was an inside job. The lone employee approving those tax refunds was a lifelong civil servant named Sven Nielsen. After a lengthy investigation, the police learned that Mr. Nielsen had spent a few boozy and convivial evenings with an employee of Mr. Shah\u2019s, although they found no evidence that he had colluded or profited in any way.Instead, they discovered evidence that years ago, Mr. Nielsen had helped an old friend bilk SKAT in a relatively small scam. Through his lawyer, Mr. Nielsen declined to comment \u2014 from prison, where he is now serving a six-year sentence for criminal fraud in that case.So, Danes are left with a mystery that belongs in a Nordic noir, one with elements of farce and filled with enraging twists. Is Mr. Nielsen a co-conspirator, or a dupe? Is he a criminal or a man so flattered by attention that his critical faculties abandoned him?The other mystery concerns Mr. Shah, who is now rebranding himself as a philanthropist, raising money for autism research by promoting concerts with performers like Flo Rida and Lenny Kravitz. He has been formally termed a suspect by Danish authorities, but to the collective amazement of the Danes no criminal charges have been filed against him.A spokesman for the State Prosecutor for Serious Economic and International Crime would not say why. Instead, with impeccable Scandinavian restraint he said only that the case involves people \u201cwho seem to have used a very crafty setup.\u201dIn each, he sits in a spacious living room in a house in Dubai and muses about his life and business philosophy, omitting any hint of controversy. He comes across as an upbeat, middle-aged expat with an abiding fondness for music. After a midlife crisis, he founded Autism Rocks and became a part-time concert promoter, at one point booking his personal favorite, Prince. Mr. Shah also has a taste for the extravagant. In one video, he said that sports cars parked outside the office at Merrill Lynch, where he worked early on, inspired him to consider a new career.Mr. Shah was raised in London by parents of Indian ancestry who had immigrated from Kenya. He dropped out of college in 1992, citing a lack of motivation, and worked at a number of large financial firms. In 2007, he landed a job at the London office of Rabobank, a Dutch company, on the dividend arbitrage desk.There he learned about cum-ex trades. The term is Latin for \u201cwith-without\u201d and refers to the status of shares before and after a dividend is issued. Cum-ex trades would quickly become the focus of Mr. Shah\u2019s professional life.As economies around the globe reeled, Mr. Shah found himself in one of the few growth segments in banking. Cum-ex trades are made possible by tax treaties between countries, agreements that are intended to prevent double taxation. Denmark has such a treaty with the United States.Traders made off with more than $11 billion, according to officials there. Cum-ex would reap fortunes from the governments in Austria, Belgium and Switzerland, too.It took years for the German authorities, who banned the practice in 2012, to figure out what had hit them. The first cum-ex indictments in the country were filed in May.\u201cIt turned out to be one of the biggest financial scandals that Europe has ever seen,\u201d said Bastian Finkel, a tax lawyer at BLD, a law firm in Cologne, \u201cand all the more painful because it\u2019s public money.\u201dIn the wake of their losses, the authorities in Germany didn\u2019t bother to alert other countries, and speculators moved elsewhere. The biggest target, it turned out, was Denmark.Under the terms of an American-Danish tax agreement, Americans who own shares in, for instance, Carlsberg can get a full or partial refund on the 27 percent withheld for tax on dividends. Retirement accounts get the best deal of all. They get all 27 percent of the tax back.To scale up his cum-ex trade, Mr. Shah needed individuals in the United States with self-directed pension plans, a type of retirement account that allows owners to invest in a wide range of financial instruments. By 2012, he had found more than a dozen of them \u2014 which turned out to be plenty.The names of these Americans who owned the self-directed pension plans became public this summer, when Danish authorities sued them, hoping to recover lost funds. Exactly how these people linked up with Solo Capital is unknown. Mr. Shah\u2019s publicist would say only that they came via wealth management advisory firms.There are demographic patterns. Most live on the East Coast, with clusters in New York, New Jersey and Florida. At least five different plans used the same mailing address, 425 West 23rd Street, Apartment 7B, New York, N.Y. The current tenant there had never heard of the Danish lawsuits, but said he had received mail for one of the defendants, Gavin Crescenzo, a previous occupant.Nearly all the defendants have jobs in finance, though one, Michael Ben-Jacob, is a partner at a prestigious law firm, Arnold & Porter. He declined to discuss the case and a spokeswoman at the firm said it did not comment on litigation in progress.Many people have their names attached to dozens of pension plans, which is why there are 277 suits and roughly 17 defendants. A 30-year-old named Roger Lehman, for instance, opened 44 plans in a handful of states, with names such as the Ludlow Holdings 401K Plan and the Hotel Fromance Pension Plan.Mr. Shah said through his spokesman that Solo Capital worked with 200 of these pension plans. He declined to identify which ones.None of the defendants responded to requests for comment. In July, though, an email response came instead, unbidden, from a law firm in Luxembourg called Schaffelhuber M\u00fcller & Kollegen. A partner there named Helene Schwiering stated that her clients, whom she did not name, would appreciate it \u201cif you henceforth refrain from attempting to contact them.\u201dOn paper, the owners of the plans pocketed most of SKAT\u2019s $2 billion. In reality, these people probably wound up with little or none of the money.That, at least, is the impression of John Hanamirian, a plaintiffs attorney in New Jersey. Until mid-July, he represented defendants in more than 50 cases, then he suddenly filed legal papers withdrawing from all but a few of them.The withdrawal filings were revealing. They stated that Mr. Hanamirian was not paid by defendants named in the lawsuits. Rather, his bills were paid by what he described only as a \u201cLuxembourg law firm.\u201d And that law firm would not provide needed files about his defendants, \u201cdespite repeated requests,\u201d he wrote.In an interview, Mr. Hanamirian elaborated. The firm was the one in Luxembourg that sent that out-of-the-blue email asking that defendants in the cases be left alone.\u201cI needed documents surrounding their involvement, whatever that is \u2014 bank statements, investment statements, communications,\u201d Mr. Hanamirian said. \u201cThe firm wouldn\u2019t do it. They said, \u2018We\u2019ll meet you in advance, the day of the proceedings.\u2019 I said that\u2019s unacceptable.\u201dBefore exiting the cases, Mr. Hanamirian spoke to a handful of clients who told him that money went in and then was immediately moved out of their accounts. Whether the defendants earned a fee of some kind is unknown to Mr. Hanamirian, as is the ultimate destination of the funds.\u201cI don\u2019t want any of this to reflect on my former clients,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the whole thing was definitely odd.\u201dIn 2013, all that stood between Solo Capital and Denmark\u2019s treasury was the bespectacled, gray-haired veteran of SKAT, Sven Nielsen. After two colleagues retired, he was the last person in the Dividend Department. Complicating matters, he lacked the tools to perform the most basic due diligence when reviewing refund applications.The agency was in the midst of a yearslong and often disastrous overhaul, meant to digitize the system and reduce head count. The priority was helping Danish taxpayers, not foreign shareholders. Mr. Nielsen didn\u2019t even have a database to check whether an individual pension plan actually owned the shares it claimed, said Lisbeth Romer, who was Mr. Nielsen\u2019s boss until she retired in 2013.\u201cSven\u2019s job was reduced to bookkeeping, essentially, checking if a form was filled out properly,\u201d she said. \u201cA monkey could do it.\u201dThere was another problem that nobody knew about then: Mr. Nielsen could be persuaded to break the law. When the Danish police searched his home after the Solo Capital revelations, they found a letter showing that in 2007, he helped an old friend illegally secure $5.7 million from SKAT. (The two men knew each other from the days when Mr. Nielsen moonlighted with a job delivering newspapers.) Last December, prosecutors convicted Mr. Nielsen of fraud for taking a kickback, the equivalent of $315,000, for his efforts.Defenders of Mr. Nielsen maintain that he is a fundamentally decent guy who made a serious mistake under the suasion of a pal. True or not, Mr. Nielsen had a new pal in 2014, just as the SKAT payouts soared.His name was Camilo Vargas. He worked in London at one of a small number of \u201cpayment agents,\u201d niche companies that handle the array of paperwork submitted to foreign tax authorities for refunds. Mr. Vargas had just founded his own payment agent firm, which he called Syntax GIS. Soon after Syntax began operations, it started working with Sanjay Shah, who eventually bought the company.During the first of several trips to Copenhagen, Mr. Vargas sought out Mr. Nielsen, asking for guidance on how to fill out Danish tax refund applications. What is known about those meetings comes from the one interview Mr. Nielsen has ever given, in a 2016 documentary that ran on DR, Denmark\u2019s version of the BBC. Mr. Nielsen appeared to be flattered by the attention and happy to provide advice.He just as gladly accepted invitations to dinner. Mr. Nielsen described in the interview a lively evening drinking beer with Mr. Vargas in a popular downtown area in Copenhagen.\u201cWe walked down Stroget,\u201d he said, referring to a famous pedestrian street, \u201cand made several pit stops.\u201dThe friendship was fantastically lucrative. In 2014, more than $590 million was paid on 1,500 refund applications. Danish authorities believe most of them came from Solo Capital clients. In the first seven months of 2015, the figures soared to roughly $1.2 billion, paid to more than 2,500 applications \u2014 about 16 applications every working day.It apparently never occurred to Mr. Nielsen that Camilo Vargas was playing him.\u201cAt no point did I get the impression that he wanted to trick me or cheat in any way,\u201d Mr. Nielsen said in the documentary, sounding bereft. \u201cBut that\u2019s what it could appear like today.\u201dMr. Vargas could not be located for comment. The producers at DR hired a researcher to find him, to no avail.In the summer of 2015, the pace of applications made one final surge. In July alone, $500 million in refunds was disbursed \u2014 about $25 million per working day, $3 million every hour.Mr. Shah may have had a hunch that the Danish tax refund machine was about to stop working. In May 2015, he met in London with his then-new compliance officer at Solo Capital, Navin Khokhrai. As Mr. Shah put it in the handwritten letter provided by his publicist, Mr. Khokhrai expressed profound reservations about Solo Capital\u2019s business, telling his boss that he was unsure \u201cwhether the company was processing the trades correctly.\u201d Mr. Shah assured him that he\u2019d obtained all necessary legal clearances.Mr. Khokhrai was apparently not convinced. He resigned soon after and Mr. Shah stated in the same handwritten letter that his former employee \u201csubmitted a whistle-blower letter to HMRC\u201d \u2014 Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue and Customs \u2014 \u201calleging that Solo had created fictitious client accounts and trading records in order to defraud the tax authorities in Denmark and Belgium.\u201dIn August 2015, the dividends stopped flowing out of SKAT, though not because of sirens set off by anyone inside the agency. Rather, it took a tip from the British government to end the scheme, several Danish politicians said. The London offices of Solo Capital were later raided by Britain\u2019s National Crime Agency and by July 2016 Solo Capital closed.At the time, Mr. Shah said he had done nothing improper. \u201cHad they accused a large bank like Goldman Sachs the bank would have kicked back with a large team of lawyers,\u201d he told Borsen, a Danish newspaper. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to target a single individual.\u201dDanish authorities have been trying to unravel Mr. Shah\u2019s handiwork for over three years. Much of his modus operandi was revealed, experts believe, in 2017 when police in Germany, who were acting at the behest of the Danes, used a search warrant to sift through the records of North Channel Bank, a small bank in Mainz, a city outside Frankfurt. A team of 60 investigators found that the bank was used by 27 of the American pension plans, which were ultimately paid a total of about $168 million by SKAT.What investigators found is that the accounts didn\u2019t actually own any shares of Danish companies, said Prof. Christoph Spengel, who served as an adviser to Germany\u2019s Parliament during an inquiry into the questionable trades. He studied the results of the North Channel investigation, issued in a report by a German district attorney. He said that the 27 plans primarily traded with one another. One would place an order to short a chunk of shares of Danish stock \u2014 essentially, a promise to buy the shares once they dipped below a certain price.Soon after, an order was placed by another of the 27 plans to buy the order for the shorted shares. That open buy order \u2014 essentially, a promise to purchase shares that the other plan still didn\u2019t own \u2014 was proof enough for SKAT to approve a refund. Once the refund was issued, the buy order was canceled.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a transaction, this wasn\u2019t tax planning,\u201d Professor Spengel said. \u201cThis was fraud.\u201dA spokeswoman for North Channel said the bank was cooperating with the authorities and had no comment.After funds were wired to North Bank, Professor Spengel said, they were shunted to two banks, first in London, then another in Germany. Finally, he said, they were sent to accounts controlled by Mr. Shah and his wife, Usha.Jack Irvine, Mr. Shah\u2019s spokesman, said none of this was true.\u201cNeither Solo nor Sanjay have had anything to do with North Channel Bank,\u201d he wrote in an email, \u201cso there appears to be confusion, which is not unusual in this case.\u201dThere has been outrage in Denmark over the SKAT scandal but so far the repercussions have been surprisingly limited. No ministers have been fired. The director of SKAT was laid off in August 2016, though Mr. Shah\u2019s machinations were among several causes. A new investigation into the cum-ex disaster was ordered by the justice minister in February, which could last years. For now, politicians here seem to emphasize pragmatism over finger-pointing.\u201cIn the past, governments have fallen because of investigations like this,\u201d said Jesper Petersen, a member of the opposition Social Democratic Party. \u201cBut we have yet to find any minister who saw evidence of this problem and ignored it.\u201dSanjay Shah is preoccupied with his own troubles. In mid-September, a High Court of Justice judge in London entered a $1.3 billion default judgment against Solo Capital and a company it owned, Elysium Global, in a case filed by SKAT alleging fraud. Mr. Shah\u2019s spokesman said his client didn\u2019t respond to the lawsuit because both companies are now controlled by liquidators.He also said that at the prodding of Danish officials, Britain, Germany and the United Arab Emirates have all frozen, though not confiscated, $660 million in assets belonging to Mr. Shah. The financial pinch is enough that Mr. Shah has been forced to put his house up for sale, the publicist added. Out of caution, the publicist said, Mr. Shah does not travel.Fears of arrest and extradition are justified, said Henning Sorensen, an associate law professor at the University of Southern Denmark.\u201cShah is free as long as he stays in Dubai,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is like a bird living in a golden cage.\u201dAn earlier version of the article included a picture that misidentified the person shown. It was Thomas G. Svaneborg, not Sven Nielsen, a Danish civil servant who was being interviewed by Mr. Svaneborg in a documentary that was the source of the picture.An earlier version of this article misstated the place where Lenny Kravitz performed a concert. It was in London, not Dubai.Alain Delaqu\u00e9ri\u00e8re and Martin Selsoe Sorensen contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Push to Invest in the Arts Grows Stronger", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWealth MattersOne of Lorrie Meyercord\u2019s investments will be La MaMa, a theatrical organization and performance space with more than 50 years of work in the East Village.Like an out-of-town tryout for a Broadway musical, Lorrie Meyercord tested her desire to make an investment in the creative economy by choosing a small city before moving to New York.She invested $1 million in artist housing in Dearborn, Mich., in 2016 through a nonprofit group called Artspace, which builds and manages affordable residences for artists and art organizations. The venture was a success because it gave the arts community broader social support while also providing Ms. Meyercord with a safe investment.The concept is known as impact investing, in which investors consider social good in addition to financial returns. It was also a path to expand the way people think about investing in the arts, an area often overlooked by investors.Two years later, Ms. Meyercord is making a similar investment, but this time, she is focused on the thriving New York art scene.The organization is receiving a $3.2 million line of credit that will help pay to renovate its main theater.\u201cSo many people are looking at the bottom line and not understanding how this loan affects our local economy,\u201d said Mia Yoo, artistic director of La MaMa, noting the group employs 45 people but give opportunities to about 1,500 artists a year.\u201cLa MaMa is dealing with experimental work and trying things for the first time,\u201d she said. \u201cThe impact of it, we don\u2019t see for years.\u201dShe pointed to Julie Taymor, who produced early works at La MaMa in the 1980s, long before winning a Tony for directing the musical \u201cThe Lion King\u201d in 1997.Impact investing has matured in the past decade. There is now an abundance of projects in clean water, education and low-income housing, but growth in arts investing has been slow.\u201cThe arts by their nature are intangible, and so their results are intangible,\u201d said Evan Beard, national art services executive at U.S. Trust, a private bank for high net-worth individuals. \u201cThere are metrics to say how many people got clean water or how many were cured of malaria. The metrics on this are challenging.\u201dSince Upstart Co-Lab was founded in 2015, it has helped increase interest in impact investing in the arts because \u201cwe learned how to talk about this and frame it,\u201d said Laura Callanan, a founding partner.\u201cTalking about what\u2019s in and what\u2019s out of the creative economy makes a lot of sense,\u201d Ms. Callanan added. She has also been able to point to the success of the Artspace investments.The investment was structured like a revolving line of credit, which has been drawn from again several times. Artspace was able to use the money to fund a similar project in Memphis.The success has attracted more interest. Ms. Meyercord\u2019s $1 million investment in the first project accounted for 40 percent of the $2.5 million that went to Artspace.Both then and now, Upstart teamed up with organizations that are known for their socially responsible investing: first with the Calvert Foundation, a mutual fund that organized the investment in Artspace, and this time with the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, a lender known as LISC that underwrote the bond.The New York investment is focused on the blue-collar workers in the arts community, particularly as manufacturing jobs in the city shrink.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the financial expectations and whether they\u2019re a good bet as a borrower but also their impact on the neighborhood,\u201d Ms. Callanan said. \u201cThe whole point is that these are jobs people can do across a lifetime.\u201dFor recipients, the money often comes at a crucial time.\u201cWhen Artspace goes out to do a project, predevelopment funding is impossible to raise money for,\u201d said Kathleen Kvern, president of national advancement at Artspace.\u201cThis allows us to start work and go raise money later,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s enabled us to start these projects when we didn\u2019t have a predevelopment contract.\u201dShe said the group envisioned recycling a five-year line of credit several more times, which differs from grants, which are given for a specific project. The downside, though: \u201cThese are loans,\u201d Ms. Kvern said, and they have to be paid back. And because Artspace is building permanent, affordable housing, the loans are going to be paid back not with a windfall but with consistent rents and fund-raising.Some advisers argue, though, that impact investing in the creative economy could remain a hard sell compared with more common recipients of such funding like education and health care.And traditional art funding \u2014 through philanthropy and private buyers \u2014 has worked well, Mr. Beard said.\u201cDoes our art system need impact investing?\u201d he said. \u201cWe already have this very dynamic art model that goes out in the world. That may be why we\u2019ve seen a failure to launch with impact investing in the arts.\u201dBut groups like Upstart Co-Lab and LISC are looking to invest in a broadly defined creative economy, which can include traditional arts organizations like La MaMa but also small manufacturing companies that make high-end cabinetry and retail displays.\u201cWe\u2019re providing an opportunity to invest in arts culture and creativity,\u201d said Sam Marks, executive director of the New York office of LISC. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to create a new channel of investment capital. This is about benefits for low- and moderate-income people.\u201dThat channel is not necessarily a risky one, but it\u2019s also not a lucrative one, either. The eight-year note on the New York project, which pays annual interest of 2.75 percent, is backed by LISC, which has an investment-grade rating.Katherine Fulton, an independent philanthropic consultant in Northern California, said she was looking for impact investments in the arts but felt limited. Most of the savings that she and her wife, Katharine Kunst, an artist, have are managed by a large brokerage firm that does not have impact offerings.Until they made a $100,000 investment in the New York project, they felt there were not a lot of options for affluent investors.\u201cWe needed to find something that was easy to do,\u201d Ms. Fulton said. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe return. It\u2019s not a high return. But it\u2019s also important because cities and urban spaces need the creative economy.\u201dOf course, just labeling a deal as an impact investment in the arts does not make it a great investment. Ms. Meyercord said she toured a site in upstate New York that was aiming to revitalize a former manufacturing town with a film production facility.\u201cIt was really cool, but there wasn\u2019t a clear-cut way to get involved,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t live in New York, and I wasn\u2019t going to come in and spearhead the whole thing.\u201dThe investments in New York and Dearborn were essentially in real estate, which in turn will be used in some form by artists. It\u2019s easy to grasp how an investor will be repaid.Ms. Meyercord estimated that six of her 25 impact investments were in the arts. She said she was happy with the investments she had made so far, but wished there were more people looking for deals with her.\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been more difficult than I thought,\u201d she said. \u201cI would like to find more people like myself who are sourcing these projects and I can collaborate with. I haven\u2019t necessarily found other investors who make this a top priority.\u201dThere is a silver lining: \u201cOther investors think it\u2019s interesting, and they\u2019re happy to get on board. There just needs to be someone to do the legwork.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Suburban Women Turn to Democrats, Many Suburban Men Stand With Trump", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUBLIN, Ohio \u2014 Robert Peters and George Fidelibus walked off the 18th green at the Golf Club of Dublin, then carried pints of beer to the patio overlooking the course, which was framed by $500,000 homes.Their conversation quickly turned to the president.\u201cI\u2019m feeling better and better about him all the time,\u201d said Mr. Peters, 63, a retired engineer, who had once been cool to Mr. Trump.Mr. Fidelibus, 75, a retired banker in a Calloway hat, had also once been skeptical of the president\u2019s bullying and lack of self-control.\u201cI\u2019m a supporter of Trump now,\u201d he said \u201cHe may not always say things the way most presidents before him said them, but what does it matter? They didn\u2019t get the job done.\u201dAs an edgy, divided nation heads into a crucial election, much of the attention is focused on the anti-Trump animus of suburban women, which seems to have gained a few degrees in intensity over the Supreme Court confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh.Much less examined are their male counterparts. While recent polls show that white women with a college degree favor Democratic House candidates by a large margin, 20 points or more, white college-educated men \u2014 who focus more singularly on economic issues, according to surveys \u2014 are a potential bulwark for the president and his party. It is especially true in suburban battleground districts that are likely to help decide the next House majority.White men without a college degree were Mr. Trump\u2019s most reliable supporters, but they made up only 33 percent of his total vote. College-educated white men were also essential to putting him over the top.These men, largely Trump voters whose support for him has solidified since his election, are business owners and sales executives, veterinarians and lawyers \u2014 men who largely wouldn\u2019t be caught dead at a Trump rally chanting \u201cLock her up!\u201dThey may cringe at a president who humiliates cabinet secretaries and foreign allies, and who utters a stream of easily disproved falsehoods.But many have quietly struck a bargain with Mr. Trump: They will overlook his trampling of presidential norms because he is delivering just what they want on the economy, deregulation, immigration and foreign affairs.\u201cHe\u2019s tough, he\u2019s a bully, but boy things are getting done,\u201d said JD Kaplan, who runs a graphics business from his home on a neatly landscaped block in Dublin, an affluent suburb of Columbus. Mr. Kaplan, 63, who is a Republican activist, moved years ago from northeast Ohio\u2019s struggling Rust Belt, where a younger brother still runs Kaplan Furniture, a store their grandfather founded.\u201cWhether it was Obama who started it or not, the economy\u2019s better,\u201d he said. \u201cI see my brother\u2019s businesses are doing better, my graphics business is doing better, my wife\u2019s got a better job.\u2019\u2019Mr. Balderson is on the ballot again on Nov. 6 against the same Democratic opponent, Danny O\u2019Connor. The race has dropped out of the national spotlight it held during the summer, but the same dynamics are at work: whether Mr. O\u2019Connor, an official in Franklin County, which includes most of Dublin, can attract enough votes in the suburbs to offset rural conservatives who favor Mr. Balderson.Here, as elsewhere around the country, the vote has become largely a referendum on the president.Interviews in August and on a recent return visit showed that while Mr. Trump is losing droves of white women with college degrees, many of their male counterparts now strongly support him.They are country-club Republicans who long voted for business-friendly politicians like Gov. John Kasich, who represented the 12th District in the House and is the national face of never-Trump Republicans.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.One Dublin man who is a former Ohio assistant attorney general, and who now owns a manufacturing business, said he wrote in Mr. Kasich\u2019s name in 2016, rather than cast a ballot for Mr. Trump. \u201cBut now I\u2019m a big supporter,\u201d he said of the president.He asked to be identified only by his first name, Sam, because he fears a backlash for his business if he publicly supports the president.\u201cI feel he\u2019s done a marvelous job,\u201d he said.He added: \u201cI can\u2019t stand his personality and behavior.\u201dOther men who back Mr. Trump in Dublin were also unwilling to let their full names be used. They did not want to inflame clients, colleagues or family members.\u201cBehind closed doors there\u2019s very, very solid support,\u201d for Mr. Trump, said Charles McClenaghan, a lawyer, who is president of the Dublin Republican Club.\u201cI think that\u2019s exactly why the polls got it wrong in 2016,\u201d he continued. \u201cPeople felt intimidated, they felt bullied. They\u2019re just not going to talk politics. But when they get in the voting booth, they\u2019re going to look at the wonderful success he\u2019s had.\u201dThe college educated men said they sifted a wide variety of news sources, from MSNBC to USA Today to Breitbart, and formed their own opinions on Mr. Trump. Somehow, though, their views usually seemed to confirm their partisan predispositions.Like other Republican-held battleground seats that analysts say will help determine the next House majority, the 12th District is whiter, richer and better educated than the nation as a whole.Its voters differ fundamentally from Mr. Trump\u2019s winning coalition in 2016, which was anchored by white voters without a college degree, primarily in the Midwest.White college men, on the other hand, are up for grabs. They split exactly 49 to 49 percent in their party preference in the Washington Post poll. The Monmouth survey showed them favoring Republicans by six points.Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth Poll, said there were major differences in the issues that animate white college-educated men and women.\u201cThe normal set of political concerns for men are which party is going to give me lower taxes and less regulation,\u201d Mr. Murray said. \u201cWhereas white college-educated women are saying, \u2018I will do fine economically, but I am really worried about the tone of the Trump presidency, I\u2019m worried about the direction this country is going.\u2019\u201dDublin, a growing city of 47,000, is the quintessence of the suburban good life: 75 percent of adults graduated from college; the median household income is $125,500.Its most famous entrepreneur, Jack Nicklaus, is immortalized in bronze alongside a boulevard entering Muirfield Village, a luxury golf and home development he created in the 1970s.On a recent Saturday afternoon, a Muirfield resident, Rick Vanover, took in the Ohio State football game at the Bogey Bar and Grill. \u201cHow do I feel about Trump? I\u2019ll tell you,\u201d he said. He punched up an app and held his phone to display the digits 26,447, the Dow\u2019s closing the day before: once again near record territory. After the market\u2019s 4 percent slide this week, he said his support had not lessened.\u201cI\u2019m a conservative with common sense,\u201d said Mr. Vanover, a sales executive for a Fortune 100 company.The next day at the Golf Club of Dublin, two other players finished their games, a veterinarian and a medical physicist, and sauntered into the Tudor-style clubhouse, where they ordered chicken wings and beers.The golfing buddies were on opposite sides of the nation\u2019s roiling political gulf, but had managed to remain friends. \u201cCan I try one of these?\u201d the veterinarian said, reaching for the physicist\u2019s plate of Buffalo wings.Paul Lundahl, the physicist, who works in cancer treatment, said he had long been apolitical, \u201creluctantly\u201d voting in 2016 for Hillary Clinton while not caring much about the outcome.\u201cI\u2019ve never really considered myself a Republican or Democrat or whatever,\u201d he said.But he has grown to detest Mr. Trump.\u201cI just cannot believe what comes out of that guy\u2019s mouth every time he speaks,\u201d Mr. Lundahl said. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m on the playground as a second-grader.\u201dThe veterinarian, who would only be identified by his first name, Steve, was a fan of Mr. Trump\u2019s.He praised the Republican tax cut because it put more money in his clients\u2019 pockets, which has meant more of them come to his clinic for heartworm and flea treatments for their pets.\u201cThat helps me,\u201d the veterinarian said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t really care what the president says. He\u2019s a crude guy. It\u2019s embarrassing. But what he\u2019s done is what he said he was going to do.\u201dHe credited Mr. Trump for getting Justice Kavanaugh confirmed and for meeting with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un. \u201cHow many people over the past 50 years between Obama and Clinton and Bush failed?\u201d the veterinarian said. \u201cWho made the deals? Trump did.\u201dMr. Lundahl has become so numb to the president\u2019s trampling of political norms, he said, that he recently decided not to talk anymore about Mr. Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s so exhausting,\u201d he said.There was a commotion on the TV above the bar. \u201cDid the Steelers tie the game?\u201d the veterinarian said. \u201cHow\u2019d they do that?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "No, Trump\u2019s Tax Cut Isn\u2019t Paying for Itself (at Least Not Yet)", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisFederal revenues rose slightly in the 2018 fiscal year. But that doesn\u2019t mean the $1.5 trillion tax cut is bringing in more revenue than it\u2019s losing.Some conservatives don\u2019t see the rising deficit numbers that way. They note that the Treasury reported that federal revenues rose by 0.4 percent from the 2017 fiscal year to the 2018 fiscal year, and view that as a sign that the tax cuts are \u201cpaying for themselves,\u201d as Republicans and Mr. Trump promised.That\u2019s not the case.There are several ways to ask the question, \u201cAre tax cuts paying for themselves?\u201d Based on the data we have right now, they all arrive at the same answer: \u201cNo.\u201dThe issue here is not whether the government spends too much money, or whether tax cuts have buttressed economic growth, or even whether it\u2019s advisable to run such high deficits in flush economic times. The issue instead is: Have the corporate and individual tax cuts that went into effect in January generated so much additional growth that tax revenues are as high, or higher, today than they would have been if the tax cuts never passed? That\u2019s how all scorekeepers \u2014 be they independent congressional staff members or researchers from think tanks that lean liberal or conservative \u2014 assess the \u201cpay for themselves\u201d question. One way to think about it is from the perspective of a small-business owner. Let\u2019s say you run your own bakery. You sell bread for $4 a loaf. Today, you sold 90 loaves, for $360 in revenue. You expect that, because it\u2019s a busier day at the bakery tomorrow, you\u2019ll sell 100 loaves then, earning $400. But you\u2019d like to sell even more than that, so you lower the price to $3 a loaf to encourage additional purchases.Congratulations! You sell 125 loaves. Your revenue goes up, to $375. That\u2019s more than you brought in the day before. Your price cut, though, has not \u201cpaid for itself\u201d \u2014 because you ended up bringing in less revenue than you would have otherwise. In other words, you brought in more money than the day before. But it\u2019s less than you would have made if you hadn\u2019t cut the price.That\u2019s the equivalent of selling more loaves, but earning less money. By the Treasury\u2019s numbers, total revenues grew 0.4 percent from the 2017 fiscal year to the 2018 fiscal year. That\u2019s weak, historically speaking, for an economy growing as fast as it is; in the 2015 fiscal year, when growth was comparable to what it is today, revenues grew 7.5 percent from the previous year. But revenue is definitely growing after the tax cuts, right?Well, no. That overall drop looks worse when you consider inflation. A dollar today buys about 2 percent less than it did a year ago, according to the inflation index used by the Federal Reserve to set monetary policy. So the government brought in slightly less money year over year, and that money was worth less than the equivalent amount a year ago, which means it buys fewer meals for troops, materials for highway construction or any of the other goods and services that tax dollars go toward. Republicans dismissed those warnings. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he expected the new law to more than pay for itself \u2014 it would help to reduce future deficits. It\u2019s possible that optimism could turn out to be right, but only if the tax cuts unleash a sustained boom in productivity and economic growth, and with them, much higher revenues than we saw this past fiscal year. In other words, we\u2019re going to need to make \u2014 and sell \u2014 a lot more loaves. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "On Wall Street, the Bond Market Sets the Tone", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe rise in yields is a double-edged sword. It reflects optimism about the economy, but also gives traders reasons to worry.The bond market dominated the conversation on Wall Street this week as yields on benchmark Treasury bonds, which help determine interest rates for borrowers ranging from first-time home buyers to international corporations, steadily rose to seven-year highs.But as rates rise, borrowing will also become more expensive for consumers and companies, potentially slowing growth. Higher rates also change the balance of risk and reward for investors in other markets. Reflecting this, stocks fell, with the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ending the week down more than 1 percent. The idea that growth will push interest rates higher, only for higher rates to slow things down again, reflects the cyclical nature of the economy. Right now, rates are somewhere in between \u2014 not high enough to hurt growth, but rising and making some investors wary as they do. Here\u2019s what to make of it all.The economyGovernment bonds are known as safe haven investments. People buy them, instead of riskier investments like stocks, corporate debt and commodities, because they\u2019re worried about something: the economy, war, politics, you name it. Bond yields move in the opposite direction of prices, so yields fall during such rough patches. Since the financial crisis hit a decade ago, yields have been pretty low. The yield on the 10-year note has spent much of the past decade below 3 percent. (The low point was under 1.4 percent in July 2016.) Those yields prevailed even as the American economy recovered. That\u2019s partly because the Federal Reserve took extraordinary steps to try to nurse the economy back to health. But it also reflected lingering doubts among investors about the expansion. Even recently, plenty of investors have doubted whether the economy could grow as a trade war erupted.But grow it has, with gross domestic product expanding at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in the second quarter, and even some glass-half-empty types are becoming convinced that a recession isn\u2019t in the cards any time soon. So yields are rising. \u201cBig picture, the economy is very strong,\u201d said Tim High, an interest rate strategist at BNP Paribas in New York. \u201cThe employment market remains very strong.\u201dIn fact, the worry has now switched to whether that growth will start to run too hot, leading to faster inflation and pushing the Fed to raise interest rates faster than it would like. For now, High said, that isn\u2019t something to worry about \u2014 which means investors should be spared any nasty economic surprises. The FutureIn the United States, we rely on a lot of debt to fuel the economy. And when the cost of that debt rises, it can drag on growth. We\u2019re about to find out how heavy that weight will be. As we\u2019ve said, for much of the last decade, long-term interest rates \u2014 which are essentially set by the Treasury market \u2014 have been quite low. Now rising rates are pulling other key borrowing costs higher. Rates on conventional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are above 4.7 percent, the highest level since 2011. Likewise, interest rates on 48-month new car loans have risen to more than 5 percent. They hadn\u2019t been that high since 2012, according to the most recent data from the Fed. Traditionally, cars and houses play a big role in the consumption-driven American economy. And if there\u2019s a weak spot in the otherwise strong economy, it could be in these interest-sensitive sectors. Sales of existing homes have slipped in recent months. They were flat in August, and are down 1.5 percent from the previous year. Automakers have reported steep declines in sales in September. Part of that decline reflected hurricanes that caused flooding in the Carolinas. But higher interest rates and rising car prices are also pushing some buyers toward the used car market. The Stock MarketWe often talk about financial markets \u2014 stocks, corporate debt, government bonds, commodities \u2014 as if they existed in complete isolation from one another. They don\u2019t.Changes in one can often have large effects on another. If oil prices fall, for example, that\u2019s obviously going to pinch the earnings of the companies that pump oil and refine gasoline. That will affect the stock prices of those companies, and the stock market as a whole.Likewise, higher yields on government bonds can have a subtle, but important, impact on the stock market. As rates move higher, they can persuade more and more people who\u2019ve ridden the nearly decade-long bull market in stocks to take some of their winnings off the table and sock them away in government bonds.Eventually, that could start to take the wind out of the stock market\u2019s sails.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fixing the Climate Requires More Than Technology", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMajor transformations can happen in a generation. But not without government help.Drs. Oreskes and Conway are historians of science and the authors of \u201cThe Collapse of Western Civilization \u2014 A View from the Future.\u201d Last week\u2019s report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was bad news from top to bottom. Dangerous planetary warming is underway, it\u2019s happening faster than scientists predicted, and time is running out to stop it.What does this mean for us? Right now, government is widely seen as inefficient and ineffective, and our needs are thought to be best addressed by the private sector, through entrepreneurship, venture capital and Silicon Valley-style \u201cdisruption.\u201d But unless we acknowledge the need for a substantial government role, we are going to be stuck, because change driven solely by the marketplace is unlikely to suffice.Some might object that our current challenge is vastly different from those met by past technological changes, because we\u2019re not just talking about a thing, like a radio or cellphone, but about changing our entire energy system. But these earlier transformations involved systems, too. Just as energy technology isn\u2019t one thing, neither were the railroads, radio, electricity or the internet. Those systems all involved many parts, including federal, state and local policies to support them (the land grants that made the railroads possible, for instance, or role of the Federal Trade Commission in licensing radio and television stations).What makes large-scale technological change challenging is the integration of all of those parts. Electricity wasn\u2019t just a matter of turbines, or even turbines, power lines and transformers. Financing and regulation were also required. After electricity was introduced to the urban marketplace, the biggest obstacle to its expanded use was profitability. The private sector was able to make money bringing electricity to densely populated cities like New York, St. Louis and Chicago, but it took federal intervention, under the 1936 Rural Electrification Act, to bring it to rural communities across America. And even then, uptake was not immediate. Rural electrification boosters insisted that hard-working farmers urgently needed electricity, but initial demand was less than expected. The Tennessee Valley Authority wanted to cut rates to drive up demand. But private utilities opposed this, worrying that low rates would threaten their financing, and the T.V.A. settled on an appliance subsidy to drive increased household consumption. Demand had to be built.The internet was created by scientists funded by the federal government\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency. Al Gore didn\u2019t build it, but he did sponsor the 1991 legislation that made it public, which laid the foundation for the World Wide Web, Silicon Valley, smartphones and our information-driven society.Demand for new technologies is rarely entirely spontaneous. If people have been living without something, it\u2019s not always obvious to them why they now need it. They are likely to resist being told that they must spend money or endure inconvenience to change. In most cases, demand has to be developed and nurtured. A case for change has to be made, supported by public policy. The fact that many of these technological revolutions took hold in a generation\u2019s time is partly because young people were quicker to adopt these new technologies than their elders. Some think that if we focus on technology, we can somehow avoid the messiness of politics and partisanship. But we won\u2019t get the energy technologies we need and the systems to make them work in the time we need them if we don\u2019t have the government policies to make them a reality.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Is Eastern Germany So Far Right?", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAlmost 30 years after reunification, the former Communist region is now home to right-wing extremism.Ms. Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel.A few weeks ago, a young man was stabbed to death at a city festival in Chemnitz, a city in eastern Germany; afterward two asylum seekers were arrested in connection with the attack. Large demonstrations broke out around the city, dominated at times by hundreds of right-wing extremists. Some raised their hands in the Hitler salute; journalists and counterdemonstrators were verbally and physically attacked; a mob threw stones at the owner of a Jewish restaurant. Similar demonstrations broke out in K\u00f6then, a town of 30,000 inhabitants in the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt. And on Monday, the police arrested seven men accused of planning attacks on politicians and foreigners on Wednesday.These events are not random. While violent crimes committed by right-wing extremists are down from 2016, they are still far more frequent in the five eastern German states than in the west, according to the annual report of Germany\u2019s interior secret service. And then, there are the polls. The eastern states of Brandenburg and Saxony will both hold elections next September. For both states, pollsters predict record results for the far-right populist Alternative for Germany party. East Germany was, of course, a Communist country; today it is a hotbed of far-right sympathy and outright hatred. What happened?The question angers Wolfgang Thierse, a Social Democrat and former president of the German Parliament, who was raised in the East. In the 1970s, he worked briefly for the Ministry of Culture in the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, but he was let go after refusing to support the expulsion of Wolf Biermann, a popular singer and critic of the Communist government. There is no such thing as \u201cthe East,\u201d Mr. Thierse told me. Eastern Germany, he says, is not one place, but a mix \u2014 areas of prosperity, creativity and economic innovation next door to areas of economic squalor and despair.Mr. Thierse\u2019s assessment is reflected in the government\u2019s annual \u201cReport on the State of the German Union,\u201d which was presented last week. While pensions and wages are rising and unemployment is down, the average income in the former East lags the former West by around 15 percent. The eastern economy sports some champion businesses, but has altogether fewer large companies, and lesser international investment. The eastern states have an older demographic, and a harder time finding qualified workers.The economic differences are just one piece in the puzzle of why the East seems so far to the right. Other explanations focus on the legacy of the political culture of the German Democratic Republic. Many across Germany felt like Chancellor Angela Merkel imposed her decision to accept a large number of refugees on the country \u2014 but eastern Germans, having lived under an authoritarian regime, reacted more strongly to decisions they feel they did not have a say in. Second, there are fewer migrants living in the east; people there lack the opportunity for everyday interactions with them, and thus harbor irrational fears of outsiders. Some also claim that eastern Germans, not having learned what democracy is like, are more easily frustrated with its tedious processes and often less-than-perfect results.Johannes Staemmler stresses a different point. Mr. Staemmler, born in the eastern city of Dresden in 1982, co-founded Third Generation East, a network of young professionals of eastern German descent. Today, he\u2019s a scientist and counselor working for a think tank in Potsdam, outside Berlin. He points out that many who joined the far-right protests in Chemnitz or vote for the Alternative for Germany are too young to have more than the faintest memories of the G.D.R. But they do remember the radical changes of the 1990s: privatization, the rapid death of East German industries and ensuing job losses.Mr. Thierse and Mr. Staemmler, both born in the East, are heard and respected by Germans on both sides of the geographic divide. Overall, however, the debate about what\u2019s happening in the east is dominated by western voices. Even 28 years after Germany\u2019s reunification, most prominent journalists are westerners, as are most prominent policymakers and business leaders.So when Germany discusses why the east is so far right, condescension almost inevitably sneaks in: For the sake of the argument, eastern Germany is unbuckled from the rest of the country, and the historical border is redrawn. In this new, old divide, eastern Germans are reduced to being subjects of analysis and policy proposals \u2014 never participants in the conversation. The east and west are still like unequal siblings. The strong one loves his smaller and uglier brother and accepts that his deviant behavior comes from trauma, but he still looks down on him. This subjugation of eastern Germans to mostly western German psychoanalysis is a political drama in itself. It seems like even in their most violent, most determined actions, eastern Germans can never be agents.\u201cYes, eastern Germans are on the couch,\u201d said Mr. Staemmler when I offered this interpretation. To him, however, the current public analysis is not necessarily disenfranchising. He says it could also become a moment of political empowerment. Suddenly people who haven\u2019t voted in decades are going to the ballot box. They may not vote for the party the rest of the country would like them to vote for. But at least they are politicized, and have the nation\u2019s attention. \u201cYou could also look at it this way: Whoever is on the couch has the chance to talk.\u201dWhichever way, it really is the moment to talk. It may mean talking to someone who is yelling at you, as Mr. Staemmler puts it. But it still is better to try it anyway, instead of letting eastern Germans sink back into scornful silence.Anna Sauerbrey is an editor on the opinion page of the newspaper Der Tagesspiegel and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile the casual Halloween reveler might cobble together a costume the morning of, cosplayers spend all year working on elaborate looks and getting into character.Some of us costume ourselves exactly once a year, on or around Oct. 31. But for cosplayers \u2014 people who dress up as a characters from movies, books, TV shows and video games \u2014 taking on other visual identities is a year-round lifestyle.The vast majority are hobbyists who spend anywhere from a few weeks to the greater part of a year working on outfits in advance of giant conventions (or \u201ccons\u201d). At these buffets of nerd events \u2014 panels and workshops with names like Synthetic Wig Styling and Polyamory in Sci-Fi \u2014 cosplayers get to show off their handiwork and mingle with kindred spirits, often late into the night.In cosplay, a good costume is as much about creativity with materials and construction as it is about the outcome. So while some people spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on custom outfits for cons, many more invest in time, using cheap materials and household items to transform themselves into characters of superhuman, mythical proportions.That ingenuity was on display at this year\u2019s Dragon*Con, held in Atlanta over Labor Day weekend, where some 85,000 people donned \u2014 or came to admire \u2014 elaborate, heavy creations of foam, metal and latex.In the mornings, in hotel rooms around the city, colorful transformations were taking place. I documented several before the cosplayers hit the streets.Materials:Sintra PVC foam core, EVA foamVelcroAdhesive: Contact cement, super glue Acrylic paint Dancer\u2019s leotard, black Knives: X-acto, beveled, multitool Red fabricSafety pins That \u201carmor\u201d includes a shoulder and chest plate, leg guards and a mask, all made from EVA foam (a material often found in workout mats or flip flops) and Sintra PVA foam core, which is surprisingly lightweight and, when painted gray, passes for brushed metal. Mr. Issac used X-acto and beveled knives to create convincing metallic angles in the foam. Mr. Issac, a graphic designer by trade, said he could really only stay in the costume for \u201cup to two or three hours\u201d on a hot day. But hours later, long after they had left the comfort of their air-conditioned hotel, he and Natasha were still going strong.\u201cMy love of cosplay keeps me young,\u201d Mr. Issac said. \u201cYou get older when you stop playing.\u201dMaterials:Fabric, largely sourced from scrap bins at Jo-Ann Fabrics Paint: Craft acrylic, textile and fabric paintSharpies (for quick fixes)Makeup: Contour pallette, lipstick, eye shadow, eye liner, an Elmer\u2019s glue stick Colored contactsEVA foamPlywoodVelcroCraft foamConverse sneakers from a thrift store Jennifer Wethington\u2019s artistry is driven by efficiency (\u201cI won\u2019t make something if I can\u2019t finish it in a month\u201d) and economy (\u201cIf I can\u2019t do it cheap, I can\u2019t do it\u201d). That she has become a minor internet celebrity for her costuming skills, with 30,000 followers on her Instagram account, is the result of many years of trial and error, she said.Gaige\u2019s gun, gearbox and wig were built from EVA foam, and decorated with acrylic and craft paints (and a Sharpie, which she keeps on hand to fill in faded spots). The design is meant to replicate the \u201ccel shading\u201d aesthetic of \u201cBorderlands 2\u201d \u2014 a graphic technique that is used in video games and 3-D renderings to give objects a hand-drawn look. Ms. Wethington applies the cel shading technique to her makeup as well, spending up to an hour hand drawing Gaige\u2019s bandages on her face, outlining her lips and eye brows with black lines, and matting her eye brows with an Elmer\u2019s glue stick. The end result makes her look like a hand drawn cartoon come to life. Cosmetics can run in heat, but it was the wig cap that Ms. Wethington worried most about in Atlanta (it can cause \u201cterrible\u201d headaches, she said). Her colored contacts, she said, also tend to \u201cdry out, then itch and reflect light off your eyes.\u201d Discomfort can be a small cost to pay for a great costume. For Ms. Wethington, the ability to \u201crun around and have fun\u201d in an outfit \u2014 and not be hindered by heavy, unwieldy materials \u2014 is always key. \u201cI just want to make a costume that I actually enjoy being in,\u201d she said.

Something was wrong, but she couldn\u2019t make any adjustments until the paint was completely dry. Well, she wasn\u2019t supposed to, but she did anyway, chastising herself the whole time. And then there was the issue of lip color. Ms. Kel layered Black Moon \u201cSorrow\u201d lipstick, a bold, metallic midnight blue, with a coat of Evil Queen liquid lip, a black shade with hints of blue and purple. But the effect wasn\u2019t what she had intended. Nevermind. After some experimentation, Ms. Kel decided it looked good enough, so she put on her wig, and tossed the shoulder-length, smoky blue tresses with a small flourish. Imperfections happen. Such is cosplay. Her face freshly painted, Ms. Kel knelt by her bed and used an intricate web of zip ties to attach the inner part of her gold shoulder toppers. The zip ties wouldn\u2019t cooperate, so every time Ms. Kel stood up, beaming, the gold shoulder topper just slid down her arm again. Her headpiece, however, presented the biggest liability. Crafted from cardboard and Worbla (a brand of thermoplastic that can be shaped when exposed to heat), Ms. Kel\u2019s creation had a wingspan that was almost four feet. She had to turn her head to walk out of the door. To complicate matters further, the headpiece quickly melted a line across Ms. Kel\u2019s face, which meant that once it was on, she couldn\u2019t really take it off. (Thankfully, Ms. Kel\u2019s golden scepter \u2014 a tension rod that Ms. Kel spray-painted gold, topped with a piece of craft foam wrapped in gold fabric \u2014 was ready for action.)Fully in costume, and only moments before leaving for the con, Ms. Kel hurt her knee \u2014 another set back. But her enthusiasm for cosplaying as Proxima Midnight wasn\u2019t bruised. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mike Pompeo and His Chinese Counterpart Trade Harsh Words", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 In unusually blunt language to an American secretary of state, China\u2019s foreign minister accused the United States on Monday of interfering in its internal affairs and of harming his nation\u2019s interests on the question of Taiwan.In a face-to-face exchange with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the foreign minister, Wang Yi, chided the Trump administration for \u201cceaselessly elevating\u201d trade tensions and \u201ccasting a shadow\u201d over relations between the two countries.Mr. Pompeo, who sat across the table from Mr. Wang at the start of talks in Beijing, said in a tart response that the United States had a \u201cfundamental disagreement\u201d on the issues that China raised.The sharp tit-for-tat stripped away the customary veneer of diplomatic niceties during public remarks. It came days after Washington laid down a tough new China policy announced by Vice President Mike Pence, who declared in a speech that the United States would \u201cnot stand down.\u201dMr. Pompeo arrived in Beijing after a trip to North Korea, South Korea and Japan that was largely focused on setting a time and place for a second summit meeting between President Trump and the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un. As he left Seoul, the South Korean capital, the secretary of state said he had made progress on arranging a meeting, which Mr. Trump wants before the midterm elections next month.Washington continues to seek China\u2019s help in smoothing the path to the denuclearization of the North, and that was part of the secretary\u2019s mission when he landed in Beijing.From the outset of his session with Mr. Wang, though, the deterioration of relations between Beijing and Washington in recent months took center stage.Mr. Wang complained that the United States was \u201cconstantly interfering in China\u2019s internal and external affairs\u201d but did not detail specific instances of that.Such language could refer to Washington\u2019s complaints about what it considers the Chinese government\u2019s unfair subsidies of major industries, particularly technology. It could also refer to the Pentagon\u2019s recent arms sale to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China considers its own. It was also probably a nod to the United States Navy\u2019s stepped up operations around islands that Beijing claims in the South China Sea.Mr. Pompeo\u2019s visit did not include a meeting with China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, apparently another signal of displeasure by the Chinese. The secretary of state met with Mr. Xi during his last visit to Beijing, in June.Last week, American officials said they were seeking meetings with the \u201cleadership,\u201d a phrase commonly used to refer to Mr. Xi. A notional schedule released during Mr. Pompeo\u2019s trip listed a meeting with him.But Chinese analysts said it would be highly unlikely for Mr. Xi to agree to see a cabinet-level American official, given the curdled relationship and Mr. Pence\u2019s forthright speech. Instead of Mr. Xi delivering a tough message, Yang Jiechi, the state councilor, would do so, Chinese analysts said.\u201cReceiving Pompeo in Beijing by anyone is itself a \u2018favor,\u2019 considering what the Trump administration has done to China since early July,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, professor of international relations at Renmin University in Beijing.At a briefing at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, its spokesman said the downturn in relations would not affect cooperation on North Korean issues. \u201cIn short, no,\u201d Lu Kang, the spokesman said when asked if there would be a negative effect.But cooperation on North Korea \u2014 one of the important issues on which the two sides have worked together \u2014 seemed increasingly unlikely. North Korea has not agreed to Washington\u2019s major request for the first step toward denuclearization: an inventory of all its nuclear assets. The North\u2019s adamance means this is an issue that China would not be able to assist with, analysts said.And while Washington wants to keep the pressure on North Korea\u2019s economy by enforcing strict United Nations sanctions, China now opposes that stance. At the United Nations last month, Mr. Wang, the foreign minister, proposed an easing of sanctions against the North, and China has begun to allow certain kinds of trade to flow across the countries\u2019 shared border.\u201cChina regards the lack of progress on the North as caused almost wholly by the Trump administration,\u201d Professor Shi said. \u201cSo China cannot and is not willing to help it in any substantial extent, even putting aside the rottenness of bilateral relations.\u201dOne of Mr. Pompeo\u2019s takeaways from his meetings in Pyongyang, the North\u2019s capital, was an accord to allow international inspectors to visit the nuclear test site at Punggye-ri. The North blew up the tunnels at the site in late May and inspectors would want to see whether the entire site was actually destroyed.China would be pleased to have its inspectors included in that verification process, said Cheng Xiaohe, a North Korea expert at Renmin University.Despite Mr. Wang\u2019s forceful words, China\u2019s state news media has gone out of its way to emphasize that Beijing should not appear to be the aggressor as the Trump administration unleashes its new hard-line policy.\u201cWe need to refrain from escalating friction with the U.S. and exaggerating the atmosphere of strategic confrontation,\u201d the usually strident newspaper Global Times said on Monday.At the same time, the paper struck a confident tone, saying the United States would not be able to challenge China the way it did the Soviet Union, by outspending on military weapons. A prominent international relations professor at Renmin University, Jin Canrong, was quoted as saying the American financial elite would refuse to forsake the Chinese market.\u201cU.S. allies like Europe and Japan have been largely silent,\u201d Professor Jin said in an interview published in the Global Times. \u201cA cold war needs two major blocs against each other, but the U.S. allies are not forming a bloc with it against China.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Beto O\u2019Rourke Attacks Ted Cruz as \u2018Dishonest\u2019 in Debate in Senate Race", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN ANTONIO \u2014 Representative Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, who has fallen behind Senator Ted Cruz in the polls in their hotly contested Senate race, turned sharply aggressive in their second debate on Tuesday night as he attacked Mr. Cruz\u2019s honesty and character while the two clashed over abortion, climate change and other red-versus-blue divides.Using phrases like \u201cTed Cruz is for Ted Cruz\u201d and \u201call talk and no action,\u201d and questioning whether the senator had delivered any results for Texas, Mr. O\u2019Rourke took his most personal shot at his opponent when Mr. Cruz expressed skepticism about climate change and argued that Mr. O\u2019Rourke supported higher taxes on oil. The congressman invoked an attack line that Donald J. Trump had used against Mr. Cruz in the 2016 presidential race.\u201cSenator Cruz is not going to be honest with you,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cHe\u2019s dishonest, and it\u2019s why the president called him Lyin\u2019 Ted, and it\u2019s why the nickname stuck \u2014 because it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s clear Congressman O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pollsters have told him to come out on the attack,\u201d Mr. Cruz replied.In their first debate last month, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was largely reserved and anything but aggressive. He had trouble boiling down his expansive responses into memorable zingers, and his just-good-enough performance most likely played at least some role in Mr. Cruz\u2019s recent lead in the polls. On Tuesday, however, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was far sharper and edgier. He sweated more, used his hands and arms to punctuate his arguments and repeatedly cast Mr. Cruz as dishonest, ineffective, more focused on running for president than representing Texas and beholden to corporate interests.In one exchange, Mr. Cruz was asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war. Mr. Cruz said he was against it, and pivoted to talk about Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks about impeaching the president, calling his opponent \u201cthe only Democratic Senate nominee in the country who has explicitly come out for impeaching President Trump.\u201d He added that if Mr. O\u2019Rourke had his way, there would be \u201ctwo years of a partisan circus\u201d aimed at ousting the president.Mr. O\u2019Rourke replied, \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus, after your last six years in the U.S. Senate.\u201d Then he switched gears as well, to talk about Mr. Cruz\u2019s relationship with Mr. Trump, who is coming to Houston on Monday to hold a rally for Mr. Cruz.\u201cListen,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cif you have this special relationship with President Trump, then where is the result of that? You are all talk and no action.\u201dBut Mr. Cruz largely kept his cool, and even chuckled out loud at some of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s attacks. He continued to paint Mr. O\u2019Rourke as a liberal who is too radical for Texas and who wants to steer the state away from the low-tax, low-regulation mantra that Republicans view as the key to the Texas economy\u2019s success.\u201cHave you noticed in this debate he doesn\u2019t talk about what he has accomplished in Congress?\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cBecause he has scored political points rather than accomplishing victories for the people of Texas.\u201dOnly once did Mr. Cruz grow audibly frustrated \u2014 but that was aimed at one of the two moderators, Jason Whitely, a senior reporter at WFAA-TV in Dallas. Responding to a question about incivility in politics, Mr. Cruz made a point about partisanship, saying, \u201cThere is an anger, there is a rage on the far left.\u201d When Mr. Whitely tried to interject, Mr. Cruz said sharply, \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me, Jason,\u201d and then continued discussing his views on treating others with respect.\u201cThe personal attacks, the going to the gutter that is so common in politics, I\u2019ve tried not to engage in,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.The displays of fireworks aside, there was no single significant moment in the debate that seemed certain to help or hurt the two candidates with about three weeks to go to Election Day. Mr. O\u2019Rourke was clearly aiming to energize his base of voters and trying to remind Texas independents and moderates of misgivings they may have about Mr. Cruz.On Wednesday morning, President Trump weighed in on the debate, declaring his support for Mr. Cruz and calling Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u201ca flake\u2019\u2019 who was \u201cnot in the same league with Ted Cruz.\u2019\u2019The two candidates clashed from the first question, about the security of voting and whether Congress should regulate social media companies. Mr. O\u2019Rourke said that voting and the ballot box were \u201cunder attack\u201d more than \u201cany other time in our nation\u2019s history\u201d and argued that Senator Cruz had not done enough to finance greater election security measures. He also criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, given Russian\u2019s interference in the 2016 American election, and pledged to \u201cstand up\u201d to Mr. Trump while saying Mr. Cruz had not.Mr. Cruz said he had supported legislation to do more to protect American voting, but also focused on \u201cpolitical bias of big tech, of Facebook and Google\u201d and said he was concerned that social media was not protecting free political speech on social media.Mr. O\u2019Rourke also criticized Mr. Cruz for opposing the Violence Against Women Act, while the senator presented himself as a strong supporter of the #MeToo movement and victims of sexual assault and misconduct.\u201cThe #MeToo movement has done an incredible amount of good for our country,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cI believe everyone, women and men, girls and boys, need to be protected.\u201d As the father of two girls, and the son and husband of women who had careers, he noted that he helped lead a Senate effort to stop secret settlements by members of Congress over sexual harassment complaints.Mr. Cruz and Mr. O\u2019Rourke were facing off for the second and perhaps final time, as Mr. Cruz seeks to widen his lead in the polls and Mr. O\u2019Rourke tries to restore dimming Democratic hopes that he can unseat Mr. Cruz and pull off the biggest upset in modern Texas political history.The battle between Mr. Cruz and Mr. O\u2019Rourke has captivated and polarized Texas and drawn enormous interest nationwide, with the candidates raising far more money than those in typical Senate races. Mr. O\u2019Rourke raised a record-breaking $38.1 million in the last three months alone, the most of any Senate candidate ever. And he has enjoyed a kind of pop-culture celebrity status, getting a shout-out from the young El Paso soul singer Khalid at the American Music Awards and jamming on stage with Willie Nelson. On Thursday, he will appear in a live town-hall event on CNN in the border city of McAllen.Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s CNN town hall has become a contested issue. The Cruz campaign asked CNN to change the format of the event into a town-hall debate and to allow the two candidates to hold their third debate there. In a letter to CNN, Jeff Roe, Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, wrote that if they were going to spend an hour \u201con national cable news discussing and debating the issues important to Texas voters, we believe it should be on a stage with our opponent.\u201dThe network had originally invited both candidates to participate in a town hall, with each candidate appearing separately on the stage in individual segments. The Cruz campaign had accepted but later backed out, the network said. CNN said in response to the Cruz campaign request that it would convert the event into a debate if the O\u2019Rourke campaign agreed to the change.It was unclear if Mr. O\u2019Rourke was going to agree. Although three debates were originally scheduled, one of them set for Houston was postponed, and it was uncertain whether it would be rescheduled. It seemed possible that Tuesday night\u2019s debate was the final one.Texas Democrats remain cautiously optimistic, with some more cautious and others more optimistic.Few, if any, Democrats running statewide in Texas in recent decades have generated the amount of enthusiasm that Mr. O\u2019Rourke has. In the 2014 race for governor, the party\u2019s nominee, Wendy Davis, enjoyed an initial wave of excitement but then trailed the Republican, Greg Abbott, by up to 12 percentage points in the polls four months before the election, and some Democrats were publicly and privately grumbling about her campaign\u2019s missteps.Mr. O\u2019Rourke is running a tighter race and a smoother campaign, effectively turning much of his life into a social-media live stream, allowing his supporters to watch him as he drives between events and gets a haircut.\u201cHe\u2019s probably running the best campaign that\u2019s been run in Texas in my lifetime,\u201d said Garry Mauro, a former state land commissioner who was the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in Texas in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m on his Facebook. At one time yesterday he had 13,000 people watching him drive in the car.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.On Tuesday night, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was lucky to have made it into the studios at all. Before the debate, the parking attendant outside the KENS 5 television station was surprised when Mr. O\u2019Rourke pulled in driving his own vehicle. He regularly drives himself campaigning around the state. Debate night was no different.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a pass, I don\u2019t know how to get you through,\u201d the attendant told Mr. O\u2019Rourke. His wife, Amy O\u2019Rourke, sat in the car, joined by staff members. They were live-streaming the drive to the debate on his Facebook page.\u201cThis is how you know it\u2019s real,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. After some consultation, the parking attendant sent Mr. O\u2019Rourke in.\u201cThank you,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThank you for your service.\u201dHe rolled up the window.\u201cWe passed the first hurdle,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke added.Advertisement"}

But Many of Its Donors Are Embracing Democrats.", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Charles Myers, the chairman of a financial advisory firm, hosted four relatively unknown Democratic congressional candidates at his Midtown Manhattan home last month, he netted more money than he can remember collecting from an event that wasn\u2019t headlined by a presidential candidate.\u201cMore than ever in my 26-year career on Wall Street, donors are willing to look way beyond concerns of overregulation from Democrats,\u201d said Mr. Myers, a longtime Democratic fund-raiser. They just want to elect \u201cDemocrats to serve as a check\u201d on President Trump.The stock market may be booming. Unemployment is hitting record lows. Republicans pushed through $1.5 trillion in tax cuts.But despite all that, for the first time in a decade, the broader financial community is on pace to give more money to Democratic congressional candidates and incumbents than their Republican counterparts, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign donations.Some of the same grass-roots energy coursing through the Democratic Party \u2014 House candidates from Kentucky to Montana to New York are reporting record sums of small donations \u2014 has spilled into the corporate boardrooms of American finance, even amid increasingly hostile rhetoric from Democrats in Washington and on the campaign trail toward Wall Street.\u201cWhen one party controls all the levers, it is a lot easier for the opposing party to motivate donors,\u201d said Marc Short, the former Trump White House director of legislative affairs, who has deep relationships in the donor world. \u201cIt\u2019s both money and activism. But obviously much of the money comes from Wall Street.\u201dIn interviews with two dozen Wall Street executives, fund-raisers, donors and those who raise money from them, Democrats described an extraordinary level of investment and excitement from the finance sector. And many Republicans fretted about a softening of donor enthusiasm \u2014 Mr. Short warned of \u201ccomplacency\u201d \u2014 in what has long been one of the party\u2019s most critical and reliable sources of campaign cash.The numbers are stark.That figure will shift, possibly substantially, when candidates reveal their latest fund-raising hauls later this month. But Democrats have already surpassed their 2012 and 2014 totals, and most Republicans with ties to Wall Street described a grim political outlook, even as the confirmation of Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court brought renewed energy nationally to their party.\u201cYou\u2019ve got a midterm election coming up that looks right now fairly bleak for the Republicans,\u201d said Stephen Moore, the conservative economist who founded the Club for Growth and maintains close ties to Wall Street donors.\u201cWall Street is \u2014 and corporate America is \u2014 pretty famous for hedging their bets,\u201d Mr. Moore said. \u201cThey just want to follow winners. They just want to make sure they have access to the people who win. This is no exception.\u201dSome Republicans, including Mr. Moore, cited residual anger from the tax-cut bill, which eliminated a key deduction for state and local taxes in blue states such as New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, where most of Wall Street\u2019s big earners live. Others pointed to Mr. Trump\u2019s personality and his social and cultural agenda that has proved divisive, especially among college-educated voters.\u201cA lot of Mitt Romney donors are doing nothing,\u201d said one New York financial executive and Republican fund-raiser, who, like many, spoke on condition of anonymity to maintain relationships with contributors. \u201cA lot of these guys just completely disappeared.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Many midlevel donors seem to be simply sitting out this cycle, according to Republican officials; some big contributors have been slower or more reluctant to give ahead of expected losses.From donors in just the securities and investment sector, Democratic congressional incumbents and candidates have so far received $39.3 million in 2018, compared with $28 million for Republicans. That is a reversal from 2014, when Democrats raised $28 million and Republicans $41.5 million. In 2018, 15 of the top 20 congressional recipients of securities and investment industry cash are Democrats; in 2014, 15 of the top 20 were Republicans.The totals do not include independent super PAC giving, and the next round of disclosures, which will run through the end of September, will be released later this month.Despite the balance sheet shifting to the left, Wall Street remains a wellspring of financial support for Republicans. Political action committee money from Wall Street, which makes up about a third of total giving so far, still tilts Republican. And Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity Blackstone Group and an adviser to Mr. Trump, for instance, has already donated $7.25 million to super PACs benefiting House and Senate Republicans.In September, Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and a senior White House adviser, spoke to a gathering of top Republican Party donors in Manhattan that included some of the billionaire titans of Wall Street. Among them: Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade; Daniel S. Loeb, the hedge fund manager of Third Point L.L.C.; Charles R. Schwab, the founder of Charles Schwab Corporation; and Paul Singer, the hedge fund magnate who runs Elliott Management Corporation.And this month, Speaker Paul Ryan is scheduled to brief a small group of top New York-area donors at the office of Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of American International Group, according to an invitation obtained by The New York Times.Mr. Wentworth questioned the deductions provision of the tax bill, among other policies pursued by a Republican-controlled Washington. \u201cIt was almost like the New York metropolitan area \u2014 we had a target on our back,\u201d he said.Giving to once-obscure House candidates is suddenly in vogue, with Democratic donors saying it has never-seen-before cachet in finance circles.\u201cWhat I have never seen in my lifetime is the level of energy for all these local races,\u201d said Orin Kramer, a veteran Democratic fund-raiser and founder of a hedge fund. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such an appetite for candidates who people have never heard of.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a matter of degree,\u201d added Mr. Kramer, who has contributed to the House Victory Project and hosted events of his own. \u201cIt\u2019s a phenomenon that hasn\u2019t existed before.\u201dOf course, in the age of super PACs, billionaire donors can still have an outsize impact with a single check. And Mr. Trump can conceivably make up any missing donors on Wall Street with financial support elsewhere, just as he drove different voters to the polls in 2016 as some traditional Republicans stayed home.The single biggest donor of the cycle is the former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who made his multibillion-dollar fortune selling computer terminals to Wall Street. He has pledged $100 million for the Democrats. The largest Republican contributor is the casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. He and his wife have contributed $55 million to Republican super PACs.To rally Wall Street support, Republican leaders have been sounding the alarm not just about the broader threat of a Nancy Pelosi-led House, but specifically about who is in line to chair the powerful Financial Services Committee: Representative Maxine Waters of California, a liberal firebrand whom Mr. Trump has also taken to attacking by name.\u201cFinance people \u2014 when they find out that Maxine Waters is going to be in charge of finance \u2014 they panic,\u201d said John Catsimatidis, a billionaire Trump donor in New York, who was one of the few who said he said he saw no softening among Republican donor interest on Wall Street.Last month, when Mr. Ryan briefed members of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce about the stakes of the election and the regulations that Democratic control could unleash, he name-checked potential Democratic committee chairs, including Ms. Waters, according to two attendees.For Democrats, Mr. Trump himself has proved a unifying message when seeking out financial industry contributors.\u201cYou would expect, with the economy doing as well as it is today, that there would be a desire to keep the status quo,\u201d said Thomas R. Nides, a former adviser to Hillary Clinton now working on Wall Street. But he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think people care. They\u2019re worried about the direction of the country.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Crown Prince Calls Khashoggi\u2019s Death \u2018Heinous\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIYADH, Saudi Arabia \u2014 The crown prince of Saudi Arabia on Wednesday denounced the \u201cheinous crime\u201d committed against Jamal Khashoggi, the dissident writer killed in Turkey. It was his most public attempt yet to separate himself from Saudi operatives suspected of the killing, who include some of the crown prince\u2019s own aides.The comments by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, were made during a panel discussion at an opulent investor conference in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. They came as the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Turkey continued to sour over the Oct. 2 killing at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, and as Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic and political ties with the West are increasingly at risk.Prince Mohammed insisted that Turkey and Saudi Arabia were collaborating to bring those who committed the killing to justice.\u201cThe crime was really painful to all Saudis, and I believe it is painful to every human in the world,\u201d he said in Arabic, according to a simultaneous translation. \u201cIt is a heinous crime that cannot be justified.\u201dA Saudi-Turkey split, he said, \u201cwill not happen, and we will prove to the world that the two governments are cooperating to punish any criminal, any guilty person, and justice in the end will appear.\u201dThe crown prince\u2019s comments came amid reports by both Saudi and Turkish news agencies that he had spoken by telephone about the Khashoggi case with Saudi Arabia\u2019s principal accuser, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. It was the first official word that the two leaders, considered regional rivals, had spoken about the case.Earlier in the day, Mr. Erdogan repeated his demand that those responsible for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death be brought to justice. \u201cWe are determined not to allow a cover-up of this murder,\u201d he said in a speech to Turkey\u2019s State Council.Some of the crown prince\u2019s close subordinates have been implicated by Turkish officials in the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, 59, a Washington Post columnist.Western intelligence officials have said the Saudi agents would almost certainly not have acted without the knowledge of or instructions from the 33-year-old crown prince, who is considered the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia.For weeks, the Saudi royal authorities insisted that Mr. Khashoggi had left the Istanbul consulate the same day he visited. It was only this past Saturday that the Saudi authorities admitted he had been killed inside the building, describing it as an accident. They said 18 Saudis suspected of involvement had been detained in Saudi Arabia.Turkish officials have said they have evidence including audio recordings that a team of Saudi assassins killed Mr. Khashoggi within minutes of his entry to the consulate, dismembered his body and then tried to cover up his death \u2014 even creating a fictitious trail by having a Saudi agent who resembled Mr. Khashoggi walk out of the consulate wearing the victim\u2019s clothes.President Trump, a close ally of the Saudi royal family, has said he is skeptical of the Saudi explanations for what happened and has called the cover-up \u201cone of the worst.\u201dIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that ties between the United States and Saudi Arabia would be damaged if the crown prince had been dishonest with him. \u201cCertainly it would be a very bad thing in terms of relationship,\u201d the president said. \u201cIt would take a while to rebuild.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s Central Intelligence Agency director, Gina Haspel, has been in Turkey for the past few days to get more information from her Turkish counterparts.The Sabah, a pro-government Turkish newspaper, reported that Turkish officials had shared evidence including audio recordings with Ms. Haspel. American intelligence officials would not comment on Ms. Haspel\u2019s meeting.For the recordings to have real usefulness to the C.I.A. or other agencies, the Turks would have to provide a full copy so American intelligence operatives can perform technical analysis and establish their authenticity. But even then, the recordings would most likely be of little value on the key policy question: whether the Saudi crown prince was connected to the killing, officials briefed on the intelligence said.The officials said there was little reason to doubt the basic Turkish account of Mr. Khashoggi being brutally murdered in the consulate. But the officials said intelligence agencies remain unconvinced that any of the information gathered from the consulate will resolve the fundamental question of the crown prince\u2019s involvement.Some government officials believe Prince Mohammed ordered action to be taken against Mr. Khashoggi but did not intend for him to be killed. Others believe Prince Mohammed wanted him killed.Saudi Arabia has denied that its leaders ordered the operation against Mr. Khashoggi or even knew that it had taken place until days later.Mr. Hariri did not address the incident, instead focusing his remarks on the development of Lebanon\u2019s economy. But Prince Mohammed sought to joke about it.\u201cHis Excellency Prime Minister Saad is staying for two days in Saudi Arabia,\u201d the crown prince said, \u201cso I hope that rumors don\u2019t start that he\u2019s been kidnapped.\u201dMostly, the crown prince used the appearance to promote what he described as his country\u2019s rich and glorious future.\u201cI don\u2019t think that there is any challenge before the great Saudi people,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of our projects are proceeding, reform is proceeding, our war on extremism is proceeding, our war on terrorism is proceeding, developing the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is proceeding. No matter how they try to stop our efforts, we won\u2019t stop.\u201dHe suggested that the countries of the Middle East could one day form an economic engine like Europe. And in a surprising note of magnanimity, the crown prince said that even Qatar \u2014 a neighboring adversary targeted by a Saudi-led embargo \u2014 had a dynamic economy that would play an important role in the future of the region.Prince Mohammed was greeted with an ovation as he entered the ballroom at the Ritz Carlton hotel, where business leaders from around the world have converged to network and make deals \u2014 though many canceled last week, citing the stigma of the Khashoggi scandal.Despite the Khashoggi uproar, the conference hummed along on its second day, with discussions focused on capital markets, sovereign wealth funds and investing in Saudi Arabia\u2019s emerging technology sectors.Although pitches were being made in the hotel\u2019s hallways, it was premature to say whether the absence of top American bankers would be a drag on deal making or open new opportunities for investors from Russia and China.On Tuesday, Saudi Aramco announced the signing of 15 deals worth more than $30 billion with companies in eight countries: the United States, France, China, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, South Korea and India.It remains to be seen whether the crown prince\u2019s remarks about Mr. Khashoggi will allay the lingering concerns.\u201cIt was something he had to do in some form,\u201d said Ralph Simon, the chief executive Mobilium Global, a London-based mobile technology company. \u201cThere was a lot of opposition to people coming to this event and I was hoping there would be some form of public statement.\u201d[Read about the uproar over the handshake.]Foreign critics of Saudi Arabia also widened on Wednesday to include the top leadership of its regional nemesis Iran, which had been conspicuously silent on the Khashoggi killing.Mr. Rouhani also suggested the killers had been emboldened and encouraged by the United States, which regards Saudi Arabia as its principal Arab ally. \u201cI don\u2019t think any country dares to commit such a crime without a green light from the U.S.,\u201d he was quoted as saying.Saudi officials at the investment conference tried to keep the focus off Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing and on their big plans for the kingdom.\u201cIt was a tragedy and a very shocking moment for all for all of us, and I think everyone has to make the decision for themselves,\u201d said Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, who had just given a talk about her work with the Saudi sports authority.\u201cThere are 33 million people in this country who are trying very hard to move this country forward, and we have a very clear vision,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is why we are telling people to take the initiative to invest in our future.\u201dReporting was contributed by Ben Hubbard from Beirut, Lebanon; Carlotta Gall from Istanbul; David D.

{"Headline": "Foretelling the Future of Oil", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhat is the future of oil?It\u2019s hard if not impossible to say for sure, but there are few more important questions, since the answer will be a key guide to the fate of humanity over the next century.It\u2019s worth speculating about because the climate will depend on it, with the burning of gasoline and diesel key drivers for global warming. The balance of international power is also in play, with the future fortunes of such foes as Russia and Iran tied to the commodity. Huge fortunes could be made or lost from any shifts in the energy economy, which is currently controlled by some of the largest private and state corporations in the world.Predicting the energy sources of the future has always been a fool\u2019s game. In the 1950s, nuclear energy was supposed to promise cheap power for all but is now in eclipse. Biofuels seemed to hold great promise a decade ago, but now are little more than an afterthought. When most experts thought the country\u2019s oil reserves were in decline, shale drilling unleashed a boom in natural gas and oil production that now seems to perpetuate the dependence on fossil fuels except coal.A plan by Norway\u2019s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund to divest of $40 billion in oil stocks is meeting reluctance from within the government.\u201cThe demand for oil continues to grow even as there is an increased focus on controlling emissions and addressing the climate agenda,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian and author of \u201cThe Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money & Power.\u201d But he added that he would not discount an eventual change in the direction of energy markets, even while it is \u201cdifficult to predict a breakthrough that perhaps is now unimaginable. The big change may be a merger of Silicon Valley and Houston.\u201dBig oil is beginning to hedge its bets on the future, under pressure from activist investors and the public, while also worrying about future regulation. A pivot may be starting, with ExxonMobil and BP engineers working on advanced batteries, Royal Dutch Shell scientists working on hydrogen fuel cells, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign wealth fund investing in Tesla, and the oil industry broadly deploying artificial intelligence, robotics and faster data processing throughout their operations.Many experts remain skeptical that oil companies will be at the forefront of change and undercut their own businesses. Regardless of who leads the change away from oil \u2014 if there indeed is a change \u2014 there are already growing signs that global demand for oil will peak and decline to some degree by the late 2030s.That would not be fast enough for the world to achieve the goal of the 2015 Paris climate agreement to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius above pre-Industrial Age levels. Still, it would mark one of the most remarkable economic swings of the last century, given that global demand for oil has more than tripled since 1965.In what may be a sign of things to come, India has announced that by 2030, all new cars sold in the country will be electric.Norwegian risk-management firm DNV GL raised eyebrows across the oil industry in September by forecasting that demand for crude will crest in the early 2020s.Most of the major oil companies are counting on petrochemicals and plastics to continue to drive oil profits. They also hope the natural gas they produce and ship will continue to replace coal burning for electricity generation.Not surprisingly, oil executives typically scoff at the notion of a world without oil.Mr. Sealock and many other oil executives do not deny that climate change is an issue, nor that it is caused by the burning of fossil fuels.He points to technology as the solution that will allow societies to continue burning them safely, noting efforts by the billionaire investor Bill Gates and others to extract carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through advanced industrial-scale engineering.Mr. Sealock and a few other oil executives see the possibility that natural gas, which frequently bubbles up with oil from the same wells, could provide the raw material for the production of hydrogen for fuel cells that would limit the exhaust of cars to drops of water.That may all be wishful thinking on the part of Mr. Sealock, who is managing a company that is attempting to unlock billions of new barrels of oil. If he is right, that could be a convenient solution not only for the climate (unless there are unintended negative consequences to fiddling with the atmosphere as some fear), but also for a slew of countries that rely on oil for their economic well-being across much of Africa and the Middle East, as well as Russia, Mexico and emerging producers like Brazil and Guyana.But there is another view, decidedly a minority one still, that believes the days of the fossil fuel age are numbered. One such futurist is Dieter Helm, an Oxford University energy economist and author of \u201cBurn Out: The Endgame for Fossil Fuels,\u201d published last year, who says he believes that the world is poised for a technological transformation that will produce new sources of power, advanced energy storage and a rise in the efficiency of the economy so less energy is needed.\u201cWe know the supply of solar is infinite,\u201d Mr. Helm said. And in the next 20 years, he added, \u201cWe\u2019ll have factories that run on robots, we\u2019ll have 3-D printing, artificial intelligence and so on that will make energy demand remarkably more flexible in factories, offices and houses too.\u201dSuch technologies are already taking hold, and in Mr. Helm\u2019s view they will speed up as global leaders are forced to manage the impacts of climate change, which appear to be accelerating. It\u2019s not going to immediately happen, but he says he believes the big oil companies will eventually go the way of the horse and buggy.\u201cWhy do you think Exxon is better at battery or new storage technology than a start up?\u201d he said. \u201cJust like the Telcos didn\u2019t take over the internet world, they will try, they will do a bit, but I think very gradually they will decay.\u201dSome oil company executives say they are accepting the challenge of a lower carbon world, and they are ready to adapt.One of the leaders is Eldar Saetre, chief executive of the Norwegian oil giant Equinor, whose company is a pioneer in offshore wind power.While Equinor has acknowledged that it will have to leave some hydrocarbons in the ground, Mr. Saetre said his industry is going to have to adjust faster.\u201cThere are companies that could do more,\u201d Mr. Saetre said, choosing his words carefully.\u201cI see a lot of players with a conscious and aggressive approach, but it\u2019s an evolution and there is room for more engagement in our industry.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Long before cocaine wars and guerrilla insurgencies nearly destroyed Colombia in the 1980s and \u201990s, some 200,000 people perished in a civil war in the 1940s through the \u201960s because the country\u2019s liberals and conservatives couldn\u2019t settle their ideological differences peacefully.Politics played as blood sport degrades personal manners and ruins civic institutions.

Colombians know, because it has taken them three generations to work their way out of the wreckage, and they\u2019re far from done.Colombia\u2019s effort to steer clear of both should be an inspiration. The refugee crisis has put immense pressure on its vulnerable economy. But Duque has refused to scapegoat the migrants or turn his back on them. \u201cWe will never close our borders,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause we want to build this fraternity and because we know that this is a bigger challenge.\u201dWhat a difference between Duque\u2019s approach and the \u201cbuild the wall and imprison the kids\u201d crowd currently in power in Washington, Budapest, Rome and other right-wing redoubts.

Instead, Duque is calling forthrightly for maximum pressure on Caracas, with a clear view toward ending Maduro\u2019s rule. He disavows military solutions \u201cbecause that is what the dictator wants.\u201d But he\u2019s fairly explicit in calling on Venezuelans to take matters in their own hands, and even more so in applying crushing sanctions on the regime.\u201cMartin Luther King used to say that silence can turn you into an accomplice,\u201d he says. \u201cThe stage where we are right now is the stage where we can no longer be indifferent. The whole international community must react.\u201dThose of us who are skeptics of peace deals with terrorists would say: \u201cTold you so.\u201d Duque is committed to keeping but amending the accords. But he complains about the way in which the word \u201cpeace\u201d was manipulated by his predecessor into a partisan wedge issue by treating opponents of the agreement as \u201cenemies of peace.\u201dIn the age of Trump, it\u2019s easy to forget that elitism and demagoguery can also mix with noxious results. Anyone tagged a \u201cwarmonger\u201d simply because they thought the Iran deal was badly negotiated knows the feeling.We are now at a moment when populist demagogues of right or left have won or made major gains in nearly every important recent election: in Pakistan and Mexico; Italy and Sweden; the U.K. and the U.S. It might yet happen again this month in Brazil.To debate the overarching causes is somewhat useless. Unhappy families, to borrow Tolstoy\u2019s line, are unhappy in their own way. Then again, happy families are alike, and so are countries.

{"Headline": "For China, a Bridge Over the Adriatic Is a Road Into Europe", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKOMARNA, Croatia \u2014 As a quirk of history and the Balkan wars, a corner of Croatia is cut off from the rest of the country by a 12-mile interruption of land belonging to neighboring Bosnia. It is a rift that Croatia has long wanted to repair with a bridge that would unite the disconnected sliver of its coast with the rest of the country.For decades \u2014 foiled by war, corruption, political bickering and global financial turmoil \u2014 work never got much further on the bridge than abandoned concrete pylons and two bronze angels overlooking the glittering waters of the Adriatic Sea.That is, until the Chinese arrived this summer.With drills churning and its engineers arriving daily, a state-owned Chinese construction firm, the China Road and Bridge Corporation, is the latest company to take on the project.For many Croatians, just the possibility that the long-awaited bridge project is now on track to be completed is reason for celebration.But the project is also a test case for the European Union, which has been wary of allowing state-owned Chinese firms into the market for big European infrastructure projects, fearing that Chinese companies can undermine competition, trample the bloc\u2019s labor laws and depress wages.The bridge, which will span the water separating a peninsula in the disconnected region with the village of Komarna and the rest of Croatia, is the first time that a project funded largely with European Union money has been won by a Chinese firm.80 MILESSLOVENIAZagrebCROATIABOSNIA ANDHERZEGOVINADetail areaITALY10 milesKomarnaBosnia andHerzegovinaNeumCroatiaAdriatic SeaDubrovnikBy The New York TimesChina Road and Bridge won the contract with a proposal that undercut the nearest competitor by nearly $100 million, leading to a legal challenge. The European Commission is also investigating whether Croatia awarded the contract in line with European Union rules.On top of the concerns officials have over competitive practices and lower wages, many of the jobs that come with the project may not even go to workers in the slow-growing economies of Europe.Typically, Chinese state firms bring most of their own workers for construction projects, an often contentious practice. It is not clear if Croatian authorities even know how much the Chinese workers will be paid. China Road and Bridge did not respond to queries, and the Croatian authorities said they did not want to officially comment.\u201cEuropean companies are increasingly finding themselves in the situation that they cannot compete with Chinese-subsidized companies on price levels,\u201d said Jens Bastian, an economic analyst who has detailed Chinese investments and loans in the Balkans in a report for the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.In a 2016 report, the European Union Institute for Security Studies concluded that the bloc may \u201chave to acknowledge its limited leverage when it comes to influencing Chinese corporate behavior.\u201dYet for Croatia, which joined the European Union in 2013, the project has become a neat and relatively cheap fix for a once insolvable problem in a Balkans region where bridges have long played outsize roles in politics and diplomacy.When rulers sought to unite the region\u2019s ethnic and religious groups, bridges were built across rivers and over valley passes. When leaders wanted to divide people along ethnic lines, those same bridges were often fought over or destroyed to keep communities apart.The gap in Croatia\u2019s territory occurred after the socialist Yugoslavia dissolved and frontiers between its former republics became international borders. The Neum corridor, the strip of Bosnia\u2019s coastline that cuts Croatia in two, is Bosnia\u2019s only access to the Adriatic Sea.As things stand, people traveling from Croatia\u2019s southern coast must endure four border checkpoints to reach the rest of the country, which can mean delays of hours that disrupt one of the nation\u2019s chief economic drivers, tourism.\u201cThis project genuinely embodies our commitment to removing barriers, uniting territories and bringing people together,\u201d Corina Cretu, the union\u2019s commissioner for regional policy, said at the time.Yet six months later, the situation became more complicated when Croatia awarded the project to China Road and Bridge. Rivals were furious. A Croatian court later dismissed a complaint from a losing bidder, the Austrian firm Strabag, which accused the Chinese consortium of charging a price that was lower than the actual value of the project.On a recent afternoon at the construction site, Jeroslav Segedin, a civil engineer, gave a tour of the early stages of the project. Mr. Segedin, a representative of Croatia Roads, which contracted with the Chinese company for the project, stressed the importance of the bridge, despite the concerns about Beijing\u2019s involvement.\u201cIt means a lot to both Croatia and this region,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a national symbol for Croatia.\u201dMr. Segedin, whose team of civil engineers will oversee the project, said construction should reach its peak in about 18 months, when there are expected to be 490 workers on the bridge, most of them Chinese living in trailers on the sparsely populated peninsula. Croatian workers will take part in the construction, but only on a small scale.The uncertainty around how many Chinese workers will be employed at the site, and what they will be paid, has spawned rumors.\u201cIt\u2019s incredible, the calls I\u2019ve been getting regarding the Chinese workers in our region,\u201d said Smiljan Mustapic, the governor of the Slivno area where the bridge is being built. \u201cIt\u2019s like a group of aliens has landed.\u201dFor now, the bridge construction is focused under water and requires only a few dozen Chinese engineers.The ostensible reason for the joint patrols was to help resolve issues related to Chinese tourists. But it also served as a dry run for Croatia\u2019s plans to host a meeting of the Chinese-led investment initiative, known as 16+1, in Dubrovnik next year. It includes 11 European Union members in Central and Eastern Europe along with five Balkan nations.Mr. Mustapic, the governor of the area where the bridge is being built, said, \u201cFor us, the construction of this bridge is priceless.\u201dHe could not help but be overcome, he said, as he saw the lights on the water that marked the start of the work on the bridge\u2019s foundation.\u201cIt meant that this time, it is going to happen,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Can Colorado Save America? ", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "OpinionIt\u2019s impossible to drive across the state and not be reminded of the first boundlessness of American potential. Supported byOpinion ColumnistNucla, population just over 700, was founded around 1900 by a utopian socialist group, lived off uranium mining during the Cold War and has now turned to the cultivation of marijuana\u2019s cousin, hemp, in a stab at a revival. It\u2019s heavily Republican, like most of small-town America. It is also part of what Deana Sheriff, an economic recovery coordinator, called \u201cthe Mild West\u201d \u2014 complete with broadband and a mill for heritage grains. Nobody is running around with six-shooters on hips taking potshots at streetlights.On the eve of critical midterm elections, Colorado presents an American microcosm, its population of 5.6 million split more or less evenly among Republicans, Democrats and independents. Liberals, including an influx of immigrants, tend to inhabit the more urban Front Range, east of the Rockies; Trump support is intense in the rural Western Slope. Montrose County, home to Nucla, voted 67.9 percent for Trump in 2016; Colorado, thanks mainly to Denver and Boulder, gave Hillary Clinton a narrow victory.John Hickenlooper, the term-limited Democratic governor, told me that when he goes to the East Coast, \u201cI do feel like an outsider. The way we approach things here, it\u2019s almost like we\u2019re speaking a different language. In the West, I think there is an inclination, almost an instinct, to sit down with people you disagree with and sort of sort through\u201d \u2014 as he did with the oil and gas industry to produce a rational energy policy, the nation\u2019s first regulatory framework limiting future emissions.Might he, eyeing 2020, run for the Democratic Party nomination for president on this can-do, bridge-building platform? \u201cWe are certainly looking at it,\u201d Hickenlooper said. \u201cWe spent the summer talking to people that are really smart. I\u2019m preparing, but don\u2019t think I\u2019d make a decision probably until February.\u201dThat sounds to me like a yes. A Hickenlooper candidacy would be interesting because there\u2019s no way to govern Colorado, as he has for eight years, without dealing with the way Trump has tapped into a deep-seated economic and cultural frustration. Trump support is no abstraction here, or cause for derision. It\u2019s a fact. The feeling of being left behind, forgotten or cheated by a rigged system in a country of sharpening inequality is America\u2019s core dilemma. The question now is who will more effectively convince Americans that the American dream can be restored: Trump, with his unscrupulous rabble-rousing and America-first nationalism masking tax and other policies that favor the one percent, or a Democratic Party that rediscovers the ability to speak to small-town and blue-collar and barely middle-class America (like the teachers who went on strike in Colorado this year) in a way that does not sound patronizing? At the 5th Avenue Grill in Nucla, with its trophy elk on the wall and a sign saying \u201cHome of the Free Because of the Brave,\u201d Bob Ralph, a plumber, had no doubt. He told me: \u201cA year ago we would have been the only ones here. Now you have to wait for a table. The hardware store has people waiting in line. People are eager to open businesses. I hope Trump will be a two-term president.\u201dIn the last 10 presidential elections, going back to 1980, Colorado has voted Republican six times but Democratic in the last three. It\u2019s a state with a strong libertarian streak, suspicious of government, and so in a sense Republican-inclined; but it\u2019s been won over by strong local Democratic leadership. \u201cIt\u2019s not at all a blue state to be taken for granted; things can easily be reversed,\u201d Ken Salazar, a former secretary of the interior in the Obama administration and a Colorado native, told me. \u201cPeople will vote for results-oriented candidates. Results matter: That\u2019s the Coloradan standard.\u201d\u201cThe one thing you learn in the restaurant business,\u201d the governor told me, \u201cis there is no margin in having enemies. The only way you persuade someone is to listen harder.\u201d[Discover the most compelling features, reporting and humor writing from The New York Times Opinion section, selected by our editors. Sign up for the Sunday Best newsletter.]As a two-term Denver mayor starting in 2003, and now a two-term governor, Hickenlooper has listened, driven by the conviction that, as he put it, \u201cWe don\u2019t have the luxury to kind of wallow in the partisan mud pit, right?\u201dSome issues elude compromise, of course. In 2013, after the Aurora theater mass shooting the previous year, Hickenlooper signed into law a ban on high-capacity gun magazines that hold more than 15 rounds. This is the measure that incensed Richard Craig and led, as a protest, to Nucla\u2019s obligatory gun-ownership ordinance.\u201cI just got mad because these talking heads decided we did not need high-capacity magazines, and we ended up losing a firearms accessory factory with dozens of jobs that went to Wyoming,\u201d Craig said.Over in nearby Grand Junction, the largest town on the Western Slope, such views are widespread, even if the Mild West is evident again on a Main Street offering lattes, pottery and beads. On the way into town is a large billboard that went up after Trump\u2019s ignominious July meeting with President Vladimir Putin of Russia. It says \u201cG.O.P.\u201d on a red background with the \u201cO\u201d replaced by the Communist hammer-and-sickle.I met Landman, who moved to Grand Junction from Los Angeles, \u201cbecause you can still be by yourself on the final frontier,\u201d in a bagel cafe. To her, the Trump phenomenon has been about releasing xenophobic emotions suppressed as the country headed in a direction many did not like. \u201cIt\u2019s scary to see it. And now that box has been opened, I\u2019m not sure how we close it again.\u201d As we spoke, Elisa Allen, who was on vacation with her family from Baltimore and had seen the billboard, approached. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to find some sanity in the craziness,\u201d she said, pressing $40 on Landman. I drove across town to see Pastor Robert Babcox, who dismissed the billboard as a vile insult (\u201clike saying all Democrats are Nazis\u201d) and listed his reasons for backing Trump.I asked Babcox about a Hickenlooper run for president. \u201cHe\u2019d be foolish to do that, does not stand a chance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat a silly law that high-capacity magazine thing is! He wants to make us like California, but you\u2019re not going to have Priuses around here.\u201dSo are Democrats the enemy? Babcox became reflective, recalling Navy days when, he said, he learned the blood of all Americans runs red. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re all too wrapped up in our differences to see our similarities,\u201d he told me. \u201cI say to Liberals, let\u2019s try to find things we can agree on.\u201dIt seemed a genuine Coloradan sentiment.The race for Hickenlooper\u2019s successor as governor pits Walker Stapleton, the Republican state treasurer, against Jared Polis, a five-term Democratic congressman from Boulder who made a fortune in online start-ups. A recent poll from the American Politics Research Lab in Boulder shows Polis leading Stapleton, 54 percent to 42 percent.Polis seems to be gaining most traction through his bold proposals for universal full-day preschool, powering Colorado\u2019s energy grid 100 percent from renewables by 2040 and ending what, in an interview, he called the \u201cbig health care rip off,\u201d perhaps through a single-payer system.Anger at Trump and the erosion of middle-class life seems to have reinforced a progressive mood among Coloradans. This is suggested by strong support for Amendment 73, a state constitutional amendment that would raise taxes on individuals earning over $150,000 and corporations to increase public school spending. Seth Cagin is one of these mobilized Coloradans. A retired publisher in Telluride, he has knocked on several thousand doors in his campaign as a Democratic candidate for the State House. He\u2019d never run for office before Trump came along. His is an uphill struggle in generally conservative counties, including Montrose. But Cagin finds that wedge issues like guns, immigration and abortion tend to obscure the fact that many Coloradans of whatever political persuasion want the same things: affordable health care, better schools, higher wages and protection of Colorado\u2019s public lands and water. They want a chance at a middle class life in a decent environment. Yet, as Cagin told me, \u201cOne thing every single Trump supporter knows as soon as you start to talk to them is that we think they\u2019re dumb and look down on them.\u201d Democrats, he suggested, might reflect on that.Don Colcord, a pharmacist and one of the rare Democrats in Nucla, also believes that the party needs to stop alienating small-town America. Environmental concerns are worthy, but what happens when, as in Nucla, they lead to the imminent shutdown of a coal-fired power plant with the loss of dozens of jobs and the tax base that pays for schools? \u201cIt\u2019s a sacrificial cow to the environmental movement,\u201d he said.While I was in Nucla, I went to the funeral service at the First Baptist Church for Lacie Redd, a 34-year-old divorced mother of two girls who had just committed suicide by shooting herself.Redd\u2019s mother, Glenna Nix, worked at Colcord\u2019s pharmacy. He knows the family. Redd suffered from seizures; her prescription medicine was wildly expensive. \u201cThirty tablets cost more than $1,000, and she needed more than one a day, and she was fighting and fighting to get insurance to cover it, and sometimes she\u2019d run out,\u201d Colcord recalled. In the end, it was too much for Redd \u2014 caring for her girls, coping with seizures, getting her medicine, just plain surviving.\u201cThere are a lot of wonderful things about free enterprise,\u201d Colcord reflected. \u201cAnd a lot of devastating things, too. Good-old America. Yeah, good-old America.\u201dAmerica cannot find enduring solutions to big problems like health care one party at a time. But Washington has lost the capacity for negotiated outcomes. Trump\u2019s Republicans are all about slash-and-burn. As Senator Bennet told me: \u201cWe can\u2019t get anything of importance done. When was the last time you heard a politician say I only got 65 percent of what I wanted but here is why I think we should do it?\u201dAgainst this backdrop of paralysis, Colorado has done better. The grandeur of its beauty and space seem to stir some nobler instinct in the name of preserving nature and advancing the common good. It\u2019s impossible to drive across the state and not be reminded of the first boundlessness of American potential. People disagree; they are not, however, disagreeable.\u201cThe West is the most collaborative place,\u201d Hickenlooper told me. \u201cIt\u2019s still the place where people can come and be defined by how big their dream is and how hard they are willing to work.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Stocks Became Expensive. Are Other Countries Better Bets?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 6.7 percent decline in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in six trading sessions through Thursday nearly erased the 7.2 percent gain the index recorded in the third quarter. The market rebounded a bit on Friday. But even before the six-day plunge, the narrowness of the quarter\u2019s advance hinted that the market was on shakier ground than the peak reached in the period might have suggested.The strong performance during the quarter was concentrated in American stocks, primarily of a handful of big-name technology companies, such as Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Markets fell almost everywhere else.The gap between stock returns in the United States and elsewhere has led some \u2014 but definitely not all \u2014 strategists to conclude that for American investors, there are better prospects abroad.\u201cThe U.S. is an expensive, frothy market priced to give you terrible forward returns,\u201d said Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, who is seeking opportunities in foreign markets.On the other hand, Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said the outperformance of the American market was justified \u2014 and may well continue. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world, and between the U.S. market and the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest of the developed world has half as much growth, and it\u2019s the same with profits. It\u2019s a legitimate divergence. It\u2019s not solely a matter of sentiment.\u201dLegitimate or not, the divergence between foreign and domestic markets \u2014 and how much they cost \u2014 accelerated in recent months. The Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-U.S. exchange-traded fund was down 4.9 percent in the year through September, while the SPDR S.&P. 500 E.T.F. rose 8.9 percent, helped by a 7.2 percent increase in the underlying index in the third quarter. Based on the ratio of share prices to book value, American stocks were more than twice as expensive in September as stocks in the rest of the world, according to Bank of America, a record premium.Leading the laggards downward were emerging markets, several of which have plunged because of heavy amounts of foreign debt, and Europe, where indexes are heavily weighted in banks that are owed a lot of that money.The comparative strength of domestic stocks has been justified by the superior performance of the American economy and the presence of so many high-quality, high-growth companies, investment advisers like Mr. Golub say. Others, like Mr. Arnott, counter that American business prospects cannot be marvelous enough to justify such a cavernous valuation discrepancy, especially over the medium-to-long haul. Foreign markets, especially in the developing world, are bound to bounce back and reward the patience of investors who take a chance on them, they say.Mr. Arnott, for example, highlighted an array of measures showing that American stocks are expensive when compared with their own history or with foreign alternatives, especially in the developing world.\u201cEmerging market stocks are cheap,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been whacked because of fears that a trade war will do these economies great damage.\u201d With valuations at half the levels of American stocks\u2019, he said, \u201cthey\u2019re reflecting the worst case, not the most likely case.\u201dBonds issued in the developing world also offer good value, in his view. Debt denominated in local currencies yields 6 percent or more, double what long-term Treasury issues offer.Yet emerging market assets may not seem like bargains to anyone familiar with the currency collapses and economic difficulties besetting countries like Turkey and Argentina. Lower stock prices or an extra three or four points of yield may be small compensation for the possibility of further currency losses or the added risk of default.But those countries account for a minuscule fraction of emerging stock and bond markets. Other places are on more solid economic and financial footing, although it might take a while before recognition sets in that they\u2019re still moving in the right direction.\u201cThe emerging market story is intact, but you have to have a longer-term focus; emerging markets are still not for the faint of heart,\u201d said Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants. \u201cThe best bets in these markets continue to be the ones growing strongly.\u201dStrong, persistent economic growth, propelled in part by young, rising populations, can overcome occasional bouts of weakness in mature economies, policy errors at home, large foreign debts and other unfavorable conditions, she said.Indonesia, for instance, one of her favorite markets, runs large fiscal and current-account deficits, Ms. Morrissey said. The country owes a lot of money to foreign lenders, and its currency, the rupiah, is trading near where it was during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, but economic growth is at a five-year high.India, another favorite, also runs large deficits and has a weak currency. On top of that, India is \u201cmassively oil reliant,\u201d she said. But its economy grew at an 8.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, driven by the country\u2019s dynamic private sector.\u201cThere are still significant portions of the populations in these countries striving for an iPhone,\u201d Ms. Morrissey said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a significant growth story.\u201dThe arguments for investing in the United States are strong, too. Measures of consumer and business sentiment are close to all-time highs. The September reading of the Conference Board index of consumer confidence, for example, was the highest since 2000.Highlights of mutual fund performance in the third quarter.Leaders and LaggardsStocks vs. BondsAmong general domestic stock funds.Average returns, by fund category.12 MONTHS3RD QTR.LEADERS12 MONTHS3RD QTR.++++15.20.42.10.8%+++\u20135.40.70.10.1%General stock fundsAlger SmallCap Focus++++++++51.829.548.935.730.957.747.936.5%++++++++16.416.315.213.813.813.613.113.0%Taxable bondsQuantified STFInvestorInternational stocksVirtus Zeven.InnovativeMunicipal bondsBaron DiscoveryInstl.Growth vs. ValueCongress SmallCap GrowthReturns in the third quarter.GrowthBlendValueDelaware SmidCap Growth+8%Morgan StanleyInst.

American stock indexes are heavily weighted toward technology companies, while European indexes have a larger proportion of banks, which have been struggling in part because of their extensive exposure to lenders in the developing world.Fund returns in the third quarter confirmed the outperformance but not by as much as you might expect from the moves in the underlying assets. The average domestic stock fund rose 5 percent, according to Morningstar, led by portfolios specializing in health care, energy and technology. The average international fund gained 0.1 percent, depressed by losses in India and China funds.The average taxable bond fund returned 0.7 percent in the period.Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, also finds the discrepancy in investment returns justified.\u201cThe U.S. leadership this year is a reflection of diverging fundamentals in different parts of the world,\u201d she said. \u201cSignificant stimulus\u201d \u2014 from the Federal Reserve until recently and then from a big round of tax cuts \u2014 \u201chas helped lift corporate earnings. I\u2019m not surprised that the U.S. is outperforming by so much this year. I guess the question is: Can the outperformance last?\u201dIt\u2019s a tough one to answer in a world of interconnected economies. Some developments that would worsen conditions at home might cause even greater damage abroad, Ms. Patterson said, while favorable domestic developments might provide a greater lift elsewhere.If the Fed has second thoughts about monetary tightening and turns more dovish, for instance, it could depress the dollar, easing pressures on foreign economies with large debts denominated in dollars. \u201cThe rest of the world could catch up,\u201d she said.By contrast, an acceleration of the slow-motion trade war that has been worrying investors all year \u2014 although not enough to put much of a crimp in market returns \u2014 would hurt the domestic economy, but it could damp growth to a much greater extent in places like China, she said. A slowdown in China, in turn, would have a more serious impact on Europe than the United States.Another potential impediment to European markets, Ms. Patterson said, is the imminent start of a monetary tightening cycle by the European Central Bank. The Fed has been far more hawkish on inflation, but its European counterpart may soon join it in raising interest rates and selling assets acquired in its quantitative easing program.With such prospects, she prefers to maintain a particularly high allocation to domestic stocks. But favorable moves on the trade front would persuade her to put more into emerging markets, particularly China.Mr. Golub contends that investors have \u201calmost an obsession with what could go wrong\u201d for American stocks, although he acknowledged that \u201cif people were really cautious, the market wouldn\u2019t be going up\u201d as it did in the third quarter.He also highlighted a number of factors that are \u201ca risk but not a problem,\u201d including inflation, the elections next month and the trade backdrop. He said that valuations are not cheap and that long-term returns could suffer for that.\u201cThere is an unbelievable number of potential threats to the stock market, but none of them are derailing the market yet,\u201d Mr. Golub said.The last word in that quote might worry some investors, especially lately, but he recommends owning some of the highest of fliers, including technology stocks that focus on consumer services, such as Priceline and Amazon, and on communication services, including Netflix, Alphabet and Facebook. He also favors financial companies.If there are risks but not problems in the United States, as Mr. Golub put it, Nick Kaiser, manager of the Sextant International fund, finds problems but not as much risk overseas.\u201cThere are more opportunities in foreign markets than domestic,\u201d Mr. Kaiser said. Even a country like Argentina \u201cis a great place to invest,\u201d he said, as long as the money is put to work in stocks when they trade at low valuations, and not bonds, which are far more susceptible to inflation.His strategy is to look for high-quality companies, even if the quality of the economy in places where they do business may be suspect. An example in Argentina is MercadoLibre, an online retailer that operates across South America.Other portfolio holdings that Mr. Kaiser mentioned include Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, a French engineering company; Nice, an Israeli cybersecurity concern; and two Dutch businesses: the consumer electronics company Philips, and ASML Holding, a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\u201cWe see a lot of opportunities in Europe,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there may be more in Argentina and Brazil.\u201dMr. Arnott likewise sees a world full of healthy investment prospects. He finds it easier to list what he would avoid than what he would buy.\u201cThere\u2019s a richer spread of opportunity than usual, just not in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just need a little upside surprise and you\u2019ve got a bull market.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Nearly 2,200 students answered. \u201cWhat can you show us from your own life, or the lives of those around you, that might help make the portrait of \u2018Gen Z\u2019 more interesting, nuanced, complete or real?\u201d we asked. Nearly 2,200 students answered. They showed us teenagers in cars, in classrooms, at parties, in swimming pools, on playing fields and in their beds; teenagers with their dogs, their moms, their friends, their homework, their makeup, their video games and their prom dates; teenagers running, jumping, studying, singing, vaping, taking selfies, protesting and kissing. But the thing they showed us most often \u2014 by our count, in over 70 percent of the images we received \u2014 was teenagers with their phones. In their statements, our participants variously described the devices as their friends and their family, their enemies and their addiction. Some said adults could never understand such a complex relationship. Others pointed out that adults were just as dependent.  My generation is believed to have abandoned the old ways. We are the first to grow up on Snapchat and Instagram, but while increased technology has shifted many aspects of our lives, it has not caused us to discard the traditions of our ancestors. In my photograph, a teenage girl is lighting a votive candle in a church.This girl is invisible to the world around her, just like how the issue of mental illness is sometimes invisible to adults and the older generation.I believe many teenagers in China are tired of hearing this. We were born under the \u201cOne Child Policy\u201d in China, so as the only child in an extended family, we naturally become the focus. However, being the focus brings overwhelming expectations and pressure. We are expected to stand out, but not everyone can be the winner under such a competitive system. The admission rate of enrolling in a Chinese top-tier college like Fudan University is about 1.37 percent. Aimless. Entitled. Queer. Depressed. This is all the world sees of Gen Z, or iGen. Sure, every generation is ridiculed by the previous one, but for iGen it\u2019s different. We carry the nagging voices of our parents, as well as their mistakes. Growing up in a failing economy (and after the recession), we\u2019ve become more responsible with money, not asking for it unless it\u2019s necessary. We spend our days not hunched over our stereotypical phones, but over our textbooks. My life revolves around school and my future. Our lives are polluted with the high expectations \u2014 conscious or not \u2014 of everyone around us. High-stakes tests and the Common Core have molded us into robots. Despite all of these and more, many of us intend to make this generation the greatest.These two boys are my little brothers. Andres is 14 and Angel is 3, and Angel looks up to Andres so much. This was taken on the football field after my brother\u2019s game. You can see the connection between the two clearly, Angel looking up to Andres and Andres acknowledging it proudly because he knows he became a good role model for him to follow.Many people see innocence as a period of time in one\u2019s life that typically expires during adolescence. As we grow up we lose our playfulness, our memories, our ability to think independently and creatively. We are supposed to experiment, we are supposed to be competitive, we are supposed to grow. What if, through this awkward lane change, we hold on to our innocence, our memories, our personality?This photo is about Andrew, a skateboarder from Los Angeles who, I believe, has held on to his childhood. Andrew is 16 years old living in a time where most people his age try their best to act older, act hard, act big, like a grown-up. He is still playful, still young, still innocent. As others grow new connections, Andrew\u2019s childlike personality prevents others from associating with him. It tarnishes their \u201cexperimental\u201d image. It cramps their style.Two years prior to taking this, I was recruited to the Syracuse High cross country team as a 13-year-old.

She told me that every day after practice, she and her friends would sit in the locker and just talk about their day, and that even though something like that seemed so simple, it was the highlight of her day.

I never will.\u201d I believe there is a part of each of us that we either intentionally, or unintentionally, don\u2019t reveal to elders, and parents specifically.We are not lazy but tired. Tired of how we are portrayed and treated by others. Like self-absorbed children who don\u2019t understand how the world works. Older generations, including our parents and grandparents, are unaware of what goes on behind the scenes of teenage life and only see the moments of rest.

{"Headline": "Theresa May Plays for Time on Brexit, Amid Talk of an Extension", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 British Prime Minister Theresa May tried Wednesday to salvage talks on her country\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, appealing for time to avert a messy and economically damaging departure without an agreement and hinting that it might take longer than expected to fully pull away from the bloc.At a European summit meeting in Brussels that began on Wednesday, Mrs. May and other European leaders discussed for the first time the possibility of prolonging Britain\u2019s proposed 20-month transition after a March exit, the \u201cstandstill\u201d period during which very little would change.Some of Mrs. May\u2019s European counterparts are becoming increasingly frustrated with talks over Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the bloc, known as \u201cBrexit.\u201d Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite told reporters not to expect a breakthrough on Wednesday because the British side had still failed to explain clearly how it wanted to leave the European Union.\u201cToday we do not know what they want,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do not know themselves what they really want. That is the problem.\u201dSince Britons voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the European Union, their divided government has struggled to define a negotiating position that reconciles conflicting objectives. While some want to keep close economic ties to the bloc to protect the economy, others would prefer a cleaner break and some hard-line pro-Brexit members of Mrs. May\u2019s cabinet may be on the brink of resignation.Talks broke down on Sunday, halting discussions over Brexit that many had hoped would reach a climax at the Brussels summit meeting. On Wednesday, Mrs. May was battling to save the negotiations and keep channels of communication open. She addressed the other leaders ahead of a dinner, insisting that a deal was possible before leaving them to their meal and their own discussion about the way ahead.A summit meeting that had been penciled in for November to finalize a Brexit agreement is now unlikely to take place and most diplomats expect any deal will have to wait until December.The big sticking point in the negotiations is the Irish border. On Wednesday, Mrs. May restated her commitment to ensuring that, whatever happens in talks on future trade ties between Britain and the European Union, there will be no need for new customs and other checks on goods at the frontier between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, which will remain in the European Union.Given the difficulty of untying the knotty issue of how to manage a frictionless border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, most diplomats now expect that an agreement is unlikely before December. The European Union negotiator, Michel Barnier, called for calm discussions but said: \u201cWe need much more time.\u201dThe prospects of a disorderly British departure \u2014 with potentially profound economic consequences \u2014 have grown in recent days. But if Mrs. May can keep negotiations going, it may help her to postpone the ultimate decisions \u2014 some likely to be politically painful compromises \u2014 until later.Without a majority in Parliament, Mrs. May is a weak prime minister at the head of a divided cabinet who has been doing her best to postpone serious choices about how to resolve the Irish border problem and about a future relationship with Brussels. She fears that too definitive a policy now would bring down her government.Her tactic has often seemed to be to delay as long as possible in the hopes that, faced with a real deadline for Brexit, her cabinet and Parliament would support a withdrawal deal, however unsatisfactory, rather than risk the chaos of a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit.Though Mrs. May has often said that no deal is better than a bad deal, she is likely to argue down the road that no deal is worse than a not-so-terrible deal.The potential disruption that could accompany a no-deal scenario was underscored on Wednesday when the French government published some of its contingency planning for a British departure without a deal. That could mean Britons needing visas to visit France, the document suggested.One British idea to break the deadlock is for the whole of the United Kingdom to remain inside a customs union until there is a plan in place for future trade that would obviate the need for checks. But Mrs. May\u2019s pro-Brexit hard-liners fear that their country could be trapped indefinitely in a customs union and want a time limit on this plan.Some Europeans worry that the proposal would also allow Britain a competitive advantage.Extending the post-Brexit transition period, perhaps by another year, would give more time to negotiate the details of Britain\u2019s future relationship with the bloc. But that would not please those in Britain, including members of Mrs. May\u2019s own cabinet, who want a cleaner, faster break with Brussels.The Irish foreign minister, Simon Coveney, said that the European Union would be willing to extend a transition period but insisted that Britain must not renege on previous agreements to prevent a hard border in Ireland.Ahead of the meeting Mrs. May said that \u201ceverybody around the table\u201d wanted an agreement for an orderly British withdrawal, and \u201cby working intensively over the next days and weeks I believe we can achieve a deal.\u201dSpeaking after her talk to the other leaders, the head of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, said that \u201cI did not perceive anything substantially new in terms of content as I listened to Mrs. May. The tone was of someone who wanted to reach an agreement. But there\u2019s no change in content.\u201dThere was better news for Mrs. May from the United States. In what was presumably intended to bolster Mrs. May, the Trump administration announced that it would initiate trade negotiations with Britain \u2014 but only after it leaves the European Union at the end of March 2019.While talks can take place, Britain would not be able to sign any trade deal with another country until after the transition period of nearly two years, if not longer, while it negotiates its own future relationship with the European Union.As currently understood, that transition period would last until at least the end of 2020, though it might be extended until the end of 2021. During that time Britain would follow the rules of the European Union even if it is not formally a member, and would continue to pay into the bloc\u2019s budget.Freedom to do its own trade deals is an important plank of the government\u2019s interpretation of Brexit. But if Britain and Brussels in the end choose to negotiate a customs union for the future, Britain would remain unable to do its own trade deals separate from those negotiated by the European Union.The Trump administration simultaneously informed Congress that it also intended to negotiate trade deals with the European Union and Japan, beginning within 90 days.Christopher Schuetze contributed reporting from Berlin.Advertisement"}

He was, after all, one of China\u2019s own leading law enforcement officials, who rose to that rank while Mr. Xi already was China\u2019s president and who was then sent to represent the country as the head of the world\u2019s top law enforcement organization. Is the Chinese government now saying it made a mistake in backing him? Isn\u2019t that a huge loss of face?The answer is no.But then comes the more pragmatic question: Won\u2019t the Meng incident jeopardize China\u2019s chances of placing more of its people at the head of international bodies in the future? The C.C.P. could have lured him back to China and packed him off under some pretext like poor health while silencing the rest of his family.Mr. Xi may have assessed \u2014 and if so, quite correctly, I think \u2014 that given the souring of relations between China and the United States, in the future Beijing won\u2019t have as many opportunities as before to see Chinese people lead major world organizations. That being so, riding roughshod over Mr. Meng wasn\u2019t costly internationally \u2014 on the other hand, it could cause shock and awe among Mr. Xi\u2019s domestic opponents.The Nixon-Kissinger-Clinton thesis \u2014 that helping China develop its economy would bring about a middle class that would then push the country to democratize and become a responsible stakeholder internationally \u2014 is now widely recognized as wishful thinking.

Jacky, I\u2019ll stack my record up against yours any day.\u201d The commercial closes with another shot of the tube man.It is true that Mr. Heller has advanced more pieces of health legislation in the last Congress than his opponent.

{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s New Leader, Once a Nafta Foe, Welcomes New Deal", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s incoming president, the leftist Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, once railed against free-market policies and harbored deep misgivings about the North American Free Trade Agreement.But hours after Canada joined an agreement between Mexico and the United States to revamp the 24-year-old trade deal, the president-elect and his aides on Monday hailed the last-minute negotiations that salvaged the trilateral accord.\u201cTo us, the agreement looks to be very good for Mexico,\u201d said Jes\u00fas Seade, who represented Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador on the Mexican negotiating team.Both Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, Mexico\u2019s president-elect, and the center-right Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, its president, welcomed news of the agreement, glossing over the fact that it included Mexican concessions \u2014 particularly in the auto industry, a key concern for President Trump.Instead they pointed to the stability the deal ensured and to the removal of a burden that had been hanging over the country\u2019s economy since Mr. Trump\u2019s election.The American president had called Nafta the worst trade deal in history and threatened to renegotiate it or withdraw. As the talks dragged on for months and stalled earlier this year, the risk that the accord could fall apart cast deep uncertainty over Mexico\u2019s economic outlook.\u201cThe culmination of this negotiation process promotes certainty in the financial markets and investment and job creation in our country,\u201d Marcelo Ebrard, who will be Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s foreign minister, said in a statement Monday morning.The three leaders have 60 days to sign the deal, whose timing was welcome for both the incoming and the outgoing presidents of Mexico.For Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, it is a win he can claim as part of his legacy. For Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, it means the process will close before his Dec. 1 inauguration. That frees him from messy negotiations at the start of his administration and allows him to turn his attention to Mexico\u2019s limping economy.Since Nafta went into effect almost a quarter century ago, it has created a booming export economy driven by foreign investors who built factories across central and northern Mexico to supply the North American market. Last year, Mexico exported almost $410 billion worth of goods, more than 80 percent of that to the United States and Canada.[Alan Rappeport, a Times reporter, answered questions about the new trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.]But at the same time, Nafta displaced millions of small farmers and local manufacturers. Successive governments have failed to come up with development policies to reincorporate them and stimulate the rest of Mexico\u2019s economy.The result is that overall poverty rates have barely budged in Mexico under Nafta and economic growth per capita has lagged behind almost every other country in Latin America \u2014 just 1.2 percent on average from 1996 to 2015, according to Santiago Levy, a Mexican economist who is vice president at the Inter-American Development Bank.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, a former mayor of Mexico City, campaigned on restoring the forgotten sectors of the economy, particularly in Mexico\u2019s underdeveloped south. Although he was once a fiery opponent of Mexico\u2019s market reforms, he has changed his rhetoric against free trade, arguing instead that Nafta should be improved to benefit Mexicans, rather than overturned.Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center of the Baker Institute at Rice University, said the president-elect\u2019s embrace of the trade deal revealed his realistic approach to governing.\u201cI think that most of us were always aware that there were two personalities to Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador,\u201d Mr. Payan said. \u201cOne was an ideologue, a populist, thunder-and-lightning politician that was a critic of neoliberalism and the mafia in power.\u201d\u201cBut when you look at his record as mayor,\u201d Mr. Payan said, \u201che was quite pragmatic.\u201dMexico\u2019s Senate, which fell under the control of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s party in this year\u2019s elections, must still approve the revamped deal, which is being called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or U.S.M.C.A. That vote is likely to move smoothly.\u201cAlready there is a sign that he will instruct his political party to vote for this agreement,\u201d Mr. Payan said of Mexico\u2019s president-elect. \u201cThat is the pragmatic L\u00f3pez Obrador that understands that Mexico is dependent on the economic relationship with the United States.\u201dThe prudent approach to the new trade deal can help Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s economic team make the case to investors, who are wary of his populist promises that they will be good economic managers, said Christopher Wilson, the deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center in Washington.Still, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador clearly prefers for Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto to sign the deal before he leaves office, avoiding the appearance of owning a deal that many of his supporters dislike.\u201cThe next administration wants to turn the page on this,\u201d said Antonio Ortiz-Mena, a former Mexican trade official who is a senior vice president at Albright Stonebridge Group in Washington.For the deeply unpopular Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto, whose party was so soundly rejected by voters that it has little more than 10 percent of the seats in Congress, signing the accord allows him to leave behind a signature achievement.\u201cIt means that he leaves office having resolved the big threats that came from Trump,\u201d Mr. Wilson said.It also provides Mr. Pe\u00f1a Nieto with vindication for what many considered an unforgivable foreign policy decision: inviting Mr. Trump to Mexico in August 2016 during the campaign despite the invectives the Republican candidate hurled at Mexicans during his rallies.\u201cThey made the bet that building a strong personal relationship with Trump and his team would pay off,\u201d Mr. Wilson said. \u201cThis in some way vindicates that bet.\u201dAnalysts are still parsing the details of the 500-page accord, but Mexico made important concessions. These include a requirement that to qualify for tariff reduction, a car must have 30 percent of the work done on it by workers earning at least $16 an hour beginning in 2020. That\u2019s considerably higher than what a typical Mexican autoworker earns. That requirement will gradually move up to 40 percent by 2023.Mexico also won an exemption on any future tariffs the Trump administration is threatening against auto imports of up to 2.6 million cars \u2014 well above the number that Mexico currently sends to the United States.\u201cThe existing industry is protected,\u201d said Luis de la Calle, a former Mexican trade negotiator, adding that trade deals with Europe, South America and parts of Asia under the Trans-Pacific Partnership mean that \u201cMexico is still an attractive place to invest.\u201dFor its part, the United States dropped a demand for restrictions on Mexican fresh produce exports and agreed to a rolling review of the accord, rather than its earlier insistence that the agreement expire after five years unless the three countries agreed to renew it.Mexico also managed to preserve parts of a dispute settlement provision that the United States had tried to eliminate, arguing that it amounted to an assurance for investors who were taking jobs to Mexico.Mr. Payan said the final accord produced an unwieldy set of compromises among the three countries.\u201cI think Trump thought that Canada and Mexico would be pushovers and they dug in their heels on certain things,\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article referred imprecisely to Canada\u2019s leadership. Canada has a prime minister, not a president.Advertisement"}

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.A big irony of the final stages of these midterms is that after all of the special elections, domestic and foreign policy crises, and general craziness out of Washington over the past nine months, the fundamentals of this race look pretty much like they did at the beginning of the year.That\u2019s good news for Republicans, who spent much of the summer worried that they could face a blowout in the House and maybe even the Senate. For the G.O.P., boring is ideal.Republicans today feel confident about the Senate, a fight that\u2019s largely happening on red-state turf. Democrats are optimistic about the House, but their expectations have tempered a bit from a few months ago, when they thought their party could rack up dozens of victories.

Honestly: Expect surprises.____________________President Trump is headed to Wisconsin on Wednesday, and that\u2019s seen as a boost to Leah Vukmir, the Republican who is trying to take on Senator Tammy Baldwin but has trailed in polls. The rally is set for an airport hangar in Mosinee, two hours north of Madison, in a section of the state where Mr. Trump is popular.Gov. Scott Walker, the Republican who\u2019s in a tough fight for a third term, will also be in attendance. And some strategists say the Trump rally will fire up the Republican base in northern Wisconsin and help push Mr. Walker past Tony Evers, the state schools superintendent and Democratic candidate who has come up nearly even with Mr. Walker in polls.But there are others who wonder whether Mr. Walker might be better off if Mr. Trump stayed home.Mr. Walker, who has carved out his own clear tax-cutting, union-shrinking identity over eight years, has largely cast the race as a Wisconsin-centric fight, not part of Washington\u2019s political battle. For months, Mr. Walker has been one of the loudest voices warning of the possibility of a blue wave, and just as Trump fans in central and northern Wisconsin may be energized by hearing from the president, there\u2019s a risk for Mr. Walker that Democrats in Milwaukee and Madison, who were appalled and stunned that Wisconsin went for Trump in 2016, will be further riled up by the president\u2019s presence in the state \u2014 and motivated to go vote.In case that wasn\u2019t enough motivation, former President Barack Obama comes to the state on Friday.____________________You can see all our polling here._________________________________________________________________________________Isabella Grull\u00f3n Paz and Margaret Kramer contributed to this newsletter.Thanks for reading.

{"Headline": "Treason Trial for Pakistani Journalist Signals New Pressure on Media", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA prominent Pakistani journalist has been ordered to face a court hearing on accusations of treason next week, in a case the country\u2019s press corps says is one of several recent attempts under the new government to intimidate the news media into silence.In the interview, Mr. Sharif appeared to reinforce India\u2019s accusation that Pakistan\u2019s military aided the militants who carried out the 2008 Mumbai attacks, which killed more than 160 locals and foreign tourists.On Tuesday, journalists, editors and other civil society groups will stage a demonstration against the court\u2019s action against Mr. Almeida and what they say is pressure on media organizations to stifle criticism of the government and military.\u201cThis is the darkest period for journalism in the country\u2019s history, no doubt about it,\u201d said Afzal Butt, president of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists.In the months before the election, several journalists were beaten or abducted, with only one thread tying them together: their criticism of the military.In June, the columnist and political commentator Gul Bukhari was abducted in an army-controlled area of Lahore by unknown attackers, including men in military uniform. And Dawn, which Mr. Almeida works for, was prevented from being distributed in military cantonments, which make up large residential areas of most Pakistani cities.Mr. Almeida and the editors at Dawn declined to comment for this article, citing the coming trial.But in the same breath, Mr. Khan insisted that the news media was free.\u201cPakistan\u2019s media is one of the most vibrant medias in the world,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cWatch the programs every evening. There are 10 current affairs programs going on; everyone expresses their views.\u201dMany journalists and editors say the current hostility is more dangerous than pressure seen under previous governments: They see it as coming from all pillars of the state, with Mr. Khan\u2019s government considered closely in sync with the courts and the military. The military is accused of pressuring the courts to block any opposition \u2014 or even criticism \u2014 of Pakistan\u2019s powerful army, and military pressure was seen as a factor in the court\u2019s ruling last year removing Mr. Sharif from office on corruption charges.Editors and publishers fear that the Content Committee may favor media outlets deemed to be supportive of Mr. Khan\u2019s government while indirectly punishing those that are critical by withholding needed advertising.\u201cWe have to wait and see if this is a monitoring body to favor some groups and curtail advertisement for others that in the past or present were critical to government,\u201d said Mazhar Abbas, the former secretary general of Pakistan\u2019s journalist union.\u201cThe tactics are now different, to financially cripple strong media houses, unlike before where they may ban a newspaper for some time. By crippling the media houses, newspapers are curbing their reporting, reducing their pages,\u201d Mr. Abbas added.But Mr. Abbas and others say Mr. Almeida\u2019s case is unique because his treason charges stem directly from an interview he conducted.\u201cIf an interview is now a crime, how can we do our jobs?\u201d Mr. Abbas asked.This month, the Ministry of Information started a Twitter account called Fake News Buster, supposedly to debunk social media rumors. The move was a chilling reminder of the army\u2019s warning to journalists before the election that their social media accounts were being monitored, hinting that they would be punished for any posts that were unfavorable to Pakistan.\u201cThis seems to be a well-thought, sinister move on the part of both government and military to remodel and regulate the country\u2019s print and electronic media industry to strengthen the military\u2019s narrative about politics and the economy at the cost of constitutionally guaranteed freedoms,\u201d said Matiullah Jan, a prominent talk show host.The tendency of officials to \u201cpaint critics as anti-state and traitors is pressurizing and endangering the lives of journalists,\u201d Mr. Jan added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Rare Court Ruling Allowed the Drug Maker Fresenius to Nix a $4.75 Billion Deal", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsMerger escape clauses are notoriously hard to trigger, but a judge has allowed Germany\u2019s Fresenius to nix its $4.75 billion deal to acquire the fellow drug maker Akorn.Don\u2019t expect many copycats. The case included misconduct claims, but even so it may be overturned: Corporate-friendly Delaware courts are loath to second-guess contracts.The American generic-drug maker Akorn went into a tailspin after Fresenius agreed to buy it in early 2017. Akorn had predicted annual revenue of more than $1 billion and nearly $350 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. By the end of the year, the firm had chalked up $841 million of sales, and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization fell 80 percent below its projection.What mattered was the root of this shortfall. Fresenius claimed that Akorn made misrepresentations when it claimed to be in compliance with Food and Drug Administration regulations and making progress in fixing manufacturing shortfalls. In particular, Fresenius said that Akorn had been sloppy with \u2014 or, worse, fabricated \u2014 the data that underlies F.D.A. drug approvals.The judge agreed. He stated that Akorn\u2019s representations were not \u201ctrue and correct, and the magnitude of the inaccuracies would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.\u201d Fresenius was free to walk away, and the news sent Akorn shares tumbling more than 50 percent.Lawyers can no longer say that Delaware has never allowed a material adverse change clause to invalidate a deal \u2014 but in practice it\u2019s doubtful that much has changed.Bad results aren\u2019t sufficient to let companies wriggle out of deals. The economy is cyclical, some industries more so, and rivals may introduce superior technology that renders a company worthless. These are not good reasons to invalidate a contract. Judge Travis Laster decided that it was the combination of multiple serious misrepresentations and an adverse change in Akorn\u2019s business that allowed Fresenius to exit. Akorn is appealing, and the verdict may yet be overturned.Delaware has become the most popular place for big American companies to incorporate for a reason. The law is favorable to them, justice moves relatively quickly in specialized cases, and contracts are upheld. The courts will probably prefer to keep a high bar when it comes to invalidating deals.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Still Dreams of Taking Its Oil Company Public", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor now, Saudi Aramco will remain private. And while the kingdom has turned to a patchwork of other solutions to replace the proceeds from the stock sale, its ambitions may have to wait.Referring to Prince Mohammed, he added, \u201cI think he got ahead of himself.\u201dBringing Saudi Aramco to the public markets was always going to be a gargantuan task. Founded in 1933, it is the world\u2019s biggest petroleum producer, overseeing the two largest oil fields ever discovered. It claimed last year to have reserves equivalent to nearly 333 billion barrels of oil; by comparison, Exxon Mobil said it had 21.2 billion.Profits from that oil empire have underpinned the Saudi economy for decades. But Prince Mohammed wanted to wean the kingdom off its dependence on oil, particularly as consumers around the world move toward renewable sources of energy.To do that, he settled on selling a fraction of Saudi Aramco\u2019s stock on the public markets and transferring ownership the company to the kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, instantly making it one of the biggest in the world. Given the Saudi\u2019s belief that Saudi Aramco could be valued at $2 trillion in an I.P.O., selling just 5 percent of its shares would raise an astounding $100 billion.Saudi officials also agreed to work with SoftBank on what they said would be the world\u2019s biggest solar-power project, harnessing the country\u2019s abundant sunshine.But as Prince Mohammed\u2019s aspirations grew, the Saudi Aramco initial offering faced a number of thorny issues.Oil industry executives said Prince Mohammed\u2019s proposed $2 trillion market value was too high. That meant the kingdom might raise far less money than initially hoped.Taking Saudi Aramco public also would subject the company to far greater scrutiny and shed more light into the financial health of the kingdom. That could have reduced the Saudi government\u2019s leverage over trading partners.Oil prices also have risen \u2014 from below $30 a barrel when Prince Mohammed first floated the idea of an I.P.O. to well over $80 a barrel now \u2014 reducing the need for such a stock sale.Kingdom officials insist that the oil giant will go public, just not on the previously announced schedule.Saudi Aramco may yet sell a stake in itself. The oil producer could take on a strategic investor, with analysts pointing to huge Chinese industrial customers as potential candidates.All told, the kingdom could raise as much money through these efforts as it could have through a Saudi Aramco public offering. And perhaps it will complete all the world-transforming projects that it has proposed. But all that is less certain now than it was before.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pence\u2019s China Speech Seen as Portent of \u2018New Cold War\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPublicly, China responded with a certain weariness, calling the speech \u201cvery ridiculous,\u201d creating \u201csomething out of thin air,\u201d but also warning that \u201cno one can stop\u201d the Chinese people from advancing.The leaders were no doubt angry and embarrassed that the Trump administration went all-out publicly with confrontational language that is considered unacceptable in Chinese culture, which prefers sweet phrases to disguise stern measures.Some of Mr. Pence\u2019s declarations, like saying Washington\u2019s trade policy most likely caused a 25 percent fall in China\u2019s largest stock exchange in the first nine months of this year, could be dismissed as inaccurate, since trade tensions were one of several factors. Similarly, the claim that the United States \u201crebuilt China\u201d over the last 25 years could be shrugged off as dubious and unfair.But it was unmistakably clear that the era of Washington holding out a hand to Beijing to become a \u201cresponsible stakeholder\u201d in world affairs alongside the United States \u2014 a phrase used in 2005 by Robert B. Zoellick, then the deputy secretary of state \u2014 was over.\u201cThis will look like the declaration of a new Cold War, and what China may do is more important than what it will say about Pence\u2019s speech,\u201d said Zhang Baohui, professor of international relations at Lingnan University in Hong Kong.China could respond by funneling more money toward its armed forces, which Mr. Pence said spend as much as all other militaries in Asia combined. (The International Institute for Strategic Studies said last year that Asian countries combined spent about 25 percent more than China on their militaries, and that the United States spent four times what China did on its armed forces.)China has kept its military budget at 1.5 percent of its economic output over the last few years. \u201cIt has a long way to go to reach the U.S. level of 3.5 to 4 percent,\u201d Mr. Zhang said.China could also reverse course on its support of the American-led effort in the United Nations that has imposed heavy sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs.Chinese policymakers, following Mr. Xi\u2019s strictures, are unlikely to give ground, said Yun Sun, a policy expert at the Stimson Center in Washington who is currently visiting China.\u201cMy comments to the Chinese are that maybe China should tone down its assertiveness to avoid further tension,\u201d Ms. Sun said of her discussions with Chinese officials. \u201cAnd the reaction I get is that \u2018We don\u2019t think we are being assertive.\u2019\u201dPresident Trump said last week that the friendship with Mr. Xi that he once was so proud of may now be over. The feeling was most likely reciprocated in the aftermath of the speech, Ms. Sun said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Xi still sees Trump as his friend.\u201dChina\u2019s social media platforms, which the government rigorously censors, eliminating provocative content, bristled in shock at the severity of Mr. Pence\u2019s speech.\u201cPence\u2019s speech is really earth-shattering,\u201d said one commenter. \u201cThis is the official speech of the U.S. I suggest every Chinese person read the whole thing. Is this another edition of the \u2018Iron Curtain\u2019 speech?\u201dMr. Pence\u2019s speech was clearly directed at a domestic audience. He gave it at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group, and its timing \u2014 11 p.m. in China \u2014 meant it probably had limited viewership in China, mostly among international affairs specialists. And it was given in the midst of a weeklong holiday in China, when the government\u2019s most strident megaphone for foreign policy, the state-run newspaper Global Times, is not publishing.Still, the unfavorable comparison with accusations of Russian interference in American politics probably alarmed Chinese officials, said Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former member of the National Security Council in the Obama administration.\u201cThe vice president attempted to shift public scrutiny from Russia to China,\u201d Mr. Hass said. \u201cHe asserted that Russian efforts to interfere in America\u2019s electoral process \u2018pales in comparison to what China is doing.\u2019\u201dBut the address could reassure two nations that fear China \u2014 Japan, an important American ally, and India, a country that Washington is trying to bring closer \u2014 regional analysts said. And the tougher approach reflects a growing wariness of China among American businesses.\u201cThis has been building for a long time across different sectors in the U.S. \u2014 the military and business in particular,\u201d said Bilahari Kausikan, a former foreign secretary for Singapore. \u201cAmerican business is particularly significant as it had been the stabilizing fact. But their mood has been souring for a decade or more. How the Chinese missed this, I do not know.\u201dIn Australia, another important American ally, the government has been saying many of the same things as Mr. Pence, though in more muted tones.In some ways, Australia has been viewed in Washington as a test case of what China could get away with in a country with a strong economy and Western values. The American and Australian intelligence agencies have consulted on what they see as the China threat.But the Australians have couched their new legislation in general terms, never singling out China.Mr. Pence\u2019s harder line is likely to ignite a debate in Australia about whether it, too, should take a harder line against China.\u201cLet\u2019s take the heat, light, noise and excitement out of the relationship by establishing a clear, declared policy that governs our approach to the economic and strategic relationship with the Chinese state,\u201d said Michael Shoebridge, director of defense at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Australia should follow in Mr. Pence\u2019s footsteps, he said.But there were concerns about pushing too far.\u201cI think Australia is broadly comfortable with the Pence approach,\u201d said Rory Medcalf, head of the National Security College at the Australian National University. \u201cThere is just a worry about it getting out of control.\u201dZoe Mou contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "\u2018Four Thousand Miles for the W\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "Not long ago, the Seattle Seahawks looked like a budding dynasty. With the franchise trying to rebuild on the fly, a trip to London came at the worst possible time. Or was it the best?The N.F.L. told the Seattle Seahawks last winter that they would face the Raiders in London on Oct. 14.Back then, months before the rest of the 2018 schedule came out, the Seahawks could never have anticipated that last weekend\u2019s trip to London would come at a pivotal juncture for the franchise: Their record stood at 2-3 after a tough loss to the Los Angeles Rams.Then it was time to spread the gospel of American football overseas. Instead of heading about 670 miles south to Oakland, Calif., the Seahawks would fly nearly 5,000 miles to England, eight time zones away.Sending an N.F.L. team overseas is a herculean venture. Players need passports, the equipment staff sends supplies months in advance, the travel director has to navigate an unfamiliar airport and hotel, and the trainers will often modify the players\u2019 diet and sleep regimens. Then there is the equipment, some 21,000 pounds of it, that must be transported.Maybe, with pressure mounting, a venture far away was exactly what this franchise needed.The Seahawks, who had a home game the Sunday before they left for London, practiced the next Tuesday and Wednesday, then left for London on Wednesday night, accompanied by a New York Times reporter and photographer.In the locker room, the mood was loose. Cornerback Neiko Thorpe challenged all comers in table tennis. At his locker, he had a Nintendo Switch gaming console that he was taking on the trip.\u201cHe was who he was, and I think that speaks more volumes about the fun or the type of person that he was that he brought to this locker room more so than anything,\u201d receiver Doug Baldwin said.Their warm comments were a reminder of how difficult it is to keep winning teams together in the N.F.L. The Seahawks were poised to win their second consecutive Super Bowl when, with the ball near the goal line, they opted to pass instead of hand off the ball to Lynch. The interception and loss that followed, against the New England Patriots, halted any talk of a dynasty and left some players, including Lynch, bitter.Now they had to defeat Lynch.They boarded a chartered Airbus A340-600 that included 45 sleeping pods in first class for the veteran players. Coach Pete Carroll sat in the first row of business class along with other coaches. Rookies and members of the practice squad sat behind them. About half the 170 passengers sat in coach, which was filled with giddy chatter before takeoff. The menu was the same for everyone: beef filet, Cajun chicken or herb roasted salmon.For this trip, Ramsden reversed the program: He told players to sleep as much as possible on the flight so when they arrived in London on Thursday afternoon, they would have enough energy to stay up until 9 or 10 p.m. and then get a full night\u2019s rest.\u201cWe try to protect their circadian rhythms as much as possible,\u201d Ramsden said.Ramsden\u2019s staff prepared sleep kits for \u201cmental alertness.\u201d They included blackout eye masks. Some players took melatonin or Ambien, while others used earbuds that played the sounds of wind and rushing water to induce sleep.A few people slept on the floor or were splayed across a row of seats. Wagner watched game video on his iPad. A half-dozen others, including the twins Shaquill and Shaquem Griffin, played the card game Spades in the bar area in first class. They trash-talked, laughed and threw $20 bills to the winners. They seemed unaware that Carroll, who tries to give his players room to be themselves, was sleeping in a seat a few feet away.The urgency of the moment seemed intangible \u2014 and maybe that was the point.The players and coaches rolled off the plane on Thursday about 1:30 p.m. Some players struggled to stay awake, like defensive end Frank Clark, who draped his thick coat over his head.Buses took them to the Grove, a resort in Watford, north of London, that features grass tennis courts and a golf course.It has plenty of amenities, but nothing was left to chance. The team shipped 1,150 rolls of athletic tape, two tons of medical supplies, 350 power adapters, 500 pairs of shoes and 240 pairs of socks. In all, the Seahawks had shipped 21,000 pounds of gear and products worth $770,000. Some items \u2014 toiletries, snacks, bottled water, Gorilla Glue, lighters (to burn off loose threads) and cayenne pepper, which when mixed with talcum powder keeps players\u2019 feet warm \u2014 were ordered from the Amazon U.K. website.In the evening, the players let off some steam at a Topgolf facility. Broken into groups of four, they tried to hit balls into giant holes to score points, and took grief every time they were wildly off target.\u201cIs that the best you can do?\u201d Wagner yelled at Austin Calitro, another linebacker.Thorpe, a cornerback, dug into a pile of chicken wings and posted videos on social media. \u201cThis is how I imagined it,\u201d he said of the team\u2019s first day in England.Wilson was in the first booth and seemed to be taking his swings seriously as the three veteran offensive linemen who sat with him checked their cellphones.Then, finally, it was time to return to the hotel, for smoothies, bottles of water and sleep.After several hours of meetings and a practice, some veterans left on a coach bus for Covent Garden and their only chance to see central London. Another bus took about a dozen younger players, with money in their pockets and no family in tow, to Watford Junction station, where they rode the train into London.At a loss where to go, a few English rugby players, who watched the Seahawks practice that day, helped them find Nike Town at Oxford Circus.At the front of the store, mannequins dressed in Seahawks gear stood next to racks of N.F.L. jerseys and shirts. \u201cMan, there\u2019s a lot of Patriots stuff here,\u201d Azeem Victor, a linebacker on the practice squad, said. As he looked for a soccer jersey, two shoppers separately asked him for help, assuming he worked there.Italian tourists asked to take photographs with the players, which made Rashaad Penny, a rookie running back, feel like a rock star. He soon video-chatted with somebody to describe what had happened.Penny and the other players were enjoying the chance to get away from the endless meetings and practices, and the expectations of their coaches and veterans. Lavon Coleman, another running back, stood wide-eyed in the street as people streamed past. He asked strangers for directions and food recommendations. He posed for pictures with Raiders fans from Denmark.\u201cI like that I can be myself,\u201d he said.A group of players went looking for food, but didn\u2019t seem interested in challenging their taste buds. They ended up at a Shake Shack. Linemen Jordan Roos and Elijah Nkansah went to a pub. Surprised by how warm their pints of Guinness were, they went to another pub and ordered lagers that were chilled to their satisfaction. Several more pints were consumed before, with the clock ticking toward the midnight curfew, they made their way to Euston station. There, they bumped into Brett Hundley, the backup quarterback, and several others. The players filled half a train car and compared notes on their first glimpses of London on a commuter train back to Watford Junction.Carroll takes his players to the stadium the day before a road game so they can visualize conditions ahead of time. At 1:30 p.m., the Seahawks drove to Wembley, where they saw the locker room, which had been set up with their gear, and the field, the most famous soccer pitch in England. Worried about the slickness of the grass, Erik Kennedy, the equipment manager, had longer screw-in cleats available for the players.Carroll and the team returned to the Grove around 4 p.m. Wilson, Wagner, Baldwin and a few other players got ready to meet two dozen fans in a session that was broadcast on Facebook Live.In the green room beforehand, the players signed footballs and helmets. Wilson, mindful of his public image, asked a producer if there was anything to worry about. He was assured that the talk was in front of friendly fans.At the event, Baldwin did not sugarcoat his description of the team, even in front of his coach.\u201cPete wouldn\u2019t want to call it this, but it\u2019s a retooling, a process we\u2019re all going through,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we\u2019re doing a great job of bringing the young guys along, of establishing what our culture is again, re-establishing it so the young guys can buy into it. It\u2019s been a difficult process but I think, moving forward, we\u2019re going to be really good.\u201dN.F.L. players do whatever they can to relax in the early hours on game day.Some Seahawks packed, others looked at yet more video.D.J. Fluker, the team\u2019s enormous guard, found solace in the players\u2019 lounge, where he sat alone playing the Madden football video game. Fluker, who filled his roster with current and former stars like Antonio Brown and Ronnie Lott, played a virtual foe. He flicked through offensive formations, which he said were similar to those in N.F.L. playbooks. He liked the distraction.\u201cIt takes away my anxiety,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I think about football too much, I\u2019ll get antsy. You can be overprepared.\u201dHe didn\u2019t need to worry. From the opening whistle of the game, the Seahawks seemed to have every advantage. The meticulous planning, the sleep kits, the choreographed downtime and maybe even the pints of Guinness seemed to help steady the players at a fragile moment. Or maybe they were just better.The defense stifled Lynch, the Raiders running back, while Wilson effortlessly led the Seahawks\u2019 offense up and down the field. Final score: 27-3.As the Seahawks piled back into their locker room, now 3-3 and brimming with confidence, one player yelled, \u201cFour thousand miles for the dub,\u201d a reference to a W, a win.Inside the locker room, before the news media were allowed in, the players were screaming and slapping shoulders. Rainn Wilson, an actor on the television comedy \u201cThe Office\u201d and a big Seahawks fan, was brought in to address the rowdy players. \u201cThat was Seahawks football today,\u201d he yelled as players whooped it up.Then Carroll, his voice hoarse, thanked the staff that organized the trip, \u201cthe whole thing.\u201dAt 1:30 a.m., the Seahawks departed Gatwick Airport. Coleman, sitting in economy class, collected piles of pillows and built a bed on the floor in front of an emergency exit.The flight home was far quieter than the one to London. The staff worked overtime during the four-day trip and many of them were asleep before takeoff. Exhausted after three hours of high-powered football, the players lumbered into their pods.Nearly 10 hours later, the plane landed in Seattle. Carroll spoke over the plane\u2019s intercom, announcing a day off for everyone who did not need to see the training staff. Cheers erupted.He called it a \u201cgreat week,\u201d and then said, \u201cTo everybody, thanks a lot, appreciate ya, love ya, bye.\u201dThe bliss lasted roughly 12 hours. In midafternoon, word spread that Allen, the team\u2019s owner and a co-founder of Microsoft, had died.In football and in life, even the best trips come to an end.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "2001: When the Internet Was, Um, Over?", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byyesterday in stylesAfter the 2000 dot-com crash and the Sept. 11 attacks, it seemed as if the era of cocky young Silicon Valley techies minting easy millions was over for good. Ha.So let\u2019s go easy on this 2001 Styles article that declared, well, not the end of the internet, precisely, but an end to the idea that the internet was culturally relevant and cool. The dot-com crash of 2000, and the Sept. 11 attacks the next year, marked \u201cthe next step after the bursting of the dot-com economic bubble,\u201d wrote the article\u2019s author, John Schwartz. Those twin cataclysms led to \u201cthe bursting of the cultural bubble, the end of the nerd as a crossover hit, of the I.P.O. zillionaire as role model to college students.\u201d It bears noting that Mark Zuckerberg would enroll at Harvard the following year. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.A generation of young entrepreneurs who had ridden the \u201cWorld Wide Web\u201d to overnight fortunes and rock star status saw their paper millions vanish overnight as the Nasdaq index collapsed by 78 percent. They lost a lot more than money, Mr. Schwartz argued. \u201cNot much more than a year ago, boosters of the New Economy and their true believers in the press were claiming to have changed all the rules.\u201d Mr. Schwartz quoted a New York Magazine article by Michael Wolff, \u201chimself a failed dot-com executive,\u201d who had written, \u201call it takes to make otherworldly riches is the will and desire.\u201d Indeed, it was not enough for the young web plutocrats to make money; \u201cthey had to make history,\u201d Mr. Schwartz wrote. \u201cNow they themselves are history.\u201dHenry Blodget, a former tech industry analyst \u201cwho became famous for predicting early that Amazon.com would reach $400 a share\u201d \u2014 jeepers!\u2014 announced that he was \u201ctaking a buyout and leaving Merrill Lynch at the grand old age of 35,\u201d and was also writing a book, Mr. Schwartz noted. Ellen DeGeneres even attempted a sitcom about a failed dot-com executive, which became another dot-bomb. \u201cFor the most part,\u201d Mr. Schwartz wrote, \u201cthe flood of dot-com failure stories is being met with a national yawn.\u201dCollege students who had spent the \u201990s with \u201cvisions of Testarossas dancing in their heads\u201d as they hoped to emulate geek stars like Marc Andreessen of Netscape were now saying that they want \u201cfulfilling jobs, not just ways of earning money,\u201d according to a University of Maryland professor quoted in the article. This made sense in an economy where many skeptics assumed the days of easy money were gone for good. As the writer Thomas Frank, a fierce critic of New Economy values, was quoted saying, \u201cthe Dow isn\u2019t going to go to 36,000, and the dot-coms aren\u2019t going to come back.\u201dBut with the wisdom of hindsight, it is clear that 2001 was not the end of internet culture, but rather, the end of the beginning of internet culture. Today\u2019s young tech moguls \u2014 like Facebook\u2019s $60 billion man, Mark Zuckerberg \u2014 are not only among the richest people in the world, they are also Beyonc\u00e9-level stars in the eyes of the starry-eyed postgraduates who flock to tech\u2019s promised land, hoping, like the characters in HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d to carve out their slice of the future.When contacted last week about the story, he thanked me for the opportunity to stay humble, but added: \u201cAs the story predicted, a new generation of companies has arisen and changed the world since that story ran: It includes Facebook, Twitter, Uber and Theranos.\u201d He continued, \u201cif there\u2019s a lesson in taking a new look at this old story, it has to be to never bet against greed, and never bet on a cultural shift that requires tech companies to grow a conscience.\u201dAdvertisement"}

From Honduras,\u201d one woman called out. \u201cAnd we\u2019re unable to stop them without giving them asylum.\u201dThen a second woman asked about immigration. And a third. And a fourth. And a fifth.Mr. Bacon, a centrist Republican seeking re-election in the only district in Nebraska that voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and sent a Democrat to Congress as recently as 2014, struggled to move the conversation along, alluding to \u201ca breakdown in the rule of law\u201d and his support for immigration measures that Democrats had blocked.But soon the banquet room, filled with a few dozen people who appeared mostly white and in their 60s and 70s, broke into chants of \u201cBuild the wall! Build the wall!\u201dBarely two weeks away from an election that threatens to sweep Republicans from power in the House of Representatives and dash any lingering hope of conservative immigration reform, the party, led by President Trump, is leaning more aggressively into dark portrayals of undocumented immigrants in a bid to galvanize voters.Mr. Trump, whose political appeal among his core voters has largely been rooted in warnings about illegal immigration as a threat to American security, sovereignty and identity, has stepped up his hard-line, inflammatory attacks on Latin American migrants as he travels the country campaigning to save Republicans\u2019 majorities in the House and Senate.His renewed emphasis on the issue reflects the belief by strategists in both parties that Republican candidates often benefit if they can link illegal immigration to crime, economic insecurity and terrorism \u2014 all resonant concerns with swing voters, especially women \u2014 and portray Democrats as too spineless to tackle the problem.Mr. Trump is also trying to link the issue to another powerful factor in the midterms: himself. With his legislative agenda\u2019s fate on the line, Mr. Trump, without offering any evidence, is accusing political opponents of orchestrating an invasion of foreigners so he and the Republicans will lose in November.\u201cA lot of money has been passing to people to come up and try and get to the border by Election Day, because they think that\u2019s a negative for us,\u201d he told the crowd. (How this would be a negative, he left unexplained, though he has falsely blamed his loss in the popular vote in 2016 on illegal voting by undocumented immigrants.)It did not appear that call would be coming. Democrats, in what amounts to a tacit acknowledgment of the power of Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, have mostly refrained from responding directly to his unfounded charges. In a joint statement on Saturday, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said the president was \u201cdesperate to change the subject from health care to immigration.\u201dExplaining how Trump supporters were likely to view illegal immigration, Mr. Nunberg said, \u201cOnce again, we believe that Donald Trump is under attack, and that the Democrats are orchestrating it.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Some strategists who have been advising Democrats on immigration issues have instructed them not to get drawn into a detailed debate by Republicans seeking to attack their positions, but to quickly pivot to friendlier terrain such as health care and wages.\u201cThey\u2019re not going to fall for his race-baiting divisiveness; they\u2019re going to promise to bring people together to address everyday challenges,\u201d said Frank Sharry, the executive director of America\u2019s Voice, an immigration advocacy group.The migrants cite various reasons for their journey. Some say they are fleeing gangs that terrorize their neighborhoods. Others cite searching for work and more stability for their families. Advocacy groups have, in the past, used caravans to draw attention to the desperate situation in countries like Honduras and push the United States to relax its immigration laws.Coverage of the caravan has become a vehicle for other conspiratorial story lines that are popular on the right. Sometimes they spread with the help of the president.\u201cCan you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?\u201d the president said on Twitter.Most Republicans are not unhappy with legal immigration, polling shows. An independent Grinnell College survey conducted in late August and early September found that just 21 percent of Republicans said the country had too many legal immigrants, compared with 12 percent of Democrats.The Grinnell poll also found Republicans were more likely to be worried about illegal immigration. Fifty-two percent incorrectly believed that undocumented immigrants committed more violent crimes than the general population, compared with 28 percent of Americans who believed that.In polling conducted for Mr. Bannon, the issue of illegal immigration substantially affected voters\u2019 perceptions of the two parties, helping to shrink a 9-point advantage for Democrats to 2 points.The issue is often powerful in the most competitive races, like Mr. Bacon\u2019s.In Nebraska, polling conducted by the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC, consistently found that the top two issues for voters were immigration and health care.Mr. Bacon\u2019s district, which covers most of Omaha and its suburbs, is 1,100 miles from the Mexican border and 73 percent white. Like many Republicans who have tried to spend their time with voters talking up the growing economy and lower tax rates, he is finding that immigration keeps coming up. In an interview after his remarks to the Republican businesswomen\u2019s club, Mr. Bacon described an exchange he had just had with a constituent. \u201cShe goes, \u2018Don, we don\u2019t care if they separate families,\u2019\u201d to which the congressman said he replied, \u201cWell, you\u2019re in the minority.\u201d\u201cI said I can\u2019t do that,\u201d Mr. Bacon added. \u201cI have to be honest.\u201dJeremy W.

{"Headline": "Wendell Berry\u2019s Right Kind of Farming ", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAgricultural choices must be made by these inescapable standards: the ecological health of the farm and the economic health of the farmer.Ms. Olmstead is an Idaho native living and writing outside Washington, D.C.How we farm matters. For the past two centuries, America\u2019s farms have expanded and homogenized, and farming equipment and chemicals have replaced personnel. Farmers have grown older and more isolated and are retiring without successors.This year\u2019s proposed Farm Bill awards millions of dollars to wealthy agribusiness and factory farms in the form of commodity subsidies and crop insurance, while cutting funds for important conservation and stewardship programs and offering little to beginning farmers and ranchers or local farmers markets and local food promotion.If politicians and journalists want to know about the problems of agriculture, they are not likely to go out into \u201crural America\u201d to observe the condition of the fields and the waterways or to talk to the farmers and the ex-farmers, the ex-merchants of the small towns, or to talk to the mayors and county judges of rural counties. Instead, they are very likely to talk to academic and bureaucratic experts, who are tightly bound within the industrial structure of agriculture, agri-science and agribusiness.Those problems could be summed up as the triumph of industrialism and industrial values over the lives of living creatures, and over the life of the living world. The preferences and choices of industrialism do not imply a limit of any kind. They rest instead upon the premises of limitless economic growth and limitless consumption, which of course implies limitless waste, and finally exhaustion.Nothing can take form except within limits. No cure is possible, either in policy or practice, except within understood limits, which is to say within a correct diagnosis. This requires patience. A good solution has to begin with a description of the problem that is full, clear, and reliable.A bill intending to help rural communities, furthermore, might forbid the large chain stores to underprice their goods in order to destroy locally owned small stores. I don\u2019t see why the government should not enforce honest prices for the same reason that it enforces honest weights and measures. I am sure that a lot of conservatives would object loudly to such \u201cregulation.\u201d But for small farms and small businesses, the \u201cfree market\u201d is not a \u201clevel playing field.\u201dBoth of the political sides, so far as I am concerned, have to accept responsibility for the emergence of Donald Trump, the autonomous man, the self-made man, economically \u201cfree\u201d and sexually liberated, responsible only to himself, starting from scratch and inventing his own way of doing things. To get outside the trajectory that produced Trump, we will have to go back to tradition. I am unsure when we began to think of, for instance, the 15th Psalm and Jesus\u2019s law of neighborly love as optional. They are not optional, as I think the Amish example proves, and as proved by present failure.Such an economy, within the variables of weather and human capability, would be formed within certain prescribed limits. To the extent that it would be limited and formed or formal, we might assume that it would be stable. Because such an economy has never been tried, we should not think of it with too much confidence. But there is certainly nothing limited or stable in our present casting about the \u201cglobe\u201d for supplies and demands. This, like our present society, is disorderly if not chaotic.The so-called global economy, because it is predicated on the exhaustion of natural sources and of the land-use economies, is far from a sure thing. An interesting question, then, is whether we might intentionally reform our economies upon the principle of self-sufficiency or be forced to do so by the failure of the global economy. Farmers by themselves can\u2019t protect themselves in a \u201cfree market\u201d economy whether it is national or global. At present they have only the very limited self-protection of supporting their own lives so far as possible from their own land \u2014 that is, by producing their own food and fuel, and by harvesting energy from their own sunlight.It can pretty well be demonstrated, however, that technological progress is the result of choices that have been made all the way from the inventors and manufacturers of technologies to the people who buy and use and pay for them. The important questions all have to do with the standards by which these choices are made. If the standards were different, different choices would be made. And in fact we have plenty of evidence that choices can be made that evidently were not made by your Iowa farmer. That the alternative choices often have to be made against powerful social pressures does not mean that they cannot be made or that they are not valid choices. The finally inescapable standards by which agricultural choices must be made are the ecological health of the farm and the economic health of the farmer.The problem of feeding the world should be addressed, first of all, by calculating the waste \u2014 from farmland and topsoil to thrown-away food \u2014 in the world\u2019s \u201cfood systems.\u201d Perhaps somebody has done this. If so, that is the place to start. The people, fairly numerous and highly credentialed, who argue that only industrial agriculture as we now have it can feed the world are arguing in fact that we can feed the world only by an agriculture that destroys both farmland and farmers. There is a point, obviously, beyond which this kind of agriculture will not be able to feed much of anybody.These clich\u00e9s are sustained by the \u201clarger cultural prejudice against manual labor,\u201d which you mention. But there also are active prejudices against farmers, country people, the country, small-town people and small towns. This at least begins the description of a large cultural problem. Because of such prejudices, and also because of economic adversity, farmers encourage their children to leave farming. Their departing children, so few of them as they now are, amount to an invaluable cultural and economic resource, to which our present economy attaches no value at all.What can we do about this? First, those of us who care must keep trying to bring about improvements, which we can do, and are doing, locally \u2014 where, in any event, the improvements will have to be made. Second, we have got to be patient. That this is a cultural problem means that it can\u2019t be simply or quickly solved. What you speak of as a \u201cpassion for farming\u201d can grow only from an understanding of the intelligence and the learning involved in the right kind of farming, and we should add an understanding of the better cultures of husbandry and of the traditional agrarian values. These things we must try to keep alive, not because of their \u201cpotential value\u201d but because they are now and forever right.Gracy Olmstead is an Idaho native living and writing outside Washington.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Three Canadian Novels Test the Bonds \u2014 and Boundaries \u2014 of Family", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe ShortlistProulx\u2019s sophomore novel, \u201cWe All Love the Beautiful Girls,\u201d opens with a sex scene whose heat makes for a stark contrast to the frigid Quebec winter in which the narrative\u2019s pivotal moments take place. The story centers on three well-to-do suburban families \u2014 the Slates, the Kellys and the Conrads \u2014 and one bleak February night that changes all their lives. Michael and Mia Slate suffer the most dramatically when they learn Michael\u2019s business partner and best friend, Peter Conrad, has cheated them out of millions. Simultaneously, their teenage son, Finn, passes out drunk and high in the snow, ultimately losing his right hand to the cold.Jumping among perspectives and told over the course of a year, the novel examines how these combined tragedies affect family members and those on the periphery, and the way these individuals isolate and hurt themselves as they try to weather the storm of their struggles. The first few pages introduce an enviable suburban life: weekend ski trips, lakeside summer cottages, beautifully appointed homes with gorgeous inhabitants. But that perfect patina is stripped away almost immediately in a setup evocative of Rick Moody\u2019s \u201cThe Ice Storm,\u201d ultimately showcasing the horrors that wealth and boredom and sadness can produce. \u201cWe have been so careless. Such careless, selfish people,\u201d Mia tells Michael. It is a realization that applies to everyone in this novel.The film version of Proulx\u2019s first novel, \u201cAnthem of a Reluctant Prophet,\u201d premiered this month at the Vancouver Film Festival, and it\u2019s not hard to imagine \u201cWe All Love the Beautiful Girls\u201d being adapted for the screen as well. The novel\u2019s visuals are vivid and well realized, the characters and their dramas cinematic. Yet as the pages progress, the imagery becomes oppressive. After Finn loses his hand, the many, many references to hands and arms feel overdone; Proulx goes so far as to have Michael take nightly batting practice against a machine called \u201cthe Arm,\u201d an all-too-explicit reference to that which his unathletic son lacks.But perhaps there\u2019s an argument to be made about the importance of that heavy-handedness. Even when things disappear \u2014 relationships, bank accounts, body parts \u2014 we are often still reminded of them every day. Phantom limbs. Phantom lives.\u201cNobody needs fishermen when there are no fish to catch, nobody needs net.\u201d But what happens to those fishermen, those net-makers, when the fish disappear? What about their families, their folklore? These are the questions asked in Hooper\u2019s second novel, \u201cOur Homesick Songs,\u201d which takes place in the Newfoundland coastal town of Big Running, an old fishing village that no longer has any fish \u2014 nor, therefore, by the government\u2019s estimation, any reason to exist.Nearly all of the town\u2019s residents have moved, but the Connor family has stuck it out. Amid a failing economy, and with barely enough food on the table, Aidan and Martha trade off leaving their children, Cora and Finn, for a month at a time to work oil and gas jobs a plane ride away. It\u2019s a financial stopgap until the fish come back \u2014 though it seems that may never happen. Ten-year-old Finn, however, believes that it will, and devotes his days to finding and summoning the fish.True to its title, \u201cOur Homesick Songs\u201d is filled with music. The lyrical language is met with literal accordions, violins and songs passed through generations, sung by parents and children and even mermaids (a phenomenon in which they all believe). The town is filled with magic, and so is Hooper\u2019s writing. She imbues Finn and Cora with ethereal quirks and hobbies that are sprinkled with something dreamlike \u2014 they transform abandoned homes into other countries, count the lights of fishing boats far out at sea like stars in the sky. Much of the narrative is interwoven with centuries-old maritime tales, as well as with family histories that are occasionally overkill. The chapters sway back and forth among perspectives and decades, echoing the manner in which water legends and sea skills themselves are inherited.This novel explores what happens when ancestral through-lines are severed, when a profession can no longer be passed on. There is of course the question of what happens to the children, but also one of what happens to the parents: How do you continue in life and in love when your most constant truth, in this case the sea and what it yields, has changed? \u201cOur Homesick Songs\u201d is a eulogy to not just a town but a lifestyle \u2014 one built on waves, and winds, and fish, and folklore.Hobson\u2019s debut novel, \u201cSummer Cannibals,\u201d takes place over the course of six frenzied days during which the adult Blackford children descend on their parents\u2019 home, a Georgian-style mansion on the shores of Lake Ontario. The family is built largely on spite and competition, the parents, David and Margaret, having named their three adult daughters, Georgina, Jacqueline and Philippa, after the boys their father hoped them to be. \u201cThey were, in the end, only girls,\u201d Hobson writes, clearly stating their lot in life. \u201cAnd nothing much had ever been expected of them.\u201dThe Blackfords are blindly devoted to one another \u2014 \u201cit was all there was and would ever be. It was family\u201d \u2014 though that sentiment remains confusingly unexamined considering how much anger exists among them. The impetus for the reunion is Philippa\u2019s \u201cprenatal depression,\u201d an illness severe enough to compel her to fly away from her husband and children in New Zealand to seek solace with her parents and sisters in Canada. David, for his part, has scheduled an ill-timed public tour of their home\u2019s ornate gardens, coinciding with the family\u2019s arrival. This plan causes a host of lasting problems.Philippa may be the only one going through immediate difficulty, but no one in this family is happy. Each marriage feels doomed, and as we skip among points of view it\u2019s evident that every character is deeply unfulfilled. Their discontent has a long history. The characters ruminate on the major regrets and secret tragedies of their pasts \u2014 memories of abuse and poor decisions that became the building blocks for their lives.On its own, the depressing family drama would be bearable, but Hobson loses her thread when \u201cSummer Cannibals\u201d veers into frenetic, upsetting, slapdash melodrama. At first, the distressed and moneyed world surrounding the Blackfords seems as if it might be an interesting place to get lost, but, after a few wrong turns by the author, a well-defined path would be welcomed.Elena Sheppard is pursuing her M.F.A. in nonfiction writing at Columbia University.Advertisement"}

The deliciousness of Mineo\u2019s pizza made the five miles my brothers and I biked through the predominately Jewish neighborhood of Squirrel Hill well worth it. But the sweet cheese and fresh meats weren\u2019t the only things that brought us back. We didn\u2019t dare enter certain neighborhoods for fear of scrapping with white boys or not being served. Squirrel Hill was one of the few nonblack neighborhoods that would welcome a group of black boys.In 1988, I transferred to Peabody High School, in the other significant Jewish neighborhood, Highland Park. It was right next to the majority-black areas of East Liberty and Garfield, and the fully integrated public school reflected the area\u2019s diversity. I had history teachers who made connections between the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple bombing in 1958 in Atlanta, and the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in 1963 in Alabama, solidifying for me how vulnerable black and Jewish communities are to white supremacy.As an athlete I competed against Jewish boys from another integrated school, Taylor Allderdice in Squirrel Hill. Sometimes after track meets, we got pizza at Mineo\u2019s. Squirrel Hill\u2019s vibrancy didn\u2019t come by chance. We learned how to live together. There was a deliberate investment in inclusion and peace.The Jewish community has been able to maintain that ethic of inclusion in Squirrel Hill. In 2018, blacks, immigrants and L.G.B.T. people crowd the streets with the same level of comfort I enjoyed as a child. Chatty college students in hoodies sit next to older Jews in skullcaps in coffee shops. When passengers step off the packed city buses along Forbes Avenue, they know they know they will be able to find whatever they need \u2014 an outfit for the weekend, a bite to eat, flowers for a date \u2014 in any of the shops on nearby Murray Avenue.Squirrel Hill is the draw, and the Tree of Life synagogue is its nucleus. The spirit of inclusivity starts there, and spills out in the rest of neighborhood. You see it in the diversity of people and also in the diversity of businesses and cultural events. They are geared to invite and support all the residents of the city \u2014 past, present and future.Instead, we have a president whose loose and divisive language sets the table for violence.My classmates and I may have lived in separate communities, but we learned how to study, play, eat and shop together. We had teachers, schools and synagogues that, in word and deed, made everyone feel welcome and included. Places like Squirrel Hill, Tree of Life and others like them are powerful, but they are not protected.

Or do you think Canada is making a mistake?On Wednesday morning, the government announced that it would introduce legislation to make it easier for Canadians who had been convicted of possessing small amounts of marijuana to obtain a pardon.While the government is not offering a blanket amnesty, Ralph Goodale, the public safety minister, said at a news conference in Ottawa that as \u201ca matter of basic fairness,\u201d the government would seek to end the minimum waiting period of five years to apply for a pardon as well as waiving the fee of 631 Canadian dollars.\u201cWe will make the application process as simple as it can be,\u201d Mr. Goodale said, adding that details would not be available for several weeks.Newfoundlanders became the first Canadians to be able to smoke pot legally on Wednesday, when retailers there opened in the country\u2019s easternmost province at midnight.Across the rest of the country, government-run stores were preparing to greet consumers, who will be able to choose among pre-rolled joints, fresh or dried marijuana flowers and cannabis oil \u2014 all of which are permitted under the new federal law.At a government cannabis store in eastern Montreal, a line stretched across a long city block on Wednesday morning.

{"Headline": "China to Pump $175 Billion Into Its Economy as Slowdown and Trade War Loom", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG \u2014 China is signaling that it is worried about its economy.Troubled by slowing growth, persistent debt problems and President Trump\u2019s trade war, the Chinese government has taken steps in recent months to shore up its economy. It has pared back a high-profile campaign to tackle debt. It has restarted big infrastructure projects, a traditional economic engine. It has even censored bad economic news.On Sunday, Beijing went one step further.The People\u2019s Bank of China, the central bank, pulled a financial lever that will effectively pump $175 billion into the economy. The government is aiming to help small and midsize businesses in particular, which have had trouble obtaining loans and face other rising pressures.The move signals that China\u2019s economy \u201cis really not doing well,\u201d Chen Shouhong, the founder of the investment information platform Gelonghui, wrote on WeChat, a popular Chinese social media service.So far, the trade war has had only a minor impact on China\u2019s $12 trillion economy. Trade isn\u2019t as important to China as it once was, thanks in part to the rise of a middle class that has been a ready buyer of Chinese goods at home. Still, tariffs could hurt the economy the longer they last. In September, new export orders \u2014 one indicator of China\u2019s manufacturing \u2014 fell to the lowest level since 2016.But China has bigger problems than the trade war.About $65.5 billion of that cash injection will be directed to banks to repay debts that are due in coming weeks, while the rest will be pushed into the financial market.The central bank made the move to ensure \u201creasonable and sufficient liquidity\u201d in China\u2019s economy, it said. This is the fourth time this year that the central bank has cut the reserve ratio.But this time, the reserve ratio cut, which is set to go into effect on Oct. 15, was unusually big and broad. While the central bank cut the reserve ratio by a similar amount earlier this year, it put more conditions on how banks could use the extra money. The bank has shied away from making such stark moves in recent years, as it has found more subtle ways to adjust the amount of money in China\u2019s financial system depending on its needs.The announcement on Sunday suggests the central bank felt it had to do more than that. The size and breadth of the move, wrote Mr. Chen, the Gelonghui founder, shows \u201cthere are fewer and fewer tools in the P.B.O.C. toolbox.\u201dThe move was in direct response to the slowing growth, Zhang Ming, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said on Sunday. Mr. Zhang predicted that China\u2019s third-quarter gross domestic product would drop to 6.6 percent growth compared with 6.8 percent a year ago and that its fourth-quarter figure could be as low as 6.4 percent. China posted economic growth of 6.7 percent in the quarter that ended in June, though China\u2019s official figures are widely doubted.\u201cSino-U.S. trade frictions will further reduce the contribution of imports and exports to economy growth,\u201d Mr. Zhang, who is also chief economist at Ping An Securities, wrote on WeChat.\u201cIf export growth slows down due to trade frictions, it will influence manufacturing investment growth,\u201d he added.Ailin Tang contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Congress Backs F.A.A. Measure but With Few New Traveler Protections", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCongress approved legislation on Wednesday that reauthorizes the Federal Aviation Administration for five years.The legislation bars in-flight cellphone calls as well as the forcible removal of passengers. But perhaps more important is what is not in the bill. There are no new rules on airlines\u2019 fees for reservation changes or bags and there is no move to privatize air traffic control.Part of the bill requires the F.A.A. to determine within a year the minimum distance between seats by studying how quickly people can safely evacuate different airplane configurations. Most airlines in the United States currently put 30 inches of space between rows in economy class, though some no-frills airlines like Spirit put only 28 inches between seats.\u201cIf they come up with a minimum seat regulation, that minimum will mirror the minimum in the market today,\u201d said Samuel Engel, the senior vice president for aviation at the consulting group ICF. \u201cSo it won\u2019t make things better.\u201dThe legislation was already approved by the House last month, and the Senate passed it on Wednesday by a vote of 93 to 6. The F.A.A. has been operating without long-term authorization since 2017. Congress has granted a series of temporary extensions for the last year.\u201cA real five-year bill is vastly, vastly more stable than a series of extensions,\u201d Mr. Engel said. \u201cIt removes quite a bit of uncertainty about the shape of the law for the next five years.\u201d He added, \u201cAs long as you\u2019re in that series of extensions, important projects get put on hold.\u201dThe airlines\u2019 trade group, Airlines for America, also noted that the five-year reauthorization \u201cprovides long-term certainty\u201d for the industry.As to any added protections for travelers, Mr. Engel said: \u201cThe things in the bill that look like wins for consumers are really just for show. What are the so-called consumer protections in the bill? They are: You can\u2019t talk on your cellphone. You can\u2019t do that anyway. You can\u2019t put your dog in the overhead. That\u2019s not a daily problem.\u201dOne section of the bill bars airlines from forcibly removing seated passengers if the flight is overbooked. But traveler advocates said that was a continuation of the status quo. \u201cThe provision that you can\u2019t be bumped once you\u2019re on an airplane has been the custom since the Dr. Dao incident, but now it\u2019s the law,\u201d said Paul Hudson, president of Flyers Rights, a passenger advocacy group. He was referring to a situation in April 2017 when David Dao, a pulmonologist, was injured while being forcibly removed from an overbooked United Airlines flight, even though he had bought a ticket for the flight.Flyers Rights was also one of the main advocates for getting the F.A.A. to regulate economy seat size. But Mr. Hudson seemed concerned about the possible outcome of the study.\u201cWe hope it goes one way, but we\u2019re cautiously wondering if it will wind up where it is now,\u201d he said in an interview. Even if the F.A.A. does ultimately decide to give passengers more room, he said it could take a long time before most travelers see any changes. \u201cThere\u2019s a history with the F.A.A. of delaying regulations, grandfathering regulations or granting waivers or exemptions.\u201dHenry Harteveldt, founder of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco, said he, too, did not expect much improvement. \u201cAs much as I would personally like to see more legroom in economy, as an analyst I recognize that the airlines are going to turn around and say that the flights are going to get more expensive,\u201d he said. \u201cBe prepared to pay more for your ticket.\u201dHe did note that the legislation includes \u201cminimum rest time for flight attendants for the first time, which is going to increase safety.\u201dMr. Harteveldt and Mr. Engel both said that some of the most important aspects of the bill are things Congress declined to address.\u201cBecause the airlines successfully lobbied against having the bill include regulations against baggage and ticket change fees, that was removed,\u201d Mr. Harteveldt said, pointing out that passengers had hoped for possible regulation or elimination of some ancillary charges.In Mr. Engel\u2019s view, Congress chose to punt on one major issue.\u201cOnce again, the U.S. is declining to corporatize the F.A.A.,\u201d he said, explaining that other countries have successfully privatized air traffic control. Those companies can then plan their finances over longer periods, making the air traffic control systems more stable and adaptable. \u201cThat\u2019s particularly disappointing because it really was a stated objective of the Trump administration.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "From In-N-Out to the County Fair: Republican John Cox Tries to Make a Name in California", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. \u2014 John Cox, the Republican businessman running for governor of California, and his small entourage breezed through the doors of an In-N-Out Burger in Ventura County the other day. Mr. Cox introduced himself to a couple at a corner table eating burgers, mentioning how he has been rising in some polls.\u201cPeople still don\u2019t know who I am,\u201d he said to the couple. \u201cYou\u2019ve barely heard of me, right?\u201dYes, that\u2019s right.As he was leaving, Robert Risinger, 57, was one of the few who did recognize Mr. Cox and said, \u201cGood luck, I hope you win.\u201d After he was gone, trailed by the aroma of Double-Doubles and fries, Mr. Risinger, who described himself as an \u201cindependent centrist,\u201d meant he believed Mr. Cox had no shot, quickly adding, \u201cthis isn\u2019t a liberal state; this is a leftist state.\u201dSuch is the uphill battle for a Republican running for governor in California, where no Republican has won statewide office since Arnold Schwarzenegger won the governor\u2019s seat in 2006. Analysts have called the campaign just short of a coronation for Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor and former mayor of San Francisco, in the race to replace the popular outgoing governor, Jerry Brown.And Mr. Cox has a resonant message: that too many Californians, amid an economic boom that catapulted the state to the fifth largest economy in the world, are struggling to make it. Tens of thousands of Californians are homeless, neighborhoods resemble dystopian tent cities. Housing prices have skyrocketed, putting homeownership out of reach for millions.A recent television ad from Mr. Cox\u2019s campaign paints a bleak picture of California, saying, \u201cGavin Newsom, it happened on your watch.\u201dIn his campaign, Mr. Newsom echoes many of Mr. Cox\u2019s concerns about issues confronting the state, but as the two candidates agree on the diagnosis, they differ on the remedy. Mr. Newsom would spend more money on housing subsidies and push for single-payer health care. Mr. Cox has offered a conservative approach, saying he would cut red tape and regulations to bring down the cost of housing, spend more on addiction and mental health treatment, and support efforts to force homeless people into treatment.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have a legal right to pitch a tent in front of Steven Spielberg\u2019s house, even if I\u2019m mentally ill,\u201d Mr. Cox said in an interview on his campaign bus, driving from the In-N-Out to a gas station in Santa Clarita, where he talked to drivers about California\u2019s high gas prices, one of his campaign issues. \u201cThat hurts his standard of living. And by the way, it\u2019s not compassionate either. It\u2019s not compassionate to let people sleep in the streets.\u201dIn the debate, Mr. Cox said as governor he would reduce regulations that he believes have driven up the cost of homes. \u201cMy vision of California is where people can afford to buy a house,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can afford gasoline. They can afford water, electricity.\u201dGiven the lack of debates, analysts say California voters are being deprived of the opportunity to size up their choices.\u201cThese two candidates are not really sitting down together and having an earnest conversation about what ails California and who has the better solution,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution and former adviser to Pete Wilson, a Republican governor.As for Mr. Newsom, Mr. Cox said, \u201cmy opponent is all about the House. And why is that? He wants chits when he runs for president.\u201dMr. Newsom has consistently batted away presidential speculation, and his spokesman, Nathan Click, said in response to Mr. Cox\u2019s comment, \u201cJohn Cox, President Trump\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and total lackey, would love nothing more than having two more years of a G.O.P.-controlled Congress ramming Trump\u2019s harmful agenda down Californians\u2019 throats.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.A multimillionaire who grew up in Chicago, Mr. Cox made much of his fortune as a real estate developer, building apartments in the Midwest. He was once registered as a Democrat \u2014 he voted for Jimmy Carter \u2014 and ran for office as a Republican in Illinois, for Congress, Senate, the Cook County recorder of deeds and briefly for president, in the 2008 race. He lost each time. In 2007 he bought a house in Rancho Santa Fe in San Diego County, and has spoken about his longstanding ties to the state, where his grandparents and mother came for retirement.Mr. Cox was lifted in the June primary by an endorsement tweet from President Trump. Analysts say Republicans have never thought he had a chance in the race, but calculated that getting a candidate for governor on the November ballot would draw Republicans to the polls and help in the races they were really focused on: protecting Republican congressional seats.\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a Republican on the ballot for governor or Senate, it just turns off voters,\u201d Mr. Whalen said.An effort to repeal California\u2019s gas tax with a ballot proposition, which Mr. Cox supports, was also embraced by the Republican Party as a way to get Republicans to the polls. But that has so far sputtered; polls now show the initiative is struggling to pass.Mr. Cox has garnered endorsements from reliably conservative constituencies, such as farmers and law enforcement groups who believe recent criminal justice reforms to reduce mass incarceration have led to an increase in crime. \u201cHe cares about victims of crime and will make our communities and our schools safer,\u201d said Ron Hernandez, the president of the Association of Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs.The Orange County Register, in endorsing Mr. Cox, reflected a widespread anxiety among Republicans in the state about Mr. Newsom: that government spending will soar and crimp economic growth. As governor, Mr. Cox, the newspaper wrote, \u201cwill encourage economic growth, expand housing opportunities and reverse the state\u2019s affordability crisis.\u201dSo Mr. Cox has taken to the road to engage in retail politicking. Dressed in bluejeans, with a head of white hair and the bearing of a dad out running weekend errands, he made his way up the state on his green and white bus emblazoned with the slogan \u201c#HelpIsOnTheWay.\u201dThe tour began at a Sriracha factory, in eastern Los Angeles County, where Mr. Cox spoke with workers about the cost of living, and was served chocolate ice cream spiced with the hot sauce. \u201cThe breakfast of champions,\u201d he told his hosts. \u201cI can feel a little bit of kick in there.\u201dThen it was onto a Costco gas station to highlight high prices at the pump. \u201cI have a captive audience here in line,\u201d he joked.To one driver at the gas station, Mr. Cox dismissed Mr. Newsom\u2019s recent tour of Democratic campaign offices, saying: \u201cMy opponent went to political offices and talked to operatives. I like talking to real people.\u201dA few hours later, at the Kern County Fair in Bakersfield, Mr. Cox addressed a friendly audience. \u201cI\u2019m a farmer, so I\u2019m obviously not too excited about Gavin Newsom,\u201d said Todd Tracy, who grows pistachios and almonds and, like many farmers, worries about water resources and blames environmentalists for protecting fish at the expense of agriculture.Unlike Mr. Newsom, who relishes challenging President Trump and his agenda, Mr. Cox does not talk much about the president. The pick-me-up tweet may have helped Mr. Cox in the primary, but any association with him is seen as a liability now that Mr. Cox is seeking support from independents in a state where Mr. Trump\u2019s approval rating is around 36 percent.\u201cI think you never want to turn down the president of the United States,\u201d said Mr. Cox, who said he did not vote for Mr. Trump and has never spoken to him. \u201cI respect him and the office. But I\u2019m my own man. I\u2019m talking about the issues that affect California, most of which he has nothing to do with.\u201dOn the bus, Mr. Cox talked about the challenge of getting his name out there.\u201cWe have a politician, Mr. Newsom, who has made a name for himself,\u201d Mr. Cox said. \u201cMade a national name for himself as mayor of San Francisco. So his name recognition is probably 95 or 99 percent. Against a business guy who just came out of the woodwork basically. I\u2019m not a celebrity. I\u2019ve never sought the limelight for anything here. I\u2019m getting known. I expect over the next 30, 40 days people are going to know who I am.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "A History of Studio 54, This Time Told by the Quiet Partner", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAt one point in the new documentary \u201cStudio 54,\u201d Michael Jackson wanders into a television interview that the club\u2019s co-owner Steve Rubell is doing. Asked what it is that he likes about Studio 54, a shockingly relaxed and smiling Jackson says, \u201cI like the atmosphere \u2014 the feeling, the excitement.\u201cIt\u2019s where you come when you want to escape. When you dance here, you\u2019re just free.\u201dAs the film shows, though, that sense of freedom came with a cost. Rather than using Studio 54 to tell a more expansive story about the disco movement, the director Matt Tyrnauer looks closely at the nuts and bolts of what it took to create the most famous nightclub in the world and what brought it crashing down.\u201cStudio 54 is one of those stories everyone thinks they know, but they don\u2019t,\u201d Mr. Tyrnauer said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe phenomenon is very different from perception \u2014 which is sex, drugs, disco, mountains of cocaine, Liza Minnelli, period.\u201cFor me, this is really an operatic, tragic story of the years ending the sexual revolution. The timing is haunting \u2014 Studio was open for 33 months, from April 1977 to January 1980. That 1980 date was also the beginning of the H.I.V./AIDS era, with the first cases surfacing about that time.\u201dAt the heart of \u201cStudio 54\u201d is the partnership of the founders Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager, two strivers from Brooklyn who met at Syracuse University and rode the rocket of success before pleading guilty to tax evasion in 1979 and serving 20 months in jail. The film is able to explore the inner workings of the club, and this friendship, because, for the first time, Mr. Schrager speaks at length about his Studio 54 experiences.\u201cForty years later, it\u2019s a wound that healed, though I still have the scar,\u201d Mr. Schrager (whose eponymous company now runs dozens of boutique hotels around the world) said in a phone conversation. \u201cI wanted to do something for my family that would really give them an idea what it was like.\u201dMr. Tyrnauer knew that Mr. Schrager had very conflicted feelings about that phase of his life. \u201cThis was kind of a reckoning for him with something very important in his life and career, but too hot to touch as a traumatic memory,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Ian, it was a flameout \u2014 the thing that made him famous also landed him in prison.\u201d\u201cStudio 54\u201d documents the frantic efforts required for Mr. Rubell and Mr. Schrager to create the glamorous, liberating club of their dreams in an abandoned former opera house turned television studio on crime-ridden West 54th Street. They didn\u2019t have a building permit when they started construction, which was completed in six weeks. Studio 54 had no liquor license when it opened \u2014 every day, they would get a temporary catering permit, a stopgap that continued for more than a year, and ultimately set their downfall in motion.Opening night was a mob scene (\u201cWe were actually scared,\u201d Mr. Schrager said, \u201cwe had to bring all the security inside out onto the street\u201d), and then it was a matter of constantly scrambling to feed the beast of success. But between the extroverted Mr. Rubell\u2019s cultivation of celebrities and the studious Mr. Schrager\u2019s sense of style and theatricality, they set out to create the perfect party every night.\u201cIt was the most magical club that ever existed,\u201d Nile Rodgers of Chic, disco\u2019s greatest band, said in a telephone interview. \u201cLots of clubs evoke a certain era \u2014 the Cotton Club, the Moulin Rouge, the Copacabana \u2014 but none of those did what Studio 54 did, where if you got in, you were a star, not just a person.\u201dThat kind of power gave the Studio 54 team a sense of invincibility, an arrogance that antagonized those who didn\u2019t make the inner circle. \u201cAfter a while, everybody had it in for them,\u201d Mr. Rodgers said, \u201csimply because they wouldn\u2019t let everybody in.\u201dWhen Mr. Rubell boasted to New York magazine that \u201conly the mafia does better\u201d than Studio 54, the Internal Revenue Service took the bait, raiding the club in December 1978 and alleging that the owners had skimmed more than $2 million from the profits.\u201cThere was a real backlash against Studio, a groundswell of resentment,\u201d Mr. Schrager said. \u201cWe were the poster boy for all that was wrong in the economy, in city life \u2014 we got so many people aggravated at us, there was a need to bring it down, a lot of bad karma at the end.\u201dMr. Schrager had never spoken about his father before (\u201cThat was the biggest shock,\u201d Mr. Rodgers said, \u201cmy face dropped when I saw that\u201d), and he is visibly uncomfortable on film discussing this part of his history. It\u2019s indicative of a culture of secrets that Mr. Tyrnauer said characterized the time. He added that Mr. Schrager didn\u2019t even know that Mr. Rubell \u2014 with whom he opened the Palladium nightclub and created the boutique hotel category after they got out of jail \u2014 was gay until very near his death from complications of AIDS in 1989.\u201cBy today\u2019s standards, you would consider that to be a shocking omission in a close personal relationship,\u201d Mr. Tyrnauer said. \u201cIt reminded me that this time is so near and yet so far away.\u201dMr. Schrager believes there were two defining events for his generation \u2014 Woodstock and Studio 54 \u2014 and he invokes Walt Disney and Steve Jobs as kindred creative spirits. \u201cWhen I went into the hotel world, I knew that you have to create a visceral experience, and I learned that from Studio,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat distinguishes the product is the magic, the alchemy that happens when you put it together.\u201dHe said, though, that if he were creating Studio 54 again, he would take a different approach to the door policy. \u201cInstead of letting all the celebrities in, I would let the bankers in.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ireland Bill Aims to Crack Down on Excessive Drinking With Health Warning Labels", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDUBLIN \u2014 Ireland will impose tobacco-style health warning labels on alcohol as part of a sweeping package of restrictions intended to tackle what a World Health Organization survey ranks as one of the world\u2019s worst rates of binge drinking.A bill that passed the Irish Parliament\u2019s lower house on Wednesday limits alcohol advertising and requires that alcoholic products be separated from retail areas inside shops. It also demands health warnings, including about links to cancer, both on bottles and at the point of sale \u2014 even in shops and visitor centers attached to breweries and distilleries, which are major tourist attractions in a country famed for its exports of stout, cider and whiskey.The measure is the first in Ireland to treat excessive alcohol consumption as a health problem rather than as an issue of licensing or of law and order. It includes a minimum sales price per unit of alcohol and bans the advertising of alcohol in publicly owned parks and at sports events catering mainly to children.This year, Scotland became the first nation to introduce minimum alcohol unit prices, and many other countries restrict alcohol advertising and sponsorship to varying degrees. But Ireland\u2019s bill will be the first national law \u2014 unless successfully challenged in court \u2014 to require alcohol manufacturers to display warning labels about specific health risks.The labels must also specify for the first time the number of calories in a beverage, and the total alcohol content in grams as opposed to merely the percentage of alcohol.Patricia Callan, director of Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, an industry lobby group, said that it supported the objectives of the legislation but believed it was not evidence-based and would harm an important Irish industry.\u201cNo other country in the world requires mandatory cancer warning labels,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd imposing such a label will cause substantial reputational damage to our quality products by applying a stigma to products made in Ireland.\u201dThe flip side of the alcohol industry\u2019s commercial and marketing success in Ireland, analysts say, is a culture that has traditionally tolerated, and sometimes even encouraged, heavy drinking.The country\u2019s Health Research Board estimated that in 2015 Irish people above the age of 15 consumed on average the equivalent of 41 liters of standard whiskey or vodka, or more than 116 bottles of wine, per head each year.The World Health Organization survey also found that Ireland ranked 12th in the world in terms of average alcohol consumption, while in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of developed economies, it ranked fourth, behind Estonia, Austria and France.Alcohol Action Ireland, a group of activists and health professionals that lobbied for the new law, says that alcohol causes, on average, three deaths every day in Ireland and is a factor in half of all suicides and a third of cases of deliberate self-harm. Excessive drinking disrupts families and communities, it says, and is also a factor in many assaults, rapes and murders, and in two-fifths of all traffic accidents in the country.While many Irish people are already aware of the social and health costs of alcohol consumption, the strong link between excessive alcohol use and several types of cancer has caught some by surprise.In the course of the debate, the opposition\u2019s health spokesman, Stephen Donnelly, reversed his party\u2019s earlier objection to the cancer labels, admitting that he had been shocked by research that showed 500 Irish people died of alcohol-related cancers each year, \u201cabout three times the number of people who die on the roads,\u201d he said.The bill was fiercely resisted by a number of groups representing alcohol manufacturers, distributors and retailers. Parliamentary opposition and delays meant that almost three years have passed between the bill\u2019s initial introduction and its passage, which was greeted by applause in the Dail, the lower house of the Irish Parliament.Simon Harris, the health minister, joined his predecessors in championing the bill and said that he would like to examine further restrictions on alcohol advertising and sports sponsorship in the future.Ireland, despite being a small island nation of fewer than five million people, has experience in introducing groundbreaking health legislation. In 2004, Michael Martin, then the minister for health, stunned critics and tobacco industry lobbyists by passing the world\u2019s first law to ban smoking in the workplace \u2014 including in bars, restaurants and offices. In the years since the law\u2019s passage, much of the rest of the developed world has followed suit.Now that it has passed through the Dail, the bill on alcohol will go the Seanad, or senate, for further debate. The Seanad has limited powers to delay or amend the bill. The Irish government says, however, that the constitutionality of the law could yet be contested by the drinks lobby in court, or by other member states of the European Union.It could still be several years before warning labels appear on alcoholic beverages in Ireland, and even then there will be an exemption for alcohol bottled for export or for sale in duty-free shops.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "In August, amid a leadership shakeup, the Australian government blocked Huawei, a Chinese company whose technology underpins mobile broadband for about half of all Australians, from building the country\u2019s future 5G networks.The ban was made under the pretext of protecting national security, yet there is no evidence that Huawei gear is insecure. Because it is headquartered in China, Huawei has undergone more scrutiny than any other ICT supplier in the world. In several markets, including the U.K., its source code is reviewed by independent security experts. In the 31 years since Huawei\u2019s founding, no public evidence of wrongdoing has ever come to light. Canberra\u2019s decision to ban the company was purely political.Australian citizens will be paying for that decision for decades to come. 5G will form the basis of future broadband networks. By keeping a leading 5G provider out of its market, Australia has reduced the country\u2019s supply of telecommunications infrastructure just as demand for 5G is starting to grow. Basic economics dictates that when supply drops, costs rise. Perhaps that is why Americans live with the second-highest prices in the world for mobile phone services. In the United States, 90 percent of wireless infrastructure sales are made by just two companies, Ericsson and Nokia. Meanwhile, the quality of U.S. mobile service measured by download speeds is ranked 61st in the world, after Chile, Egypt and Peru.National security obviously takes precedence over download speeds. But if security is the goal, banning telecom suppliers on the basis of geographic origin makes no sense. Today\u2019s telecommunications industry is transnational and borderless. Threats can originate anywhere. Programmable code can be implanted virtually in hardware and software, allowing malicious actors to spy or launch a cyberattack. Unauthorized functionality can compromise the product of any company, anywhere in the world.While no evidence exists that Huawei has been compromised by the Chinese government or any other actors, the United States, by contrast, has a long track record of modifying products to achieve its goals. From the 1940s until the early 1990s, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) rigged encryption systems sold by Crypto AG, a Swiss company, enabling the agency to read the coded diplomatic and military traffic of more than 120 countries. Later that decade, it reduced the level of security in non-U.S. versions of internet browsers and email programs made by Lotus Notes, Netscape and Microsoft to make files encrypted with those programs easy to decrypt. More recently, the NSA intercepted Cisco routers and covertly installed spyware on them before they were shipped to customers. The agency\u2019s ongoing Bullrun program places back doors into commercially available cryptographic software and hardware, or weakens the encryption so that the NSA can break the code. Australia\u2019s government does not trust Huawei, or China, or any Chinese company. Nor should they \u2014 in the digital domain, no one should be trusted. Negotiating arms treaties with the Soviet Union, former U.S. President Ronald Regan said that the best approach was to \u201ctrust but verify.\u201d Today, smart governments will dispense with trust and proceed straight to verification. Instead of pointlessly banning individual companies, they will establish comprehensive risk-mitigation procedures based on global best practices.

In recent years, a poor economy and bleak employment outlook have forced many young people to leave Accettura. While foreign investment remains prevalent in Italy\u2019s north, the south lags behind. But, during the Maggio, some 1,000 emigrants return to celebrate.A few months later, on the Feast of the Ascension, a group of woodsmen walk more than 12 miles to the Montepiano forest to cut down an oak to portray the groom, or the maggio, which is then secured to pairs of oxen and walked back to the village. \u201cIt has to be the highest and the straightest in the forest,\u201d Mr. De Bartolo said.On Pentecost Sunday, another group goes to the Gallipoli Cognato forest to cut down a treetop for the cima, or bride. The cima is carried by foot to the village, while locals dance, sing and play music. \u201cIt has to be the most beautiful and the most leafy to be considered the treetop,\u201d Mr. De Bartolo said.At sunset on the Tuesday after Pentecost, the maggio and the cima are married, and usually joined and hoisted up by a pulley.Mr. De Bartolo, 48, comes from Bari, in the Apulia region of southern Italy, about 91 miles northeast of Accettura. \u201cIn Apulia, these kind of rites don\u2019t exist,\u201d he said. \u201cI have known this rite for only a few years, and I fell in love with it immediately.\u201dIt\u2019s not surprising that a pagan holiday involves tree worship. Pagans often worshiped trees as people. In ancient Greece, worship of Zeus took place in groves of oak, and oaks were associated with Jupiter, the Roman equivalent of Zeus. It\u2019s possible the Accettura tradition goes back to the Greeks, who settled in southern Italy in the eighth and seventh centuries B.C.\u201cThere are a lot of these rites that are in danger of disappearing,\u201d Mr. De Bartolo said. \u201cAnd I would like, also with the help of photography, to preserve them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Will One State Go It Alone to Make Polluters Pay?", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProponents say Washington State is a good place to try out carbon reduction ideas because it has abundant hydropower and a waning reliance on fossil fuels. The coal-fired power plant near Centralia, Wash., is scheduled to start shutting down in the next few years.CENTRALIA, Wash. \u2014 The last coal mine in Washington State closed down about a decade ago in Centralia, about 65 miles south of Seattle, leaving scars on the land and the local economy. Now, a solar electricity project \u2014 perhaps the largest in the state \u2014 is planned for the same location, by the same company that once ran the mine.Bob Guenther sees that as a sign that the struggling stretch of Washington State where he has lived most of his life can find a new way forward.\u201cThat\u2019s the vision, a clean energy hub,\u201d said Mr. Guenther, 74, who worked for three decades at a coal-fired power plant in Centralia that is scheduled to start shutting down in a few years. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a new economy, and we\u2019re going to have to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and do everything we can to get it.\u201dOne piece of that transformation, Mr. Guenther said, will be decided on Election Day by people across the state, who will vote on whether to charge companies and utilities for their carbon emissions. The proposed carbon fees, aimed at curbing climate change by making the burning of fossil fuels more expensive, would be the first such state initiative in the nation, and other states are closely watching the election outcome.Opponents like Gary Stamper, a county commissioner and former school principal, said he feared that the rural area around Centralia would see little of the financial benefit from the fees the state collects, while the companies that pay the fees would pass the extra costs along to residents. That would be hard on Centralia, which is still trying to recover from the coal mine closure in 2006 and the national recession that followed.\u201cIt would hurt my constituents,\u201d Mr. Stamper said, adding that the last thing this region needs are more economic challenges: \u201cNot that I\u2019m not supporting clean air or clean water and all the things that go along with it, but it seems to me we\u2019re going to bear the brunt.\u201dIf the initiative passes, the fees would start at $15 for each ton of gases produced in fossil-fuel combustion, and would rise over time. Some major industries, like aviation, would be exempt, but even so, the fees would still be expected to raise $2.3 billion in the first five years.A previous carbon-pricing effort was defeated by Washington voters in 2016, and a plan by Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, to pass a carbon pricing system through the Legislature died earlier this year without a vote. Shaping those debates was Washington\u2019s defining political tension, between liberal-leaning residents of the economically booming Puget Sound area near Seattle and the more conservative, less prosperous rural areas to the east and south.This time around, there are notable differences. The earlier efforts called for carbon taxes; this year\u2019s version is technically not a tax but a fee, which may sound more palatable to voters. Unlike tax receipts, which legislators could get their hands on to use for other purposes, the fee revenue would have be spent on efforts like carbon and pollution reduction and forest health programs under a specified formula.Some environmental groups opposed the previous ballot measure because it also would have lowered other taxes, meaning that the state would not have netted much new revenue for climate or energy projects.If the carbon fee initiative passes, the investments it would finance could include anything from energy efficiency upgrades to electrified transit projects. Aid to low-income residents and to workers who are displaced from fossil-fuel industries are built into the measure as well.Washington starts the conversation about energy at a different place than any other state in the nation. By virtue of the region\u2019s topography, hydrology and the engineering feats of the federal dam builders who began remaking the Columbia River basin in the 1930s, the energy debate in the Pacific Northwest is distinct.Large-scale power production from the dams \u2014 more than twice as much as Oregon, the No. 2 state for hydropower output \u2014 means that Washington already emits less carbon dioxide for each unit of energy it produces than any other state, according to federal figures. What\u2019s more, the Pacific Northwest has little oil or gas to drill for or fight over, and the region\u2019s coal deposits have played out or become uneconomical.Supporters of a carbon fee say the state\u2019s extensive base of renewable, nonpolluting energy makes it the perfect laboratory to test efforts like this, because the economic impact would be less dramatic than in big coal states like West Virginia or Kentucky.Opponents say the state\u2019s unusual characteristics and the way the ballot measure is structured will make the carbon fee unfair and unlikely to have an impact on air quality or climate change. Consumers could pay higher costs, they say, and some industries will be hit far harder than others because of the exemptions. Among those who would receive exemptions is TransAlta, which owns the soon-to-close coal-fired power plant in Centralia as well as the old coal mine where the new solar installation is planned.The pain of a long economic downturn, though, runs deep. Unemployment remains higher in Lewis County, which includes Centralia, than the state average, and wages there are lower.Not long ago, TransAlta donated 1,000 acres of land to go toward new economic development. But the industrial park planned for that land is empty so far, home to elk, geese and an occasional wandering bear. Some potential tenants have expressed hesitancy to make a commitment until the carbon-fee question is answered at the ballot box, said Allyn Roe, the industrial park\u2019s chief operating officer.\u201cThe uncertainty is not helping,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin.

{"Headline": "When Sears Flourished, So Did Workers. At Amazon, It\u2019s More Complicated.", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHalf a century ago, a typical Sears salesman could walk out of the store at retirement with a nest egg worth well over a million in today\u2019s dollars, feathered with company stock. A warehouse worker hired now at Amazon who stays until retirement would leave with a fraction of that.Much as Sears has declined in the intervening decades, so has the willingness of corporate America to share the rewards of success. Shareholders now come first and employees have been pushed to the back of the line.This shift is broader than a single company\u2019s culture, reflecting deep changes in how business is now conducted in America. Winner-take-some has evolved into winner-take-most or -all, and in many cases publicly traded companies are concentrating wealth, not spreading it. Profit-sharing and pensions are a rarity among the rank-and-file, while top executives take home an increasing share of the spoils.Amazon shareholders have benefited more than workers, but Sears, in its heyday, tried to serve both.Amazon, which changed how Americans shop much as Sears did in its prime, does not disclose what percentage of its stock is owned by employees.Not only does it reverse what had been an unusually broad employee stock ownership program, Amazon\u2019s decision underscores how lower-paid employees across corporate America have been locked out of profit-sharing and stock grants.\u201cWhat\u2019s happened is that shareholders\u2019 interests have squeezed out other stakeholders,\u201d said Arthur C. Martinez, who ran Sears during the 1990s and was credited with a turnaround. \u201cThe mantra is shareholders above all else.\u201dDecades ago, he said, \u201cthe people who produced or sold the product were more central than the people in the corporate suite. There was a different mind-set and it\u2019s linked to the larger issue of income inequality.\u201dNot only was Sears\u2019s program generous, it was also remarkably egalitarian. Contributions were based on years of service, not rank, and the longest-serving workers received nearly $3 for every dollar they contributed. The company phased out the profit-sharing plan beginning in the 1970s. This month, after years of lackluster attempts at revival, the retailer filed for bankruptcy protection.Companies like Procter & Gamble, S.C. Johnson, Hallmark Cards and U.S. Steel all embraced profit-sharing and were part of a corporate movement to encourage the practice, he said.Among some leading executives in the early to mid-20th century, Professor Blasi said, \u201cthere was a notion that wages were not enough and workers had a right to share in the fruits of their labor.\u201dIn the executive suite, however, profit-sharing still flourishes. While 68 percent of workers who earn more than $75,000 benefit from it, only 20 percent of workers earning less than $30,000 do, according to Professor Blasi. The decline of profit-sharing for the latter group has accelerated in recent years, with the median annual grant falling to $300 in 2014 from $921 in 2002.There are Amazon employees who hold a lot of stock. Four out of the top five executives earned less than $175,000 each in annual salary in the last three years, but got tens of millions of dollars in stock.By present-day standards, Amazon is relatively generous. In addition to 401(k)\u2019s, full-time employees receive medical insurance and a week of paid vacation their first year.Fifty years ago, Sears provided all of that plus a much larger annual retirement contribution. While the typical Amazon employee receives $680 from the company in a 401(k), the average Sears worker got the present-day equivalent of $2,744. Dividends on accumulated stock could add thousands annually.If Amazon\u2019s 575,000 total employees owned the same proportion of their employer\u2019s stock as the Sears workers did in the 1950s, they would each own shares worth $381,000.To make up for the lost stock grants, Amazon has provided raises of at least $1.25 an hour to employees who had been earning over $15, plus cash bonuses at five, 10, 15 and 20 years of employment. Employees can put 401(k) contributions into Amazon shares.Several employees interviewed, who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, expressed disappointment. Amazon should have saved the dollar and kept giving workers stock, said one warehouse employee in Baltimore.Amazon insisted workers were not losing out. \u201cThe significant increase in hourly cash wages effective Nov. 1 more than compensates for the phaseout of incentive pay and future stock grants,\u201d said a company spokeswoman, Ashley Robinson.The calculus was different at Sears, said Dan Fapp, a former communications executive who worked there from 1963 to 1999. \u201cIf the company did well and the stock went up, your account was worth more,\u201d he said.At stores, there were also opportunities for salespeople to increase their base salary through commissions. So-called Big Ticket Men, who sold more expensive goods, earned the equivalent of nearly $50,000 a year.Stanley Hreneczko, 91, started working at the Sears in Troy, Mich., in 1965. He was a salesman in the appliances department \u2014 selling stoves and refrigerators. Thanks to his generous pay and the corporate savings plan, Mr. Hreneczko bought a home in cash and took summer vacations to Arizona and Florida.\u201cIt was like working in heaven,\u201d he said.Even junior employees were well taken care of.\u201cMost of these people retired with a good pension,\u201d said Jon White, who worked at Sears for 38 years, most recently as a manager in a store in Lithonia, Ga., before retiring in 2008. \u201cMost of them are comfortable for the most part \u2014 cashiers, clerks, replenishers, all kinds of workers.\u201dEven after Sears scaled back its profit-sharing plan, workers benefited from a pension plan that held a diverse portfolio of stocks and bonds and provided fixed payments based on their salaries and tenure at the company. With Sears in bankruptcy, the federal government is expected to guarantee some or most of those pension payments.Unlike Sears, Amazon is growing rapidly and the company says it is working harder to increase opportunities for promotion from the warehouse floor into leadership positions.But its warehouses are staffed primarily by legions of lower-paid hourly employees. Of more than 2,000 workers at its fulfillment center in Carteret, N.J., all but 230 earn less than $17 an hour, or about $35,000 a year. During a recent tour there, one worker, Julia Teran, said she had received six shares during her three years at the company.\u201cI keep it for my retirement,\u201d Ms. Teran, 58, said of her stock, which is worth more than $10,000. How does she feel about the end of stock grants? \u201cThings change,\u201d she said with a half-smile.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bill Walker, Governor of Alaska, Suspends Campaign Amid Sinking Polls", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Bill Walker of Alaska, a political independent who has been fighting an uphill battle for a second term, suspended his campaign on Friday and announced he was throwing his support behind his Democratic challenger. With only a few weeks before the election, the announcement upended the race, which until now had three candidates.\u201cI believe we cannot win a three-way race,\u201d said Mr. Walker, a former Republican who left his party to win election as an independent in 2014. Mr. Walker said he had concluded that former United States Senator Mark Begich, a Democrat, \u201chas a better chance of running a competitive race\u201d against their Republican opponent, Mike J. Dunleavy, a well-financed Republican former state senator.\u201cAlaskans deserve a choice other than Mike Dunleavy,\u201d Mr. Walker said. He urged his followers to vote for Mr. Begich even though his own name will still be on the ballot.The announcement, which came as a shock to many, added chaos to a race in a pivotal time for the state. Alaska has struggled for years with a financial crisis in the capital, Juneau, and the next governor will face significant challenges. A recession has erased thousands of jobs as the oil industry, crucial to the economy, has slumped. Rising crime and homelessness have become major issues especially in Anchorage, the state\u2019s largest city.Even before Mr. Walker\u2019s announcement, his campaign was in disarray after the sudden resignation this week of the lieutenant governor, Byron Mallott, who left office after making unspecified comments that Mr. Walker described as \u201cinappropriate.\u201dFrom the start, Mr. Walker, 67, was not a conventional governor. As an independent, he had no party to back him in the Legislature, and over time he had irked some of his former allies. Though Mr. Walker had been a Republican, he served alongside a Democrat, Mr. Mallott. Mr. Walker also made many enemies among Republicans by defeating Gov. Sean Parnell, a Republican who had been seeking re-election in 2014.Complicating matters, control in Juneau already was split. Republicans dominate the State Senate, but a coalition led by Democrats controls the House of Representatives.Mr. Walker\u2019s term also saw struggles over taxes and a recession in Alaska. Most of Alaska\u2019s government is supported by taxes paid by the oil companies, and falling revenues have strained the budget. Mr. Walker cut spending but also proposed fees and taxes, including the restoration of a personal income tax in Alaska; the Legislature rejected that notion.As governor, Mr. Walker was careful not to burn bridges with Republicans in trying to get legislation passed. But in his statement to Alaskans on Friday, he was far less conciliatory. In a point-by-point analysis of Mr. Dunleavy\u2019s record and statements on campaign trail, Mr. Walker made it clear that he viewed Mr. Dunleavy as the wrong choice for the state on everything from taxes to health care.\u201cOn balance, it is my belief that despite my many differences with Mark Begich, his stance on the important issues I have listed above more closely align with my priorities for Alaska,\u201d Mr. Walker said.Mr. Begich, a former mayor of Anchorage, served one term in the United States Senate, and was narrowly defeated in 2014 \u2014 the same year Mr. Walker won office as governor \u2014 by Dan Sullivan, a Republican and the former state attorney general. Mr. Begich entered the race for governor in June of this year, complicating Mr. Walker\u2019s re-election plans from the beginning. Mr. Begich\u2019s candidacy raised hopes by Republicans that Democratic-leaning voters would be split between Mr. Begich and Mr. Walker, opening a path to victory for Mr. Dunleavy.Uncertain now was how voters might respond to Mr. Walker\u2019s departure. Would Republicans or independents who favored Mr. Walker turn to the Democrat? Would some people see Mr. Walker\u2019s name on the ballot and vote for him even though he has said not to?Early voting begins on Monday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is Medicare for All the Answer to Sky-High Administrative Costs?", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New Health CareIt would save money compared with private plans, but would also probably shed features that some might miss.Democrats say that giving people the option to partake in Medicare \u2014 no matter their age \u2014 will actually cut costs. Does that argument hold up? Medicare\u2019s direct administrative costs are not only low, but they also have been falling over the years, as a percent of total program spending. Yet the program\u2019s total administrative costs \u2014 including those of the private plans \u2014 have been rising. \u201cThis reflects a shift toward more enrollment in private plans,\u201d Mr. Sullivan said. \u201cThe growth of those plans has raised, not lowered, overall Medicare administrative costs.\u201dMaking an accurate estimate of the administrative costs of Medicare for All would depend, in part, on whether it would be more like an expansion of traditional Medicare (with its 1.1 percent administrative cost rate) or of all of Medicare, including its private plans (with a combined 7 percent administrative cost rate).This is true, but the government\u2019s administrative costs for Medicare are still below those of private plans. The government\u2019s administrative costs are about $132 per person compared with over $700 for private plans. One reason Medicare\u2019s are so much lower is that it reaps economies of scale. It also benefits from not needing to do much marketing, and it doesn\u2019t earn profits.A final critique of Medicare\u2019s administrative costs is that they\u2019re inefficiently low because the program doesn\u2019t spend enough on anti-fraud efforts. Still, even if Medicare did every bit as much in this area as the private sector, it would not raise its administrative costs by much. Although Medicare for All might shed some administrative costs, it could also shed some other features, including some that many people appreciate.\u201cWe should keep in mind that traditional Medicare and private plans are completely different products, and thus their associated administrative cost loads are very different,\u201d Mr. Naugle said.Traditional Medicare is primarily focused on processing payments to providers, while private plans \u2014 including those offered by Medicare Advantage, employers and Affordable Care Act marketplace plans \u2014 engage in care management, which could help coordinate care for people with chronic conditions. Private plans also establish networks of physicians, which could help steer enrollees to higher-quality providers.Another point in favor of private plans is that they\u2019re more responsive to consumer demand. For this reason, private plans have provided some benefits that Medicare hasn\u2019t \u2014 or provided them long before Medicare did.For example, drug coverage was commonplace in private plans well before Medicare put in a universal prescription drug benefit in 2006. Another is that traditional Medicare still doesn\u2019t have an out-of-pocket limit, whereas that\u2019s standard for private plans.But let\u2019s get back to the main question we posed at the top: Are Democrats right that Medicare\u2019s administrative costs are below those of private insurers? The answer is yes. But that\u2019s in part because private plans do things that Medicare doesn\u2019t. Whether those things are worth higher administrative costs is a value judgment on which reasonable people can disagree.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Uproar Over Dissident Rattles Saudi Royal Family", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 As international outrage grew at Saudi Arabia over the apparent killing of the Saudi dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul, an alarmed King Salman dispatched a senior royal to address the matter with Turkey\u2019s president.Prince Khalid al-Faisal returned home from Ankara with a bleak message for the royal family. \u201cIt is really difficult to get out of this one,\u201d Prince Khalid told relatives after his return, one of those family members recalled this week. \u201cHe was really disturbed by it.\u201dSaudi Arabia is facing perhaps its greatest international crisis since the revelation that its citizens planned and carried out the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.Members of the ruling family are increasingly worried about the direction of the country under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 33-year-old favorite son of King Salman and the kingdom\u2019s day-to-day ruler.But unlike 2001, when the royal family came together to protect its collective interests, this time that may not be possible. Instead, there is deep concern, as royals search, so far in vain, for a way to contain the crown prince, who has consolidated power so completely that nearly everyone else is marginalized.The one person who could intervene is the king himself, but senior princes have found it nearly impossible to bring their concerns to the 82-year-old monarch, and some doubt he is fully aware of what is happening or willing to change course.\u201cThe king has no capacity to handle it,\u201d said an employee of a senior prince, speaking on condition of anonymity, like others in this article, because of fear of repercussions.Speaking of Crown Prince Mohammed, he said, \u201cHe is No. 1 and No. 2.\u201dSince the Saudi state was founded in 1932, the royal family has at times been torn by disagreements, even an assassination. But the thousands of princes and princesses who make up the House of Saud have ultimately found ways to preserve the dynasty. There was simply too much at stake to let family rifts get in the way of lavish lifestyles, exorbitant allowances and unrivaled privileges.Then came Crown Prince Mohammed \u2014 young, brash and eager \u2014 who has systematically dismantled the system of consensus that kept the peace for decades.That pitch won over fans who saw him as exactly the kind of leader the kingdom needed to shake off its conservative past. Among those fans was the Trump administration, which made him the pillar of its Middle East policy.But his rise irked many of his cousins, who now fear the worst as they helplessly watch the kingdom\u2019s reputation become toxic.Turkish officials have said a 15-member hit team from Saudi Arabia was waiting for Mr. Khashoggi and dismembered him in the consulate. It seems unlikely that such an operation could have been undertaken without the crown prince\u2019s knowledge.Such a prospect has created something the prince\u2019s relatives thought they\u2019d never see: a problem they cannot buy their way out of. And none appear willing or able to match the young prince\u2019s Machiavellian tactics.\u201cThey aren\u2019t a particularly draconian bunch,\u201d said another longtime associate of the royal family, describing the philosophy of some princes as, \u201cWe just want to eat burgers and go on foreign holidays.\u201dAssociates of the royal family say that senior princes don\u2019t have the access to King Salman that they had to previous kings, making it hard to voice concerns. Some princes cannot enter the royal court or the king\u2019s palace unless their names have been placed at the door ahead of time, one member of the royal family complained.Otherwise, they see the king at official events where it is considered bad form to raise thorny issues or they visit him at night when he is playing cards, also a bad time for serious talk.At the same time, Prince Mohammed has been scrambling to mitigate the damage. One Western adviser said that even he had been taken aback by the outrage.\u201cHe was in real shock at the magnitude of the reaction,\u201d the adviser said.The palace turmoil has been reflected in Saudi Arabia\u2019s shifting explanations for what happened to Mr. Khashoggi. For weeks, the government officials insisted that he had left the Istanbul consulate shortly after he arrived and that they had no idea of his whereabouts.Early Saturday, the Saudi state-run news media said that Mr. Khashoggi had been killed in a fistfight in the consulate and that 18 unidentified Saudis were being held in connection with his death. It was the kingdom\u2019s first admission that Mr. Khashoggi was dead.The crown prince has steadfastly rejected the pleas of Wall Street executives to postpone an investor conference he is scheduled to host next week in Riyadh, even as one after another participant has canceled because of the scandal, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.Instead, the crown prince formed a crisis committee of representatives of the intelligence agencies, Foreign Ministry and security services to update him throughout the day on the latest in the Khashoggi scandal. He has recalled his younger brother, Prince Khalid bin Salman, the ambassador to Washington, accelerating plans to name him as a kind of national security adviser to bring order to what largely has been an ad hoc policy process.The terse announcement early Saturday that Mr. Khashoggi died inside the consulate during a fight appeared to be part of a strategy of acknowledging his death but shifting the responsibility away from the crown prince.Officials were known to have been weighing whether to blame Maj. Gen. Ahmed al-Assiri, the deputy head of intelligence and a confidant of the young prince. People with knowledge of the plan said it would accuse General Assiri of having orchestrated a plot intended to capture Mr. Khashoggi but that it ultimately killed him \u2014 an explanation the Saudis hope will help shield the crown prince from further recriminations.On Saturday, General Assiri was removed from his post, state media reported, along with at least three other high-level officials. It was not made clear whether the dismissals had any connection to the Khashoggi case.While Saudi Arabia was traditionally ruled by senior princes who divided major portfolios and made big policy decisions by consensus under the king, many of those once-powerful princes have seen their power cut. Some have been removed from prominent posts. Others were locked in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton last year on accusations of corruption made by Crown Prince Mohammed. Still others and their families are banned from travel and too scared they might be arrested to speak up.Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the previous crown prince and counterterrorism czar, remains under virtual house arrest. He, his wife and their two daughters found out earlier this year that their Saudi bank accounts had been drained, a relative said.The sons of the former king, Abdullah, who died in 2015, have been neutralized. One was removed as the head of the National Guard, accused of corruption and stripped of assets, including the horse track he inherited from his father. His brother, a former governor of Riyadh, is detained, as is another son of another former king. Yet another brother is hiding out in Europe, scared that he could be kidnapped and sent home.That leaves only the crown prince\u2019s father, King Salman, to check his power.\u201cThere is one person inside Saudi Arabia who can challenge Mohammed bin Salman, and it is the king,\u201d said Joseph A. Kechichian, a scholar at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Riyadh.But the king must consider not only the stain of the Khashoggi issue on his son\u2019s reputation, but also how to continue the reform program known as Vision 2030 that the crown prince has begun, Mr. Kechichian said.Others question whether the king\u2019s health allows him to grasp all that is happening.\u201cOne worries about the mental state of King Salman,\u201d said Madawi al-Rasheed, a visiting professor at the London School of Economics and author of many books on Saudi Arabia. \u201cIs he really in a position to make these decisions at this late age?\u201dRemoving such a powerful crown prince could prove hugely disruptive, and few princes would want the job with a resentful Mohammed bin Salman scheming against his replacement. But one Western diplomat with long experience in the kingdom suggested that the king might check the young prince by reducing his power, perhaps redistributing control of the security services to other respected princes.\u201cThe brand has been irreparably tarnished \u2014 domestically they really do need to do something to rein M.B.S. in,\u201d the diplomat said, referring to the crown prince by his initials. \u201cThey need to do something to corral him.\u201dOne of the few with the stature to urge the king to make such a shift might be Prince Khalid, who flew to Ankara to see the Turks. A son of the late King Faisal and now governor of Mecca Province, Prince Khalid, 78, is esteemed in the family as measured and intelligent. That the king sent him on such a touchy mission indicates that he already has the monarch\u2019s trust. His half brother, Prince Turki al-Faisal, was a longtime friend and patron of Mr. Khashoggi in the decades when he worked in the Saudi establishment before he turned critical of Crown Prince Mohammed.Some foes of the crown prince have hoped for a challenge for the throne from the king\u2019s brother, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz. Prince Ahmed, 73, is the youngest of seven sons of the late King Abdulaziz who all shared the same mother, Hussa bint Ahmed al-Sudairi. The Sudairi seven, as they were known, formed a powerful bloc within the family and passed the throne from brother to brother \u2014 a pattern that might have extended to Prince Ahmed if King Salman had not redirected the line of succession to his own son.So critics of Prince Mohammed were electrified last month when Prince Ahmed addressed protesters on the street in London who were chanting against the royal family over the war in Yemen.\u201cWhat does this have to do with the Al Saud?\u201d Prince Ahmed said, in comments caught on video. \u201cThose responsible are the king and his crown prince.\u201dWhen asked about the war in Yemen, he replied, \u201cI hope the situation ends, whether in Yemen or elsewhere, today before tomorrow.\u201dOn the internet, critics of the crown prince posted oaths of loyalty to Prince Ahmed, but his turn as an opposition leader did not last long. He soon issued a statement saying his comment had been misinterpreted. He remains in London, afraid to return home.Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, and David D. Kirkpatrick from Istanbul.

{"Headline": "Pakistan Seeks I.M.F. Bailout as Government Sends Mixed Messages", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe concern surrounding Pakistan\u2019s economic course and Mr. Khan\u2019s intentions has clearly left the I.M.F. skeptical, and the result may be a tough road ahead for the country if it is to get its bailout.The fund\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, insisted on Thursday that Pakistan provide \u201cabsolute transparency\u201d on its debts, many of which are owed to China as part of its Belt and Road construction program. Pakistan is a showcase for China\u2019s initiative, hosting up to $62 billion of Chinese investments, most financed by costly loans taken from Chinese state-owned banks.Any bailout for Pakistan would require \u201ccomplete understanding and absolute transparency about the nature, size, and terms of the debt that is bearing on a particular country,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said, as she prepared to meet the Pakistani delegation later Thursday at the I.M.F. and World Bank Group annual meetings in Bali, Indonesia.Later that day, the I.M.F. released a statement saying that Ms. Lagarde had met the Pakistani team and that the fund would send a team to Islamabad in the coming weeks to initiate discussions for a bailout program.Ahead of Pakistan\u2019s July elections, Mr. Khan promised to open up the books on Chinese investments and even cut projects that were unnecessary or too costly. Pakistan\u2019s previous government, led by ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, was harshly criticized for refusing to publicly disclose the financing terms and conditions around China\u2019s investments, leaving the country in the dark about exactly how much debt it has committed to repay.Although Pakistan faces an external debt burden of $8 billion this year, the first payments to China as part of the Belt and Road Initiative come due in 2019, with $1 billion owed, officials say. Pakistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves hit a four-year low last week, hovering at $8.4 billion according to the central bank. That is less than enough to cover even just two months of imports.\u201cGoing to the I.M.F. was inevitable. There was no other way out, not only to bridge the financing gap but to provide confidence to the markets,\u201d said Farrukh Saleem, the spokesman for Pakistan\u2019s Ministry of Economy.He added: \u201cEven if China had given $26 billion to Pakistan, it doesn\u2019t give confidence to the markets. It\u2019s not just about the bailout but getting into an I.M.F. monitoring program,\u201d which gives investors assurance that Pakistan is taking on needed economic reforms, allowing the country to tap other debt markets.Although Mr. Khan maintains that he will pursue both the I.M.F. bailout and loans from \u201cfriendly countries,\u201d those statements contradict the stance of both his finance minister and information minister, Fawad Chaudhry, who said that the conditions on those outside loans were unacceptable.\u201cWe spoke with the United Arab Emirates, China, Saudi Arabia and held consultations with other countries,\u201d Mr. Chaudhry said in televised remarks Tuesday. \u201cWe did not want to take the money the way it was being given to us.\u201dOn the campaign trail before the July elections, Mr. Khan championed austerity even as he promised to build an Islamic welfare state. The new project to build five million housing units is a signature part of his \u201cNaya Pakistan\u201d agenda \u2014 meaning New Pakistan \u2014 to kick-start the economy and provide support to the country\u2019s poorest.But going to the I.M.F. will likely mean cuts to those welfare state dreams.\u201cWith the I.M.F., there will be an impact on the government not fulfilling its election promises. But welcome to the real world,\u201d said Mr. Saleem, the economy ministry spokesman.The contradicting remarks coming out of Islamabad have left investors confused about how seriously Mr. Khan\u2019s government will commit to the I.M.F.\u2019s austerity terms. This would be the latest in at least 12 I.M.F. programs Pakistan has undertaken in the last few decades, failing to complete the structural reforms required in all but one bailout package.\u201cThis crisis could have been averted better if the government had declared their plan two months ago, when they came to power. Instead they gave mixed messages, leaving the markets guessing. A lot of damage could have been averted with timely clarity,\u201d said Ashraf Wathra, the former central bank governor under the previous government.While Mr. Wathra acknowledges that the previous government is at fault for the ballooning national debt, he says Mr. Khan should have taken the overwhelming advice from economists to go to the I.M.F. as soon as possible.This week, the Pakistani rupee fell as low as 137 to the United States dollar, shedding 10.2 percent of its value. The biggest ever one-day fall was in 1998, when the rupee fell 11 percent after Pakistan tested nuclear weapons.Pakistan\u2019s business community, and even ardent supporters of Mr. Khan\u2019s party, have also been angry at what many described as \u201cdithering\u201d ahead of the decision to go to the I.M.F.Farooq Sarwar, a Rawalpindi-based importer of food, toiletries and confectionary items, has said he has had to cut down on his stock, worried stores he supplies will close down as customers cut their spending as the rupee falls in value.\u201cThe dip in the dollar has affected the importers in a way that no one knows what to do right now,\u201d Mr. Sarwar said. \u201cWe had high expectations from the current government and thought they will take steps after taking people in to confidence. But it seems they had done no homework.\u201dSalman Masood contributed reporting from Islamabad, Pakistan, and Alexandra Stevenson from Hong Kong.Advertisement"}

He remembers thinking, \u201cThis road is a hidden natural resource for tourism and development.\u201dA similar strategy had worked for Deal\u2019s Gap, an area on the border between Tennessee and North Carolina. In the 1990s, local entrepreneurs branded a curvy stretch of road \u201cTail of the Dragon,\u201d boasting \u201c318 turns in 11 miles.\u201d It became an internationally known motorcycle and sports car tourist attraction.Mr. Davidson, now 70, noted that Route 16 rolled over three mountains and decided that \u201cBack of the Dragon\u201d made a pretty good name. He tested its marketing potential by printing a dozen dragon-logo T-shirts, putting them in a backpack, and then riding in search of motorcyclists who had stopped to admire the mountain vistas. He sold the entire lot of T-shirts in about a day, he said.Since then, Mr. Davidson has worked with regional tourism groups and elected officials to promote the drive. It appears to be working: Last year an estimated 60,000 motorcycle and sports car enthusiasts came through town, up from 16,000 in 2013, said David Woodard, the director of community development for Tazewell County. Four restaurants have opened on Tazewell\u2019s Main Street since 2017.Tazewell, population 4,240, is a prime example of a southwest Virginia coalfield town converting to what Chris Cannon, executive director of the economic development group Friends of Southwest Virginia, calls the creative economy. \u201cWe focus on natural and cultural assets,\u201d rather than coal, tobacco and lumber, he said. The area has a bluegrass music heritage trail, a crafts collective and outdoor activities like ATV riding, hiking, mountain biking and river running. \u201cWe as a region are trying to diversify,\u201d said Mr. Cannon. \u201cEveryone is trying to find their niche.\u201dMr. Davidson grew up in West Virginia\u2019s Canebrake coal camp, where the houses were owned by New River & Pocahontas Consolidated Coal Company \u2014 known to locals as \u201cPokey fuel.\u201d His father worked in the company\u2019s mines for 32 years. \u201cI had a Huck Finn life,\u201d said Mr. Davidson. He hunted squirrel, fished in the camp\u2019s creek, and was surrounded by a diverse group of miners who could be heard speaking their native Italian, Hungarian and German. \u201cThe people who lived in the camps were so colorful,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody knew everybody.\u201d His parents later moved to Tazewell, about 17 miles across the Virginia border.The mines had been the engine of prosperity since the 1880s, about the time the town of Tazewell was founded. There some grand houses still stand, many on the national historic register, and in 1904 it claimed to be the smallest town in America to have an electric trolley, which ran from the train station into town. By 1974, the trolley was long gone, and with coal in decline, the Tazewell train station closed too.Mr. Davidson left to join the Air Force in 1967, and returned in 1977 to try mining himself. That didn\u2019t last, and he joined the Army, which eventually sent him to Europe. The roads there planted a seed. \u201cWe\u2019d go down in Berchtesgaden and into Austria, Switzerland, Italy, in the Alps, and that was my experience with those roads,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what made me look at Back of the Dragon when I got back here.\u201dAfter his T-shirt experiment, Mr. Davidson called on an acquaintance of his sister\u2019s, Margie Douglass, the tourism director of Tazewell county. \u201cHe came into my office and had a humongous picture of a dragon, and was carrying his motorcycle helmet,\u201d Ms. Douglass said. Mr. Davidson told her about Tennessee\u2019s Tail of the Dragon. \u201cHe said, \u2018The Tail has nothing on this area. It just needs to be marketed,\u2019\u201d Ms. Douglass said. \u201cHe was so excited by it, it was hard not to get excited too.\u201dMs. Douglass introduced him to regional tourism development groups, eventually got a grant to print brochures, and helped get Route 16 officially designated Back of the Dragon by the Virginia legislature in 2012. It was an easy sell, said Morgan Griffith, a Republican congressman who helped guide the bill for his home district. \u201cThey are coming up with a lot of ideas that don\u2019t cost a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cYou get a couple of thousand people spending a little money in the community and it starts to add up.\u201dCommunity organizations also pitched in, such as Tazewell Today, a group of citizens dedicated to reviving Main Street. It\u2019s headed by Irma Mitchell, the proprietor of a restaurant called The Front Porch, and a resident for nearly 80 years. \u201cBack of the Dragon was the driving force,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bikes were coming through, but they were coming straight on through. We had to give them a reason to stop.\u201dModeling itself on the National Trust for Historic Preservation\u2019s Main Street America programs, the group raised money locally and sought grants regionally and federally. The group hired Hill Studio, a community-planning consultant in Roanoke, Va., which recommended physical improvements to Main Street, and Tazewell started holding events like an annual \u201cTrucks and Tractors\u201d gathering.The town also created a tax incentive program, now three years old, which offers any new business four consecutive years of abatement on several taxes, including real estate and personal property, if the business commits to stay an additional five years. \u201cIf you are going to build a building on virgin ground, that savings is astronomical,\u201d said Mr. Day, the city manager.The new establishments on Main Street include a microbrewery and a coffee shop. Just off Main are a doughnut trailer and a gas station converted to a made-to-order burrito stand. James Oliver, a local developer who is a partner in a Holiday Inn Express & Suites in nearby Lebanon, Va., said he was negotiating to put another hotel on Main street. The town\u2019s only accommodation now is the former jail, built in 1832, which has been converted to a two-room inn.The next scheduled construction on Main is Mr. Davidson\u2019s Back of the Dragon Welcome Center. Mr. Davidson, his partner and two out-of-town investors who remain anonymous have ordered a 5,000-square-foot building. He hopes to offer food services and \u2014 of course \u2014 dragon souvenirs.It will also offer a photo op: An area artist is carving a 12-foot-tall red-and-black dragon that will have amber LED eyes. \u201cYes, it\u2019s about the dollar, but it\u2019s not just about the dollar,\u201d said Mr. Davidson. \u201cI want other people to understand what is here is a jewel.\u201dA picture caption with an earlier version of this article misstated the name of the mountain at the start of the Back of the Dragon trail.

{"Headline": "Fed Plans to Continue Raising Rates, Despite Trump\u2019s Ire", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve\u2019s official account of its latest policy meeting, published Wednesday, does not mention any discussion of President Trump\u2019s demands that the Fed should stop raising interest rates.But it makes clear that Mr. Trump\u2019s economic policies are very much on the Fed\u2019s mind.Most Fed officials predicted in September that the Fed would raise its benchmark interest rate to a mildly restrictive level, above 3 percent, by the second half of 2019.\u201cIt\u2019s time to readjust the policy stance at least to neutral,\u201d Charles L. Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said Friday on CNBC. \u201cLet\u2019s see how the economy is performing at that point, and then we might have to do a little bit more after that.\u201dBut the Fed remains uncertain about its plans for the coming year, and one reason is that Fed officials also are concerned that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies could impede economic growth, the minutes said.The Fed has said Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, including tariffs on steel, aluminum and a wide range of Chinese goods, have not yet dented aggregate measures of economic growth.The Fed\u2019s overall tone remains bright and sunny. The economy is in the 10th year of one of the longest expansions in American history, and officials expect the good times to continue.The bottom line, the Fed said, was that the economy \u201cwas evolving about as anticipated.\u201d Spending is up, driven in part by the tax cut, and a few Fed officials said they saw evidence that companies were beginning to increase investment in response to the tax cut, although the minutes did not elaborate.Fed officials are paid to worry about potential economic problems, and the minutes include a familiar list: Increased disruptions to trade could weigh on growth; slower economic growth in the rest of the world could weigh on the United States; a shortage of workers could begin to increase inflation.But the minutes said these risks were roughly balanced by the potential for faster economic growth.Mr. Trump complained that the Fed is \u201craising rates too fast\u201d despite the low level of inflation.The president said he had not spoken directly about his concerns with the Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, adding, \u201cI\u2019m not happy with what he\u2019s doing because it\u2019s going too fast.\u201dSome liberal economists and advocates have also criticized the rate increases. Inflation remains around the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed regards as healthy, and Fed officials have said they see little sign or danger of an acceleration. Critics of the rate increases argue that encouraging continued economic growth would pull more people back into the labor force, and put more money into workers\u2019 pockets.Mr. Powell, for his part, has declined to respond directly to the president\u2019s attacks, saying only that the Fed would make policy decisions based on economic data, without regard to political considerations. But he has defended the trajectory of Fed policy, arguing that the central bank is trying to strike a balance between encouraging economic growth and maintaining control of inflation.Some former Fed officials have criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks.Mr. Powell\u2019s predecessor, Janet L. Yellen, said last week that it was \u201cnot a desirable thing\u201d for a president to comment on Fed policy. \u201cThere\u2019s no law against that, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wise.\u201dInvestors so far have discounted the influence of Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, but some analysts warn that the attacks are likely to intensify. \u201cOnce rates get to \u2018tightening\u2019 levels, we would expect the president to step up his attacks just like he has against drug prices, oil prices, unfair trade practices,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. Mr. Rupkey predicted that the attacks could make the Fed more reluctant to raise rates; other analysts argue that Mr. Trump could spur the central bank to demonstrate its independence by pressing ahead with rate increases.A quarter-point increase at the December meeting would leave the Fed\u2019s benchmark rate about half a point below the 3 percent level that most Fed officials regard as neutral, meaning that the level of interest rates would neither be stimulating nor discouraging economic growth.Most Fed officials expect to raise rates at least three times next year. That could push the benchmark rate into restrictive territory by the fall of 2019. The minutes said officials favoring such actions thought it might be necessary \u201cto reduce the risk of a sustained overshooting of the committee\u2019s 2 percent inflation objective or the risk posed by significant financial imbalances.\u201dMr. Powell and other Fed officials have emphasized, however, that there is considerable uncertainty about the exact point at which monetary policy would tilt into restrictive territory.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "I\u2019m an Asian-American Harvard Alumnus. Affirmative Action Works.", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI know it\u2019s incorrect to think of race-conscious admissions policies as helping just the lucky few. Dr. Rhew is a Harvard graduate and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley.In a federal court in Boston on Monday, a trial that could have major consequences for diversity on university campuses began. A group of Asian-American students have accused Harvard of discriminating against Asian-American applicants by rejecting them despite their higher numerical scores in favor of African-American and Latino students.Like many Asian-Americans and many Harvard graduates, I vigorously oppose the lawsuit. I reject the false equivalence of the argument that taking into consideration the race of applicants from underrepresented groups is the same as discriminating against everyone else.The plaintiffs are asking why colleges like Harvard should increase racial and ethnic diversity at the expense of \u201cmore qualified\u201d applicants, in particular Asian-Americans? The assumption here is that factors like an applicant\u2019s SATs, grade point average and number of extracurricular activities can provide a precise ranking of student quality. But that\u2019s not true. While scores and grades may provide a general measure of cognitive ability and motivation, no universal metric can exactly gauge applicants\u2019 intellect or their value to an institution.I would flip the question: Does the racial and ethnic diversity at Harvard enhance the quality of the education there? My answer is a resounding yes. The best college education includes intellectual and social interactions among thoughtful people from a broad range of cultural and racial backgrounds, both inside and outside the classroom. Restricting diversity efforts will ultimately reduce the quality of education.Berkeley is working hard to promote racial diversity among its undergraduate body, but it has a long way to go. The elimination of affirmative action hinders this progress. Still, the university is able to get students representing a wide range of interests, backgrounds and identities because it\u2019s so big (with over 30,000 undergraduates, it is almost five times the size of Harvard). Forbidding race as a factor in admissions would be a bigger blow to diversity at smaller universities, whose smaller student bodies limit the cross-section of the world that can be accommodated.Though I\u2019m a professor, I readily acknowledge that much of the learning occurs outside the lecture hall, in the spaces where students live and socialize. As an undergraduate at Harvard in the early 1990s, I spent countless late nights debating religion, science, culture and politics with classmates of a wide variety of belief systems, backgrounds, interests, political viewpoints, ethnicities and race. These interactions made my mental constructs of society more flexible, allowing me to incorporate new information and to learn from the experiences of others.Some ask why can\u2019t Harvard be more like Berkeley, eliminating an individual\u2019s race as a factor in admissions? As someone who knows both schools quite well, I take the opposite position, and wish Berkeley could be more like Harvard. If students are an integral part of the educational experience, then having a diverse class is essential. Only an admissions process that takes into consideration the whole person \u2014 including race \u2014 can produce the extraordinary diversity of each incoming class at Harvard.I once believed that affirmative action was primarily important as a vehicle to address the decades of racial inequality that have harmed minorities in the past, including Asian-Americans. I now recognize that the benefits of the racial and ethnic diversity that affirmative action produces are shared by everyone. When this diversity exists, stereotypes are shattered, arguments are informed by experience, and alternate perspectives lead to revelations. Race cannot and should not be excised from a person\u2019s identity, but communities can be built around shared undergraduate experiences and friendships among students with different backgrounds.The experiential learning environment provided by a diverse community is vital. Our students are the future professionals who will enter a diverse work force, the business leaders who will work in a global economy and the visionaries who will solve local and global problems. Perhaps most important, diversity is vital to educating citizens who can identify the artificial constructs that divide us and develop new relationships to move our society forward. A race-conscious admissions policy is not about benefiting the lucky few \u2014 it is about improving the educational experience for all.Robert Rhew is an associate professor in the departments of geography and of environmental science, policy and management at the University of California, Berkeley.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Is the Rust Belt Still Trump Country?", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats are leading in many high-profile races, but there are a lot of low visibility elections that carry exceptionally high stakes. Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.Democrats are poised to win every Senate and governor\u2019s race throughout the Midwest this November, and they are expected to pick up House seats in the region too.Let\u2019s take a look, first, at the big picture.Barring unforeseen events, Democrats in the region will make gains at every level on Election Day, from statewide contests to House elections to state legislative seats. Still, their gains in state legislative races may not prove to be enough to flip those bodies to Democratic control.It is at this level of legislative races \u2014 low visibility elections that carry exceptionally high stakes \u2014 that Democrats face intimidating Republican majorities. For Democrats to see across-the-board gains on the scale that Republicans achieved in 2010 would require not just a wave, but a tidal wave.It is difficult to overestimate the political importance of the Midwest. The region was not only crucial to Trump\u2019s victory, it has been crucial to continuing conservative control of both branches of Congress.Some interpreted 2016 as beginning of possible realignment of the Great Lakes Midwest, with the white working class leaving Democrats. But this year, Senate races in those states are not even competitive for Republicans.By far the Democrats\u2019 strongest region in Senate + Gov + House polling has been the Midwest, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d really gather that from the tonality of the reporting, which tends to fixate on demographic change and therefore finds races in the South & the West a lot sexier.According to both Democratic and Republican operatives, Republican difficulties in the region stem in part from the trend among many Obama 2012-to-Trump-2016 voters to switch back to the Democrats.Nick Gourevitch, whose Democratic firm, Global Strategy Group, is polling in the Midwest, wrote in an email: \u201cIn general, we are seeing Obama-Trump districts returning to the fold as competitive seats.\u201d He went on:Our postelection research on Obama-Trump voters showed that many of them were conflicted voters who had mixed feelings about supporting the president and that not all of them were the die-hard Trump supporters some in the media like to report them to be.Gourevitch\u2019s assessment is shared by a Republican consultant active in the region who requested anonymity to avoid alienating clients.His studies, and polling by others in the region, he wrote me by email, showthat a significant portion of the Trump vote was comprised of nose-holders \u2014 that is, voters who weren\u2019t particularly fond of Trump, but liked Hillary a helluva lot less, so they voted for Trump.\u201cThese voters have not transitioned into strong Trump supporters, but rather Trump doubters,\u201d the Republican consultant continued.They may like the policies he\u2019s espousing, but are turned off by his style of leadership. To say they are returning to the Democratic fold would be an overstatement because all the Democrats stand for is their opposition to Trump nowadays. Rather, these are swing voters \u2014 they voted for Trump, they may either not vote in \u201918 or may vote Democratic.The Republican consultant was less pessimistic about Trump\u2019s Midwestern prospects in 2020. The \u201cTrump doubters,\u201d he argues, are open for either side in \u201920. They are certainly still open for Trump, depending on who the Democrats put up. Trump\u2019s numbers may not be positive, but two years from now he may look at lot better than the candidate that survives the \u201clurch to the left\u201d Democratic presidential primaries.Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, agreed that while \u201cin 2018, Trump\u2019s victories in the Midwest are not paying off,\u201d Democrats should \u201cbe more wary of 2020. In the Midwest and nationally, Republicans and especially Trump are ahead on economy and trade. That\u200e could have real impact in 2020.\u201d More immediately, Lake cautioned, \u201cWe do need to watch men who seem to be moving toward Trump in this last week\u201d \u2014 referring to the aftermath of the bitter fight over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.A Democratic pollster who works on legislative races and who said he could be more candid if he remained anonymous, told me: We have a real problem with white working class voters heading into 2020. I don\u2019t think it protects GOP federal seats this year, but it protects Trump in 2020.In the coming election, the Republican consultant warned that there is \u201cno question that Republican state legislative bodies are at risk in November. If there is a serious blue wave, it won\u2019t stop at federal campaigns.\u201dA blue wave, however, will have to rise above a Republican breakwater. The State Senate and House districts in Midwestern states governed by the Republican Party after 2010 have been masterfully gerrymandered, and the Republican legislative majorities are now, with few exceptions, huge.We will definitely win seats across the Midwest but I am unsure if we will flip bodies. The 2010 and 2014 cycles were devastating for the party, especially legislatively, and a not very good 2016 did not help. Gerrymandering is a big factor.Take Ohio. In 2009, before the 2010 Republican wave election, Democrats controlled the State House by 53-46Hard numbers demonstrate the scope of the regional shift.In 2009, Democrats held the majority of state legislative seats in Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania, 343 to 320, a 23-seat advantage. In 2018, Republicans control 415 seats to the Democrats\u2019 245, a 170-seat advantage. (The smaller total in 2018 results from vacancies}.In 2009-11, Democrats had the majority of Midwestern states\u2019 congressional seats, 40-29. Today, the region sends 40 Republicans to the House and 25 Democrats. (The region lost seats because of population declines.)If Democrats were to succeed in winning not only governorships but complete control of a state\u2019s legislature, they would have the power to redraw congressional and legislative districts in their favor after the 2020 census, just as Republicans did after the 2010 census. If Republicans can keep control of at least one branch of a legislature, they will have power to block Democratic gerrymandering and force compromise.Similarly, Democrats would need complete control if they intend to rescind the many Republican-enacted laws designed to restrict and constrain voting by minorities.Until this year, Republicans and conservative groups invested much more heavily in state legislative contests than Democrats and their allies.This year, for the first time in recent memory, Democratic and liberal organizations are investing heavily in the battle for state legislatures.Republicans readily concede the success of the current Democratic mobilization at the state legislative level. In fact, Republicans use the threat of Democratic victory as a fund-raising tool.\u201cThey have been extremely effective in mobilizing their resources,\u201d Matthew Walter, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee, told me in a phone interview. After years of neglect, he added, \u201cthe fear of death\u201d has finally captured Democrats\u2019 attention.Walter argues that the strength of the Democratic surge in 2017 \u2014 when the party won 56 of 98 special elections and a special Senate election in Alabama \u2014 has waned this year. So far in 2018, Republicans have won a bare majority of special elections, 38 out of 75, according to Walter.David James, a spokesman for the committee, argues that Democratic special election victories have only made a tiny dent in the 1000 state legislative seats Republicans gained from 2010 to 2016: \u201cSo while the Democrats make headlines on flipping some seats, since 2016 they have regained only about 4 percent of their losses.\u201dIn the four key Rust Belt states Trump carried, the sole legislative chamber clearly vulnerable to Democratic takeover is the 33-member Wisconsin State Senate, which now has 18 Republicans and 15 Democrats. Seventeen of its members are up for election this year.The size of the Democratic advantage in the fight for control of the House is unclear with a month until the midterm elections, and there are recent signs Republicans might have improved their position, possibly because of the fight over Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to the Supreme Court.Trump has been highly effective in simultaneously building a resolute army of supporters and an equally determined cadre of voters who can\u2019t stand him. One crucial pillar of his political success has been the vacuity of his Democratic opposition.The Democratic grass roots, however, have been out in full force this fall, equipped with the most powerful of political motivations: rage, fear and anger. Republicans are also mobilizing in force.The Democrats may do well in 2018 by capitalizing on animosity to Trump, but that guarantees nothing for 2020. In fact, Democratic gains this year could serve to give Republicans the edge in the rage, fear and anger department.In our polarized politics, the winning side in one election is very likely to be the underdog in the next. No matter what happens in November, one thing is certain: For the Democrats to beat Trump in 2020, they will need a tough candidate prepared for battle in what has become politics without rules, boundaries or mercy.Advertisement"}

It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L. Whitfield sermonized from the Gospel According to John. In one of the pews they built a dollhouse out of Bibles. Pastor Whitfield was baptized in the bayou that runs behind the church 54 years ago.

That is partly because tools to make ads for \u201cStories\u201d are not fully developed yet, and it is easy for users to ignore ads on the service or skip the service altogether, analysts said.The company will also continue to invest in solving problems relating to issues such as misinformation and user privacy.Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that the move would hurt financial growth. \u201cWe have great products people love, but it will take us some time to catch up,\u201d he said. \u201cOur revenue growth will be slower.\u201dSome people still see light at the end of the tunnel, however:\u201cRight now, G.E. is in a real trough, and it looks like the business is collapsing,\u201d said Richard Keck, president of the Keck Group International, a power plant consultant. \u201cBut if they don\u2019t panic, it will come back.\u201d\u201cBy 2022,\u201d he added, \u201cwhoever is leading the G.E. power business might well be a hero.\u201dThe shipping company said yesterday that it had shut down a discount program for members of the National Rifle Association. FedEx said it wasn\u2019t a response to the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, but because the partnership didn\u2019t bring in enough business.The company had faced pressure from gun-control activists to end the program, in particular after a gunman killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Fla., in February. At the time, companies including Delta, United Airlines, MetLife and several car-rental outlets dropped deals with the N.R.A.But FedEx had refused to do so. In February, the company said that while it opposed civilian ownership of assault rifles, it \u201cdoes not and will not deny service or discriminate against any legal entity regardless of their policy positions or political views.\u201dA single number could unsettle China\u2019s economy in the coming weeks.

I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.The fight over Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh was supposed to be about a seat on the Supreme Court.But the past two weeks have transformed that discrete political battle into something far larger: A simmering war of the sexes that\u2019s deepening the divide between Democratic women and Republican men.The battle over Judge Kavanaugh is perhaps our starkest reflection of that new political reality.Let\u2019s think through these new dynamics with a little thought experiment:In a twist that will surprise no one, both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton addressed the confirmation battle in public appearances today, just an hour or so apart. (Yes, we\u2019re all caught in an episode of Black Mirror where we can never, ever escape the 2016 election. Just accept it. It\u2019s easier that way.)When asked by reporters if he had a message for men, Mr. Trump said:\u201cIt\u2019s a very scary time for young men in America, when you can be guilty of something that you may not be guilty of. This is a very, very \u2014 this is a very difficult time. What\u2019s happening here has much more to do than even the appointment of a Supreme Court justice.\u201dMrs. Clinton had a different take, one that reflects the thinking of many in her party.\u201cI think what is happening is that on many many fronts, women, young women and girls, are saying, \u2018You have to hear our stories, too. We have the right to be heard,\u2019\u201d she said, speaking at an event hosted by The Atlantic magazine. \u201cI don\u2019t see it so much as some kind of conflict, as finally righting the balance.\u201dMeanwhile, the F.B.I. is investigating, trying to figure out what actually happened on that summer night so many decades ago. It\u2019s hard to imagine a conclusive ending. The reality is that both Judge Kavanaugh and Dr. Blasey could be telling their truths. Maybe one is misremembering what happened. Maybe one is lying. It almost doesn\u2019t matter.The universality of their interaction \u2014 both for men and women \u2014 has tapped into something that\u2019s not likely to be resolved with a Senate vote.____________________We talked on Slack, which is the way a lot of conversations tend to happen at The New York Times.____________________Here\u2019s the latest in the ever-developing case:_____________________________________________________________Thanks for reading.

It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic.

{"Headline": "The Oil Industry Is Enjoying a Boom, but Will it Last?", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The good times are back. Or are they? The money is rolling in once again for the international oil giants after a grim period of budget cuts and job reductions following the plunge in oil prices in 2014. The profitability of major oil companies now approaches or, by some measures, exceeds the levels before the crash.For eight of the world\u2019s largest oil companies including, ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and Royal Dutch Shell, combined free cash flow, a measure that tracks the money going in and out of company coffers, was $30.9 billion in 2017 \u2014 far higher than the $3.8 billion recorded in 2014, when oil prices were far higher, according to Bernstein Research.That was after paying a rich $46 billion in dividends to shareholders.The reasons for the fatter numbers: A combination of higher prices for Brent crude and a continuing squeeze on spending. There has also been a changing of the guard with executives like Michael Wirth of Chevron; Patrick Pouyann\u00e9 of the French company Total and Ben van Beurden at Royal Dutch Shell, who worked in the less glamorous and more cost-conscious refining and petrochemicals units of companies, taking the reins and bringing a more tightfisted mentality to finding and developing new oil fields. In the $100-a-barrel era, in contrast, a \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d approach prevailed.\u201cYou definitely have a different culture permeating through these organizations,\u201d said Oswald Clint, an analyst at Bernstein in London. The current group of chief executives is more \u201cfocused on cost-cutting and not just building fancy toys,\u201d he said.Along with the bitter experience of low prices, concern about the role of fossil fuels in climate change is also influencing industry behavior.While demand for oil has been growing strongly in recent years, the question is whether it will continue to grow as governments and societies demand a shift to a low-carbon economy that may only be achievable by reducing use of emissions-spewing fossil fuels. While the Trump administration may be trying to roll back regulation of energy producers, oil executives fear that future administrations may reapply the rules even more aggressively.Pondering uncertainties like these, company boards are wary of approving the long term, multibillion dollar projects that used to be oil industry staples. \u201cHow do you approve these massive projects which have a 20-year life when you don\u2019t know what the business environment will be in 20 years?\u201d Mr. West asked.In this environment of uncertainty, investors also want quick payoffs in terms of higher and higher dividends and share buybacks.The contretemps creates an existential problem for the oil industry and for society as well.With only a small fraction of global energy needs met by renewables like wind and solar, oil and gas seem likely to remain important fuels for decades. \u201cI don\u2019t think oil will be under pressure for the next 30 to 40 years,\u201d Claudio Descalzi, chief executive of the Italian company Eni, said, while acknowledging that the industry must eventually slash emissions.Yet, government and societal pressures on the oil business seem likely to increase, potentially discouraging investment in new finds that may be needed to satisfy demand. Julie Wilson, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting firm, said exploration spending plummeted to $35 billion last year, from $94 billion in 2014.Ms. Wilson said chief executives now were focusing more on finding oil near existing installations, which could quickly be developed, as well as other activities like squeezing more oil out of existing fields \u2014 all of which produce relatively quick paybacks without making giant discoveries.\u201cExplorers, by their nature, push the boundaries of what is possible,\u201d she said, citing the Gulf of Mexico, where explorers testing the limits of technology found oil at staggering water depths. \u201cThere is little appetite for that kind of exploration now; oil prices and budgets don\u2019t support it,\u201d she added.The message seems to be that it is better to take cash now and turn the management attention and long-term risk for the coming decades over to someone else. \u201cChevron regularly reviews its global portfolio to ensure assets continue to meet our criteria for investment,\u201d the company said in a statement.The 470,000 acres acquired in Texas and elsewhere comes with very little risk, in the view of executives. Thanks to the work of BHP and others, they already know that the oil is there. Using finely honed techniques they can drill thousands of wells on the land in an almost industrial manner.The shale wells will produce oil far more quickly than the years required to set up a deepwater oil project or a liquefied natural gas facility, reducing exposure to price fluctuations and, therefore, soothing the worries of investors and boards. \u201cThere is essentially zero underground risk, \u201c said Dave Lawler, chief executive of BP\u2019s Lower 48, or shale, business.While shale used to be the realm of smaller oil companies known as independents, most of BP\u2019s rivals, including Exxon Mobil and Chevron, are now moving in, spending hefty portions of their capital on shale.Many see Mr. van Beurden of Shell as a chief executive who embodies the attributes needed in the industry. Mr. van Beurden, who became chief executive in 2014, knows that the oil and gas business remains vital to a company like Shell. He improved middling financial performance by buying a British energy company called BG for $54 billion in 2016 when oil prices were low, bringing in a rich portfolio of liquefied natural gas, a fast-growing fuel that has a lower carbon footprint than oil. BG brought oil, too, mostly in Brazil.Mr. van Beurden also recognizes that his company will be in trouble unless it convinces society and governments that it wants to be part of the solution to climate change, not the problem. He has gradually been placing bets on businesses \u2014 a solar company in California, a utility in Britain, an electric car-charging outfit in the Netherlands \u2014 intended to reduce the overall carbon content of the energy Shell sells.The key, he said, in an earlier interview, was ensuring that the company remained relevant in the future.\u201cUnderstanding how this energy transition is going to play out,\u201d Mr. van Beurden said, \u201cand how we are going to respond is actually the main strategic question.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "What Do I Owe My Severely Disabled Parents?", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe EthicistA little over two years ago, my family was involved in a catastrophic car accident overseas. My younger sibling was killed, and my parents survived but are severely disabled. My father is quadriplegic, while my mother has a traumatic brain injury resulting in severe cognitive impairment.My spouse and I were overseas for several months with my parents before they stabilized and were evacuated back to the United States. Then, over the next year (we don\u2019t live in the same city) we traveled to their city often to help manage transitions from the hospital to rehab, to where they are now (both live with 24-hour care). My extended family lives entirely abroad and, for the most part, does not speak English. Therefore, I also help (and plan to help for the rest of my parents\u2019 lives) to manage all of their financial and administrative matters, including trusts that I helped set up, applying for benefits, taxes, etc.My father\u2019s parents have reacted to his disability with the attitude that it is my duty to do everything he is unwilling to do (or ensure that someone else does it), and they believe it is appropriate for me to move to his city to manage his day-to-day affairs and for me to care-take emotionally for him to spare him further pain (e.g., for me to arrange all matters relating to my sibling). They have not expressed gratitude for my actions over the past two years except to praise my paperwork and administrative skills.My feeling is that I have put on hold my own grief and emotional needs (not to mention the money and time spent and career opportunities lost) to manage this situation and also try to arrange for my father the best quality of life possible. Yet he refuses to come to terms with his disability, including refusing to use assistive devices and skills he learned in rehab.Your life matters, and part of the challenge of making a good life is to balance your own needs, projects and interests against your obligations to others. Plainly, you have done a great deal for your parents, and, despite their ideas about the Dutiful Child, they are not entitled to further derail your life. Perhaps if you and your father had a better relationship, as you say, you would have been willing to do more. But your father has played a role, then and now, in your disaffection. The accident has dealt your parents\u2019 lives a devastating blow; if your own life were to be sacrificed in service of their care, the accident would have claimed another victim.And an ethical one. The point of accommodations is that, as the saying goes, tests should measure abilities, not disabilities. In many realms, processing speed is hardly relevant (there\u2019s no great advantage to the speedy sonneteer); in other realms, it\u2019s obviously critical (a truck driver can\u2019t ask for extra time in deciding whether to brake). And in your field? Your view is that developed talent may involve being able to work at a certain rate, not just getting the right answer in the end. Someone who solves a lot of problems in an hour is, in one obvious respect, better at problem-solving than someone who takes much longer. In many jobs, I\u2019ll grant, intellectual productivity matters; and productivity is a matter not just of what you do but how soon you get it done.Inevitably, there are debates over whether accommodations make things fairer or less fair. Since the major testing companies announced, at the beginning of this century, that they would no longer flag test scores obtained with special accommodations, the number of students receiving those accommodations increased significantly. Accommodations are, of course, easier to get if you\u2019re well-off and can afford to find and pay a psychologist who will diagnose a condition that entitles you to special treatment. (A College Board study suggests that nearly all students, not just disabled ones, do better on their SATs with extended time, especially in math.) In a California study from 2013, researchers concluded, \u201cHigher rates of A.D.H.D. observed in affluent, white families likely represent an effort by these highly educated parents to seek help for their children who may not be fulfilling their expectations for schoolwork.\u201d In short, the system can be exploited.But these concerns must take their place among others. As an ethical matter, we ought to treat everyone with such a diagnosis as if it\u2019s real. Anything less would be unfair to all of those with genuine disabilities. And let\u2019s remember the upside of the new regime as well. Thousands and thousands of young people who would have failed in college or been denied places altogether are now getting educations that allow them to contribute more to the economy and to make more meaningful lives as well.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Rick Scott and Bill Nelson Mount Fierce Attacks in Florida Senate Debate", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIRAMAR, Fla. \u2014 The rancorous tone of one of the country\u2019s most closely contested Senate races turned more hostile on Tuesday as Senator Bill Nelson of Florida cast his opponent, Gov. Rick Scott, as an untrustworthy liar in their first debate, while Mr. Scott portrayed Mr. Nelson as an ineffective failure.In an hourlong exchange aimed at the state\u2019s crucial Latino voters, Mr. Scott, a Republican, and Mr. Nelson, a Democrat, sharply disagreed on their records on Puerto Rico, immigration and health care. But almost every one of their answers invariably returned to their prepared lines of attack.\u201cThe governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another,\u201d Mr. Nelson said after Mr. Scott accused him of liking high taxes. \u201cApparently you never got your mouth washed out with soap after telling a lie.\u201dAfter Mr. Nelson spoke of his efforts for comprehensive immigration reform, Mr. Scott noted that the senator was in office when Democrats controlled the White House, Senate and House of Representatives.\u201cCongress has failed to act, failed to act, failed to act,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cHe never got anything done.\u201dThe debate showed that Mr. Scott continues to approach the competitive race as an underdog, despite his broad name recognition and financial advantage. He delivered forceful responses to questions even when they did not play to his chief strength, the economy. Mr. Nelson seemed at ease, with a steady, deliberate performance, though he appeared to miss opportunities to tie the governor to President Trump.The debate, taped at the studios of Miami\u2019s Telemundo affiliate, was unexpectedly lively for two candidates who are not known for their political charisma. That they had rehearsed crisp responses was apparent all the way to the end, when both men delivered prepared closing statements in passable Spanish. They are scheduled to debate only once more, on Oct. 16 in Tampa.A question about Mr. Trump\u2019s embattled nominee to the United States Supreme Court, Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, prompted Mr. Nelson to say he found Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s testimony last week \u201cquite compelling.\u201d Dr. Ford said she was sexually assaulted years ago by Mr. Kavanaugh, who has forcefully denied the accusation.\u201cAnd she was doing that in front of 11 Republican men that seemed to dismiss it,\u201d he said.\u201cThe way the U.S. Senate has handled this, it\u2019s a circus,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s more like a \u2018Jerry Springer Show.\u2019 Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh are just pawns in some political game.\u201dMr. Scott, who was elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014 with a relentless jobs message, has kept the Senate race close in part thanks to his direct appeals to Hispanic voters, and not only to Cuban-Americans in South Florida who lean Republican. He has also made repeated outreach to non-Cuban Hispanics, especially Puerto Ricans in Central Florida who tend to vote Democratic but are generally grateful to the governor for his visible presence on the island after Hurricane Maria last year.Still, it was Mr. Nelson who won the endorsement on Monday of Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, Ricardo A. Rossell\u00f3, who called Mr. Scott a friend but said Mr. Nelson had been helpful to the island even before the hurricane.On Tuesday, Mr. Nelson vaunted Mr. Rossell\u00f3\u2019s support and slammed the Trump administration\u2019s Maria response, referring to the day when Mr. Trump tossed paper towels to storm victims, a gesture that many Puerto Ricans found distasteful in the wake of the disaster.\u201cHe said, quote, \u2018I would not have done anything differently,\u2019\u201d Mr. Nelson said of Mr. Scott.\u201cDistancing yourself from President Trump \u2014 would that guarantee the Puerto Rican vote in Florida?\u201d Jackie Nespral, a debate moderator from the local NBC affiliate, asked Mr. Scott.\u201cI don\u2019t think of politics that way,\u201d he said. \u201cI think about, how do you help families? Whether they\u2019re in Puerto Rico, whether they came here, or whether they went back, my job is to be a full-service governor.\u201dMr. Scott was careful not to invoke Mr. Trump, who polls show remains deeply unpopular among Puerto Ricans. Surprisingly, however, Mr. Nelson also did not mention the president by name, though in campaign ads in Spanish he has tried to tie the president to the Florida governor, who chaired a fund-raising committee for Mr. Trump during the 2016 election.Both candidates denounced a Trump administration program, since rescinded, that separated children who came into the country illegally from their parents. \u201cWhen that was happening, my opponent was silent,\u201d said Mr. Nelson.He said that, in 2010, Mr. Scott had favored adopting harsh statewide immigration policies, including proposed legislation requiring local law enforcement to help enforce immigration laws. (Mr. Scott had also favored an even stronger provision that would subject employers to fines if they failed to verify employees\u2019 immigration status; he has since adopted a softer immigration position.)On the family separation issue, Mr. Scott said, \u201cI completely disagree with the president, and my opponent should have gone back to D.C. and got something done.\u201dOn health care, Mr. Nelson focused on Mr. Scott\u2019s opposition to expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which the governor has favored repealing. Mr. Scott said he would keep insurance protections contained in the law for pre-existing medical conditions.\u201cEither he made it up or tried to make people uncomfortable,\u201d Mr. Scott said.The senator offered no response.\u201cThe governor continues to bring up issues to try to deflect from his record,\u201d Mr. Nelson said, in a deflection of his own.Advertisement"}

The danger that Italian banks could become victims of their government\u2019s war of words with the European Commission.All these risks have helped roil stock markets in recent days, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, acknowledged on Thursday.But none of those hazards were enough to budge Mr. Draghi or the bank\u2019s Governing Council from their conviction that the eurozone economy is fundamentally solid.That message \u2014 that the eurozone economy is growing less briskly, but is not on the verge of recession \u2014 was perhaps the main point of Mr. Draghi\u2019s news conference in Frankfurt after a meeting of the bank\u2019s Governing Council.The council left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at zero and made no changes to its timetable for slowly withdrawing economic stimulus.Here are the main takeaways from the news conference:But he attributed some of the weakness to one-time factors, such as the introduction of new European Union emissions standards that proved tougher than expected for auto manufacturers to meet. Deliveries slumped because the carmakers had trouble getting regulators to approve new models for sale.The eurozone is simply returning to normal after an exceptionally strong 2017, when the economy expanded 2.3 percent, Mr. Draghi argued. \u201cWe are talking about a weaker momentum, not a downturn,\u201d he said.\u201cI am confident that an agreement will be found,\u201d Mr. Draghi said. He added, however, that he had no inside information about how a compromise might look. He also said neither he nor the central bank would play a mediating role in the dispute.And Mr. Draghi acknowledged that Italian banks could be swept up in the political turmoil because they owned lots of Italian government bonds. If the value of the bonds decreases, as it has been, the banks\u2019 capital erodes. If the banks fall short of capital, they may be shunned by financial markets.But Mr. Draghi declined to go into detail about what the central bank might do to help the banks if the situation in Italy worsens.But the risk that a bubble could pop and cause a crisis is lower because banks are not overly indebted as they were when the last financial crisis began in 2008. \u201cThe private financial sector is not overleveraged,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.\u201cWe still have tools in our toolbox,\u201d Mr. Draghi said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "An Election About Everything", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Politics With Lisa LererHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.In 2014, pundits, strategists and reporters dubbed the midterms the \u201cSeinfeld election\u201d \u2014 as in, an election about nothing.Those midterms, the thinking went, had no overriding theme, no sweeping Democratic plan for the middle class, no big G.O.P. proposal to slash spending.Four years later, the exact opposite feels true: President Trump has turned 2018 into an unpredictable, and often uncomfortable, election about the most divisive issues in American life.The past two weeks have only served to underscore that intensity.Traditionally, this kind of unrest should play to Republicans, who have long positioned themselves as the party of law and order. And, typically, the incumbent party benefits during national crises.But that\u2019s assuming the White House is handling the sense of anxiety in a unifying way. In the 48 hours after the synagogue shooting, Mr. Trump did not do any of the things Americans expect of their presidents in these kind of moments. He did not deliver an address calling for harmony, meet with faith leaders, introduce new policies or console the victims. In fact, he didn\u2019t even pause his campaign, the standard response to tragedy.On Monday afternoon, the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that Mr. Trump and his wife would travel to Pittsburgh to meet with the Jewish community \u2014 but she blamed the media for the toxic political climate that led to the attack.That leaves us in fairly uncharted waters, politically. It\u2019s part of the reason that strategists from both parties are urging candidates to stick to their messages.In Houston, Democratic volunteers told our Texas correspondent, Manny Fernandez, that recent events have been a source of sadness, anger and what one volunteer described as \u201crenewing the spirit to work harder.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s instilling a very strong sense of urgency, that we must have leaders who symbolize respect, integrity and honesty,\u201d said Nancy Nichols, a volunteer for the Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke in the East Texas city of Tyler.But will these past few weeks drive even more Democrats to the polls? Or remind those all-important suburban women of the kind of divisive rhetoric they don\u2019t particularly like to hear from the president? Or convince Republicans that the president is being treated unfairly by the media?____________________If Texas ever turns blue, the Texas Organizing Project \u2014 or TOP \u2014 will almost certainly have something to do with it.Last month I visited their Dallas headquarters, a bare-bones office in a strip mall off an expressway. I was curious to learn more about their efforts to turn out low-income voters in neighborhoods that have become disenfranchised \u2014 areas politicians avoid because of their low turnout, making residents even less inclined to vote, until whole communities are left out of politics altogether.What does that mission look like up close? The day I arrived, about 80 people in blue T-shirts sat in chairs, listening to a pep talk before heading out to knock on doors. Many of them had found their way to TOP through fliers that advertised $15-an-hour work. But once they were hired, trainers underscored a sense of political urgency and possibility.\u201cWe\u2019re knocking on doors of people that look just like us,\u201d a man told the group. \u201cEvery conversation matters. This is not just a job.\u201dIt usually takes three connections \u2014 a door knock, a call and an offer of a ride to the polls \u2014 to make sure a low-frequency voter actually casts a ballot.In a small nearby room, Shetamia Taylor, a charismatic canvas manager, called on people to practice their scripts, giving pointers about how to generate rapport. Listening was key. Only after a conversation, she said, did you tell voters that \u201cBeto O\u2019Rouke understands the issues,\u201d or that John Creuzot, a district attorney candidate, is \u201con our side.\u201dA paper on the wall reminds Ms. Taylor\u2019s group of their goals over the next two weeks: knock on 8,905 doors; get 1,188 commitments to vote. They are but one piece of a much larger project that aims to reach 72,000 doors in Dallas County before the midterm election, in order to turn out 26,000 infrequent voters.To organizers like Kimberly Olsen, the political field director who helped establish the organization, turning Texas blue is not a mysterious or elusive goal. It simply boils down to math. This year, she said, the numbers may not add up for Democrats outside of the big cities. But someday they could get there.\u201cWe need to be in nine counties,\u201d Ms. Olsen said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re in three.\u201d____________________In the last few weeks, we\u2019ve polled 14 of the 29 G.O.P.-held districts that are rated as tossups by the Cook Political Report. The average result is a tie. For 10 of the 14, the margin is one percentage point or less.You can see all our polling here._________________________________________________________________________________Thanks for reading.

{"Headline": "Turbocharging Jumps From Racetrack to Cul-de-Sac", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWheelsWhen an engineer suggested installing a supercharger into one of Walter Owen Bentley\u2019s cars to give it more power for the 24 Hours of Le Mans road race, the British industrialist bristled. He believed in only one way to make his 4.5-liter Bentleys go faster: Make the engines even bigger.\u201cThere\u2019s no replacement for displacement,\u201d Mr. Bentley famously announced 90 years ago. He was referring to the historical automotive equation that more \u201cair\u201d inside an engine\u2019s metal block, and more pistons in that block to pump the power to the wheels, were the keys to speed.A supercharged version found its way into the \u201cBlower Bentley\u201d in the 1920s, even though the stubborn Mr. Bentley insisted its function was only to \u201cpervert\u201d the engine design and \u201ccorrupt its performance.\u201dFast-forward nearly a century, and welcome to the era of the ubiquitous turbocharger, which is the fashionable version of forced induction.Unlike the supercharger, which is mechanically driven by the engine, the modern turbo is essentially a small turbine attached to the engine, driven by exhaust gases, that forces more air into the combustion chamber. Most industry experts expect that by 2027, more than half the vehicles sold in the United States will be powered by one.Because of the pressures put on car and truck makers to meet federal regulations \u2014 to increase fuel efficiency and reduce carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 the future of the automobile is turbocharged almost by default. Advancements in turbo technology, materials and efficiency are being developed to make the transition from your father\u2019s gas-guzzling Oldsmobile to today\u2019s fuel-sipping Honda as seamless as possible.Automakers that have embraced turbo tech \u2014 that\u2019s most of them \u2014 claim improvement of up to 30 percent over formal mileage estimates from the Environmental Protection Agency.\u201cIt\u2019s a global phenomenon,\u201d said Craig Balis, chief technology officer at Garrett Motion, one of the major suppliers of turbochargers, which until this month was part of Honeywell.\u201cIf you look at the maturity we have now as opposed to 10 years ago, all methodologies are improved: aerodynamics, exhaust streams, thermal management,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd there are advances in control technologies\u201d \u2014 like variable geometry, so-called V.N.T. \u2014 that Garrett says improves thermal efficiency and emissions in the next generation of gasoline turbo engines.While most consumers may be agnostic about the machinery that whirs and whines under the hoods of their vehicles, automakers cheer the turbo advance despite the gremlins that bedevil the process: turbo lag, or hesitation, when a driver accelerates, and the high heat generated by the spinning turbos. Still, many of the problems associated with turbocharging in decades past \u2014 the special maintenance, the oil consumption, the need to idle the engine before shut-off \u2014 have been solved.\u201cIn normal customer operating conditions, the fuel economy benefit is certainly there,\u201d Mr. Damen said. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t observed any limiting factors that would prohibit use of turbochargers\u201d in any General Motors engine.Turbocharging is among the few high-priority items on the agendas of both G.M. and its crosstown rival, Ford.\u201cSomething that was niche 15 years ago we at Ford have made mainstream,\u201d said Dave Filipe, the company\u2019s vice president for global powertrain engineering. \u201cWe downsize the engine and boost with the turbo \u2014 you get great torque response, great performance feel, better fuel economy, better emissions.\u201dMr. Felipe said Ford\u2019s EcoBoost program had filtered down to its F-150 trucks: 70 percent of current F-150 sales are for turbo-equipped engines. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been force-feeding this to our customers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who are telling us, with the high take rate, that they like turbos.\u201dA turbocharger adds about $200 to the cost of an engine, but that increase is often offset because a smaller engine is cheaper to build. \u201cIf we go from a V configuration to an in-line configuration, there\u2019s cost optimization,\u201d Mr. Damen said. Most four-cylinder engines use an in-line configuration.\u201cA V engine has a more elaborate block, two cylinder heads, two valve trains,\u201d Mr. Damen said. \u201cGo to an in-line, you only have one cylinder head, one valve train, and that\u2019s considerable.\u201dOne alternative to the turbocharger is still the supercharger, usually found in the powertrain architecture of high-performance cars.Mr. Damen isn\u2019t convinced it\u2019s a viable choice for mainstream vehicles. \u201cThe big advantage is that it takes energy directly from the crankshaft, so there is no lag in engine response,\u201d he said. \u201cThe downfall is that it uses primary energy \u2014 energy from the crankshaft \u2014 that you want to give to the wheels. Whereas a turbo uses waste energy that would otherwise be exhausted.\u201dMore development is underway to meet other challenges. BorgWarner, a key supplier for the industry, has shown an \u201ce-booster\u201d that it says will improve torque and vanquish the turbo-lag gremlin in current internal combustion engines by using electricity to spin the turbo up to 70,000 revolutions per minute in less than a second.At Garrett, the emphasis is also on refining an electrified, or e-turbo, booster, meant for hybrids that use the evolving 48-volt power system, which is replacing the 12-volt electrical networks in many cars.\u201cThe e-turbo gives you good low-end torque, lets you downsize the engine and regenerates some of the electricity it takes when you let off the throttle,\u201d said Mr. Balis, the Garrett official. The company demonstrated an e-turbo-equipped Audi Q7 this year.Mr. Bentley might be pleased to know that engines with big displacements and no forced induction \u2014 most of these are called naturally aspirated engines \u2014 live on in cars like Chevrolet\u2019s Corvette and Ford\u2019s Mustang GT.Innovations in lightweight engine materials and fuel-injection methods have led to improvements in these engines as well. And dedicated enthusiasts still regard them with affection: When Porsche announced that it would replace its naturally aspirated flat-six engine in its 718 models with a turbo four-cylinder, one wag wrote on a blog, \u201cPorsche Embraces Satan!\u201dDespite the assurance of Mr. Filipe of G.M. that \u201cin our lineup, there will always be a mix of turbo and naturally aspirated engines,\u201d Noah Charlap isn\u2019t convinced.\u201cIt\u2019s so sad when you pop open the hood of a four-cylinder Mustang and see a turbo,\u201d said Mr. Charlap, 37, who works as a mechanic at a Chevrolet store in Queens. Turbocharged cars are fine \u201cif you\u2019re the type of person who just likes to go from Point A to Point B. But if you enjoy driving, like I do, you\u2019re just not going to have that power on demand.\u201d With his voice trailing off, he added, \u201cSo, until internal combustion engines are banned entirely ...\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Ford, an Automaker at a Crossroads, Seeks Cuts and Partners", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDEARBORN, Mich. \u2014 When Ford Motor was celebrating the 100th anniversary of its Rouge industrial complex last week, its chairman, William C. Ford Jr., offered an optimistic outlook for the years ahead.The company is still solidly profitable, he said, and while it is losing money overseas, it is working on a solution. Furthermore, he praised the ability and leadership of Ford\u2019s chief executive, Jim Hackett, who he said was doing \u201ca really good job.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s even close to a crisis,\u201d he said.Not everyone shares his confidence.The automaker\u2019s bottom line is weakening despite record sales of its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. In August, its credit rating was cut to one level above junk status. And Ford\u2019s stock price has fallen to its lowest point since 2009, when the United States economy was in a deep recession.\u201cThe foundation of Ford \u2014 the trucks \u2014 is still healthy, but there are concerns about whether Ford has prepared for tomorrow and the future,\u201d said Karl Brauer, executive publisher of the auto information providers Autotrader and Kelley Blue Book. \u201cFord hasn\u2019t been effective enough in convincing investors that they are.\u201dIn the latest move to cut costs, Ford is reorganizing its worldwide salaried work force of 70,000 with the goal of having a leaner staff by the second quarter of 2019. The move, outlined to employees on Thursday, is likely to eliminate several thousand jobs, said Karen Hampton, a company spokeswoman.\u201cWe believe there will be reductions as part of it, but we don\u2019t have specific targets,\u201d Ms. Hampton said. She said the reorganization was meant to speed decision-making and cut the time it takes to develop new vehicles, two points that Mr. Hackett has emphasized.The effort was first reported by The Detroit Free Press.Part of the frustration among those sizing up the company stems from Mr. Hackett\u2019s slow rollout of a recovery plan. Since taking the helm in May 2017, Mr. Hackett has outlined broad cost-reduction goals, but has stopped short of explaining how they will be achieved. Ford once planned a daylong meeting with Wall Street analysts on Sept. 25, but canceled it in July, saying it needed more time.Elements of the plan are emerging bit by bit. Beyond the reduction in the salaried work force, another initiative involves partnerships.Ford is in talks with Volkswagen about a broad alliance that could help turn around its ailing operations in Europe and South America. It is also discussing ways to expand cooperation with Mahindra, the Indian automaker. India is another market where Ford is struggling.Mr. Ford, a great-grandson of the company\u2019s founder, Henry Ford, acknowledged the discussions at the Rouge complex, now the site of a plant that produces the F-150 pickup.\u201cWe don\u2019t ever rely on a partner to fix things for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to get our own house in order first. Partnerships can help with capital intensity and things like that.\u201dAnalysts said a partnership with Volkswagen could help both companies. Ford makes money on delivery vans and other small trucks, an area where Volkswagen struggles. The cooperation could involve helping Volkswagen produce small pickups like the Ford Ranger and sharing the cost of developing electric vehicles and other technologies to meet more stringent emissions regulations in Europe.\u201cVolkswagen is definitely intriguing,\u201d said Brian Johnson of Barclays Capital. \u201cYou can definitely see the business logic behind it.\u201dA century ago, Ford revolutionized auto manufacturing when it opened the Rouge complex. A marvel in its time, it produced cars and all their parts, including glass, tires and engines. It generated its own electricity, had a hospital and police station and employed as many as 100,000 workers. This vertical integration helped Ford lower costs enough to produce cars that ordinary people could afford.The urgency was highlighted last week when Mr. Hackett said on Bloomberg television that the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on imported aluminum and steel would raise Ford\u2019s costs by $1 billion. The company said the costs would be incurred in 2018 and 2019.The tariffs could erode the profit margins of the F-150, which has aluminum body panels. But Mr. Ford said the automaker had taken the tariffs into account and did not need to modify its turnaround plan.\u201cWe just want to work with the administration on trade issues, tariff issues, and they\u2019ve been quite good about it,\u201d he said. But Ford \u201cruns a lot better when we have certainty and we don\u2019t have big gyrations,\u201d he added. \u201cOur business is at its best when we have certainty with tax regimes, trade regimes.\u201dAnother trade move by the administration was welcomed by Ford \u2014 the agreement that keeps Canada in a three-nation trade zone in North America. Ford makes trucks and sport utility vehicles in Ontario.Just two years ago, Ford seemed like the healthiest of the three Detroit automakers. But while it makes a solid profit on trucks and S.U.V.s like the Explorer, recent earnings reports have shown it losing money on its cars. At the same time, profit has plunged in Europe and Asia, efforts to turn around its South American business have shown little progress, and returns in North America, by far Ford\u2019s largest region, have slumped.\u201cThe problem is they didn\u2019t update and redesign their products enough,\u201d said Michelle Krebs, executive analyst at Autotrader. \u201cIt comes back to being slow on product decisions and product development.\u201dBut his reluctance to spell out the elements of his restructuring plan has rankled analysts who follow the company and try to predict how much money it will make.Mr. Hackett was hailed for his previous tenure as chief executive \u2014 at the office-furniture company Steelcase \u2014 but he is facing a tougher challenge in running Ford, a much larger company with 200,000 employees and dozens of plants around the world.\u201cWe\u2019d like him to be crisper in going from high-level statements into the actionable plans they are going to carry out,\u201d Mr. Johnson of Barclays Capital said.The tension was evident in a July conference call when Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley expressed frustration at the lack of detail on what the $11 billion in charges will cover. He asked Mr. Hackett if he would still be around when it came time to assess the results.\u201cI think there should be zero question about that,\u201d Mr. Hackett replied.In the meantime, plenty of questions remain.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Peru Opposition Leader Keiko Fujimori Is Arrested in Corruption Inquiry", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLA PAZ, Bolivia \u2014 Keiko Fujimori, a powerful Peruvian politician whose father ruled the country in the 1990s, was arrested in a money laundering investigation on Wednesday, calling into question the future of the political family and their right-wing populist movement.Ms. Fujimori was detained at the chief prosecutor\u2019s office, where she had been called to testify in her own case, said her lawyer, Giuliana Loza, who called the arrest \u201carbitrary.\u201dProsecutors have been investigating whether Ms. Fujimori, the opposition leader, accepted illegal campaign contributions during her 2011 and 2016 presidential campaigns.About 100 of her supporters gathered at the courthouse to protest her arrest.Ms. Fujimori, who is considered a flight risk, will initially be held for at least 10 days while prosecutors consider filing formal charges.In a letter that she posted on Twitter on Wednesday, she denounced her arrest as unfair. \u201cPersecution is disguised as justice in our country,\u201d she wrote.The arrest orders for Ms. Fujimori and her father are a dramatic turn of events for one of Peru\u2019s most powerful families, which governed Peru in the 1990s with a brand of right-wing populism they were seeking to reestablish in the country.Ms. Fujimori\u2019s father was elected president in 1990 before he suspended the country\u2019s Constitution and ruled as a dictator. Though sent to jail on charges that he had been involved in the murder of at least 25 people during those years, Mr. Fujimori remained deeply popular among many Peruvians as his administration was also credited with improving the economy, investing in infrastructure and defeating left-wing groups that engaged in bloody conflict with the government.Ms. Fujimori has become one of Peru\u2019s most powerful politicians, commanding the Popular Force party, which controls the largest share of seats in the country\u2019s Congress. Many analysts feared that her rise \u2014 which included an attempt to impeach Peru\u2019s previous president, who eventually resigned \u2014 would do lasting damage to the country\u2019s democratic institutions.The recent detentions of Ms. Fujimori and her father have now led some to believe that the opposite may be true.\u201cI think it\u2019s a major point of weakening for Fujimorismo,\u201d said Eduardo Dargent, a political scientist at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, referring to the political movement that bears the family name.Ms. Fujimori has been the subject of a number of corruption investigations in recent years, including inquiries into her campaign financing, accusations of money laundering and questions regarding her ties to the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht, which has admitted paying hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes for construction projects in Latin America.Public anger turned against both Ms. Fujimori and investigators this July, when tapes in which judicial officials could be heard planning unofficial meetings with a \u201cSe\u00f1ora K\u201d were leaked to the press. Critics said that the nickname referred to Ms. Fujimori and that the officials were looking to cut an illicit deal with her. The ensuing scandal resulted in the firing and resignation of many top judiciary officials.Mr. Dargent, the political scientist, said prosecutors were now under increased pressure to show that they are clean of political influence \u2014 a possible motivation for Wednesday\u2019s arrest.There have been other signs of weakness within Ms. Fujimori\u2019s party, and within the family, in recent months. In local elections on Sunday, voters shut the party out of most mayoral offices.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Providence, Rhode Island, 9:18 P.M.", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "Documenting moments across the country, large and small, quiet and indelible.Supported byWhen this project was being conceived, a storm named Florence did not exist. It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L. Whitfield sermonized from the Gospel According to John. In one of the pews they built a dollhouse out of Bibles. Pastor Whitfield was baptized in the bayou that runs behind the church 54 years ago.

Stark, the little boy, stared out at all of this, a child of the desert in dank, humid air, and then he looked up at his father and said that when he grew up he was going to play professional soccer in Italy, and then he was going to come back to Florida and be a fishing guide.We set out to document 24 different hours in 24 states, to shine a lens on the lives of people rarely in the headlines.

Whitfield, 69, was baptized in the 15-mile bayou that runs behind True Vine Missionary Baptist Church in 1964, but it took him 35 years to get back to this place where he was first made in the spirit. In the intervening time, he came of age, worked as a contractor, had daughters and sons, built two churches with his own hands and led them, and saw his sons join the ministry and lead their own congregations in other Delta towns.His return to his spiritual birthplace was not a matter of if, but rather when \u2014 18 years ago this month.

{"Headline": "Chinese Intelligence Officers Accused of Stealing Aerospace Secrets", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Intelligence officers in a small office in China\u2019s vast intelligence-gathering network for years stole secrets from aerospace companies in the United States and abroad, Justice Department officials said on Tuesday in unsealing the third indictment in recent weeks that detailed China\u2019s elaborate efforts to steal corporate secrets through espionage and hacking.From January 2010 to May 2015, they stole turbofan engine plans and other confidential business information from 13 companies, according to court documents. They included Capstone Turbine, a gas turbine manufacturer based in Los Angeles, and other unnamed companies in Los Angeles and San Diego as well as Massachusetts, Arizona, Oregon and Wisconsin and overseas in Britain, France and Australia.At the time, a Chinese government-owned aerospace company was developing a comparable commercial aircraft engine, the government said.The officers worked in the Jiangsu Province office of the Ministry of State Security, China\u2019s primary domestic and foreign intelligence-gathering agency. That office was also at the heart of the two other recent cases involving China\u2019s efforts to steal information from the American aerospace industry.China has long pilfered American corporate, academic and military information to bolster its position in the global economy, and the three cases show the Justice Department\u2019s continued crackdown on China\u2019s efforts to steal corporate data for China\u2019s commercial gain, Adam L. Braverman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of California, said in a statement.\u201cThe concerted effort to steal, rather than simply purchase, commercially available products should offend every company that invests talent, energy and shareholder money into the development of products,\u201d he said.The information Mr. Ji provided would have been used in the Chinese government\u2019s efforts to recruit those employees as informants, the Justice Department said.The indictment unveiled on Tuesday accused the two intelligence officers, Zha Rong and Chai Meng, and other co-conspirators in the Jiangsu office of working with hackers to steal turbofan technology used in American and European commercial airliners. They also accused them of working with two employees in a Jiangsu Province office of the unnamed French aerospace manufacturer, Gu Gen and Tian Xi, who had been recruited to act as spies by the Chinese intelligence officers. They were also charged.An unidentified American company and the French manufacturer oversaw the turbofan engine project, according to court papers.The hackers \u2014 Zhang Zhang-Gui, Liu Chunliang, Gao Hong Kun, Zhuang Xiaowei and Ma Zhiqi \u2014 also infiltrated other companies that made turbofan jet engine parts, prosecutors said, and leased a global network of servers to hide their movements.The hackers sent spearphishing emails to company employees and planted malware into corporate computer networks, according to the indictment. They also turned their corporate websites into malicious sites that would compromise the computers of anyone who visited them, law enforcement officials said.From November 2013 to February 2014, they also groomed Mr. Tian and Mr. Gu, employees in the French aerospace company\u2019s China office, to work with Chinese intelligence officers, according to the indictment.Mr. Tian planted malicious software into his employer\u2019s computer systems for the Chinese intelligence officials, according to court documents.Mr. Gu, his office\u2019s head of information technology and security, told Chinese intelligence officers that law enforcement officials had noticed the presence of malware in the company\u2019s systems, prosecutors said. The warning allowed the conspirators to try to hide their identities.Mr. Zhang was also charged in a separate case claiming that he and another Chinese citizen used some of the stolen information for their own criminal scheme. The Justice Department intends to bring more such corporate theft cases, said John C. Demers, the head of the National Security Division at the agency.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Complaint: Bomb Plot Coverage Overtakes His Campaign Rhetoric", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 When President Trump took the podium in the East Room on Friday, he opened with a solemn expression of gratitude to the F.B.I. and other law enforcement agencies for arresting a suspect in a bomb plot against prominent Democrats and other critics of him.Moments later, Mr. Trump veered to more familiar terrain, railing against Democrats, globalists and the news media. He grinned in delight as his audience of young black conservatives chanted, \u201cLock \u2019em up,\u201d \u201cGeorge Soros\u201d and \u201cCNN sucks.\u201dAn energized Mr. Trump had planned to spend the final 10 days before the midterm elections whipping up Republican fears about a caravan of violent criminals allegedly heading toward the southern border and warning about the mob rule that will erupt if the Democrats capture the House of Representatives.But now, as it became clear that the bombing suspect, Cesar Sayoc Jr., 56, was a die-hard backer of the president, whose white van was a mobile shrine to him \u2014 plastered with stickers celebrating Mr. Trump and vilifying his foes \u2014 the president\u2019s appeals to nativism and partisan furies threatened to boomerang on him.For once, Mr. Trump conceded, he was not the master of the news cycle. The migrant caravan has been relegated to the background. New statistics showing a growing economy went largely unremarked upon. Mr. Trump seemed to take particular umbrage that his ambitious proposal to cut prescription drug prices got lost amid the breaking news about explosive devices turning up in post offices in Florida and New York City.\u201cThey were also competing with this story,\u201d he said with palpable frustration. \u201cNow our law enforcement\u2019s done such a good job,\u201d he added, \u201cmaybe that can start to disappear rapidly because we don\u2019t like those stories.\u201dBut on Friday, as Mr. Trump flew to Charlotte, N.C., for yet another rally, the bomb plot still dominated the airwaves. Photographs circulated of Mr. Sayoc holding a placard at a Trump rally and wearing a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball cap at his inauguration. Among the stickers on his van was one with Mrs. Clinton\u2019s face in a simulated gun-sight.\u201cI heard he was a person that preferred me over others,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters. But he denied any link between his inflammatory language and such acts of violence. \u201cThere\u2019s no blame,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no anything.\u201d\u201cI think I\u2019ve been toned down,\u201d the president said, adding, \u201cI could really tone it up.\u201dMr. Trump continued to scapegoat the news media in Charlotte, saying that the focus on Mr. Sayoc\u2019s political leanings was a product of their trying to start a political attack.\u201cWe have seen an effort by the media in recent hours to use the sinister actions of one individual to score political points against me and the Republican Party,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the rally. \u201cThe media has tried to attack the incredible Americans who support our movement to give power back to the people.\u201dFor a few minutes in the morning, Mr. Trump did manage to project a grave tone. \u201cThese terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country,\u201d he said, speaking from prepared remarks.\u201cWe will prosecute them, him, her \u2014 whoever it may be \u2014 to the fullest extent of the law,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe must never allow political violence to take root in America. We cannot let it happen.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s ambiguous language left open the possibility there could be more than one suspect in the case \u2014 a prospect that neither the F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, nor other law enforcement officials suggested in a later briefing.At least 14 explosive packages have been discovered since Monday.

Two packages each were addressed to Mr. Biden and Ms. Waters. | By Jugal K. Patel and Joe WardEarlier in the day, before he had been briefed about the case by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Mr. Trump\u2019s frustration boiled over. He characterized the bomb scares as an obstacle to Republican voters before the midterms.He even suggested that the threat was not real or was exaggerated by putting the word \u201cbomb\u201d in quotes \u2014 language that edged close to that of conspiracy theorists on the alt-right, who claimed without evidence that it was a false flag operation by Democrats to mobilize their voters.It was not clear how much he knew about the case before he posted this tweet, but he had received briefings throughout the week.Mr. Trump has never troubled himself with keeping a presidential mien during times of national crisis, whether it was wildfires in California, shootings in Chicago or the racial clashes in Charlottesville, Va. But even by his standards, his remarks in the White House before a crowd of a few hundred mostly African-American activists were discordant.In the same week that bombs were mailed to a former Democratic president, a vice president, a first lady, a senator and a congresswoman, Mr. Trump ridiculed the Democratic Party, saying its policies had led to unsafe communities, failing schools and overcrowded prisons. He even claimed erroneously that the party\u2019s name was \u201cDemocrat,\u201d adding, \u201cI hate it. I hate just saying it.\u201d\u201cLock \u2019em up,\u201d several people chanted.In the same week that a bomb was mailed to the suburban New York home of Mr. Soros, the philanthropist and Democratic donor \u2014 also the same week that Hungary\u2019s increasingly authoritarian government expelled a university founded by Mr. Soros \u2014 Mr. Trump inveighed against \u201cglobalists,\u201d whom he accused of cheating American workers.\u201cGeorge Soros!\u201d someone in the crowd shouted.\u201cThank you for being a nationalist,\u201d cried another.And in the same week that two explosives were mailed to CNN\u2019s New York offices \u2014 one addressed to John O. Brennan, the former C.I.A. director; the other to James R. Clapper, the former director of national intelligence \u2014 Mr. Trump said the news media attacked him relentlessly and never covered his successes.\u201cFake news!\u201d said a person.Gesturing and chuckling appreciatively, Mr. Trump repeated, \u201cFake news.\u201dAsked whether he planned to call Mr. Obama or any of the other Democrats who were targeted by the bombs, the president said, \u201cIf they wanted me to, but I think we\u2019ll probably pass.\u201dCritics denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s unrepentant partisanship on a day when explosive devices were still being uncovered. But close observers of his presidency were less surprised. The president was relying on a familiar instinct so close to the midterms, said Jon McHenry, a Republican pollster for North Star Opinion Research.\u201cThere\u2019s an argument to be made that midterms are base elections,\u201d Mr. McHenry said. \u201cTo the extent that this is true, the president has a consistent and proven method of speaking to his base and making sure they hear him above whatever other noise there is.\u201dIndeed, Mr. Trump has planned at least 10 rallies in eight states through Election Day, according to a senior White House official.Mr. Trump\u2019s willingness to reach out to his supporters in ways that offend others, Mr. McHenry said, has proved stronger than any recommendations that he tone down partisan attacks and refrain from lashing out at the news media.The political risk some pollsters see is the possibility of Mr. Trump alienating more moderate or independent voters who were leaning his way, with just days to go until the midterms.But Mr. McHenry said, \u201cWhether you agree with him or not, he gets to point up at the scoreboard and say he won.\u201dMark Landler reported from Washington, and Katie Rogers from Charlotte, N.C.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Planning to Vote in the November Election? Why Most Americans Probably Won\u2019t", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMADISON, W.Va. \u2014 Lula Hill voted in just about every election once she became old enough in 1952. Her coal mining family of registered Democrats believed that elections were like church services: You didn\u2019t skip them.But over time, her sense of civic obligation faded. Mines started laying people off. Opioids started poisoning her neighbors. As her town lost its vigor, Ms. Hill watched as smiling politicians kept making promises and, in her view, growing richer. By the late 1990s, when political leaders \u2014 Democrat or Republican \u2014 talked about the greater good, she no longer believed them.\u201cI just got to the point, I said, \u2018I\u2019m not going do it anymore,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Hill, sitting on a couch in the lobby of the hotel she owns and runs, the Hotel Madison, 30 miles south of Charleston. \u201cI just can\u2019t vote for any of them in good conscience.\u201dShe has not voted since 1996 and said she has no intention of starting in November. Ms. Hill is hardly alone in West Virginia, a state with one of the lowest rates of voter turnout in the country and where the Democratic senator, Joe Manchin III, faces a tough race.And while turnout has been higher in this season\u2019s special elections and primaries, experts say that in November it is still unlikely to break out of the middling range it has been stuck in for nearly a century.People typically cite one of two reasons for why they do not vote in midterm elections: they are either too busy or not interested, according to Dr. McDonald\u2019s analysis of responses to the Census Bureau from 2000 to 2016.Americans used to vote at much higher rates \u2014 sometimes above 80 percent in the second half of the 19th century. In those years, a multitude of parties brought a vibrancy to political life. Party machines helped people with jobs, fuel bills and funeral expenses in return for votes.The effect, he said, has been a more unequal society and \u201cmore of a gap between what we say this country is about and what it really is.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Until about the 1980s, West Virginia had some of the highest voting rates in the country. In 1952, the first year Ms. Hill voted, 77 percent of West Virginians turned out, according to Dr. McDonald, a stunning number by today\u2019s standards and higher than the national rate then of 62 percent. Voting back then was festive, a social occasion at the polls. People put on their nice clothes. Women brought cornbread and pinto beans.\u201cYou\u2019d go in there and there\u2019d be people everywhere,\u201d said Albert Baisden, a retired trucking company owner in Dingess, recalling election times in the 1950s. \u201cYou had to fight your way in through the crowd to get to vote. You couldn\u2019t hardly get a parking place. Everybody was grabbing you by the right arm, by the left arm, saying, \u2018Vote for me!\u2019\u201dBack then, this patch of West Virginia was more vibrant, as well. Ms. Hill recalled that her hotel was full almost every night, mostly with men working in construction for the mines. She remembers they used to take off their work boots in their trucks and change into slippers so they would not track mud on her carpet.But in the span of a generation, the town\u2019s sense of community fell apart, she said. Ms. Hill said she has had 27 flat-screen TVs stolen from her rooms. Eventually she stopped replacing them. Even the cushions on the couch in her lobby were stolen; a lawn chair pad is in their place.\u201cWe have nothing now,\u201d Ms. Hill said, sitting in the lobby of the hotel, an airy room with tall ceilings and wall paneling adorned with teapots and cuckoo clocks. \u201cIt\u2019s all gone.\u201dVoting went down, too. The midterm election of 1998 was the first time in Ms. Hill\u2019s life she did not vote. She was not alone: Only 29 percent of eligible West Virginians voted that year, according to Dr. McDonald\u2019s data.The strongest predictor of voting, according to Dr. Highton, is political engagement. Those who are interested in politics \u2014 whether they grew up in families that followed it or developed interest as an adult \u2014 tend to vote, he said.\u201cIt\u2019s like being a sports fan,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people just aren\u2019t.\u201dClara Bender, 69, a waitress in Madison, has never voted.\u201cI just never got into it,\u201d she said, as she cleared a table for a customer. \u201cI got married, had babies \u2014 just never had the time.\u201dMs. Bender said she did not know enough about the candidates to choose.But she is public spirited in other ways. As a young mother, she got involved in her children\u2019s school. She raised her granddaughter and helped her open the restaurant where their family now works. These days, she spends most of her time being a patient listener for a community whose heart is broken. The woman she was just serving, she said, had a son addicted to drugs and was crying when she walked in. \u201cI have to make time for them,\u201d she said.As for never voting: \u201cIt just didn\u2019t bother me.\u201dTo Carrena Rouse, an English teacher at Scott High School, that is a bitter pill, especially after watching the extraordinary energy over the statewide teachers\u2019 strike earlier this year.\u201cPeople say my vote won\u2019t do any good, but I beg to differ,\u201d said Ms. Rouse, who was among the thousands of teachers who went on strike.She believes the state is dominated by coal money and politicians who pander to it precisely because people let it be by not voting. And she thought the teachers\u2019 strike and the outpouring of public support they got would translate into more votes in the state\u2019s primary in May.But she was disappointed that only 26 percent of registered voters went to the polls, \u201cafter everything that happened,\u201d she said.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.\u201cThat\u2019s the disturbing part,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to use language like \u2018betrayed,\u2019 but pretty close.\u201dStill, the voting rate on Primary Day was up by nearly a third from the primary in 2014, according to West Virginia\u2019s Office of the Secretary of State.Many younger people interviewed in Madison last month said that they would vote, but that they did not spend much time thinking about politics or consider it a part of their identity. Jennifer Anderson, a worker at Miller Brothers Pharmacy, said she did not know the political orientation of her colleagues. She said she would probably vote, but she has not yet decided for whom or for which party.\u201cSome of my issues are on one side, and some are on the other,\u201d she said.Turnout in West Virginia was higher in May despite a new voter ID law the state put in effect in January. Generally, new laws around voting access can make it easier or harder to vote, but researchers say they do not explain much about the country\u2019s lackluster turnout. About 2 percent of people told the Census Bureau they did not vote in the last midterm election because of problems with registration, according to Dr. McDonald.For Ms. Hill, national politics feels distant these days, as if events are happening on another planet.\u201cI\u2019m just to the point where I\u2019m so disillusioned over what goes on,\u201d she said of politicians in Washington and her state. \u201cAll they are doing is slinging mud at each other. If they would just stop the squabbling and think of the people.\u201dBesides, she had more important things to think about. She was busy washing sheets and cleaning rooms. A pipe was leaking and she needed a plumber.\u201cMy sister said, \u2018Sis, we didn\u2019t vote so we don\u2019t have the right to complain,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat may be true, but I might have felt even worse voting for some of these people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Connecticut, What\u2019s Worst: Trump, Gov. Malloy or the Economy?", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHARTFORD \u2014 In races for governor across the nation, the specter of President Trump looms as a beacon of divisiveness, and Connecticut is no exception.Ned Lamont, the Democratic candidate for governor, has tried to tie the Republican candidate, Bob Stefanowski, to Mr. Trump during debates, commercials and campaign mailers, including one that suggested that Mr. Stefanowski was guest starring in an episode of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d entitled, \u201cHow to run Connecticut into the ground.\u201dIn a state that has voted Democrat in the last seven presidential elections, including 2016, when Hillary Clinton drew 54.6 percent of the vote to Mr. Trump\u2019s 40.9 percent, Mr. Lamont\u2019s strategy would seem sound.Mr. Stefanowski has tried to link Mr. Malloy to Mr. Lamont, suggesting in a campaign mailer that one was a mirror image of the other, and that Mr. Lamont would raise taxes to an unconscionable level.\u201cThere is not a whole lot of connection between how we vote or feel at the presidential level and how we vote at the gubernatorial level,\u201d said Ronald Schurin, an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut. \u201cThis is the national Republicans\u2019 greatest hope of picking up a gubernatorial seat in 2018.\u201dConnecticut is a decidedly blue state: Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by a ratio of 5 to 3, and Democratic candidates are favored in the state\u2019s five congressional House races and the lone Senate race, where Senator Chris Murphy is expected to easily rebuff his Republican opponent, Matthew Corey, a Navy veteran who owns a window-washing business and bar.But voters here have a penchant for alternating between the two major parties when it comes to sending a governor to the state capital.Beyond the competition between anti-Trump activism and Mr. Malloy\u2019s rock-bottom approval ratings, the other predominant campaign issue is the state\u2019s poor fiscal health; it is projected to have a budget deficit hovering north of $4 billion over the next two years.Which candidate\u2019s vision resonates with voters remains to be seen.Nonetheless, Mr. Stefanowski, 56, would seem an unusual standard-bearer for the Republican Party.During both the primary and general-election campaigns, he has faced criticism for not voting during a 16-year period. (A campaign spokesman said Mr. Stefanowski, a former executive at General Electric, UBS Investment Bank and other firms, lived and worked in London for 10 of those years.) There were also questions when, after a quarter century as a Republican, Mr. Stefanowski changed his party affiliation to Democrat for several months before switching back last year.Similarly, Mr. Lamont, a wealthy telecommunications entrepreneur of Greenwich, has not always toed the Democratic Party line.To the consternation of some party leaders, he oversaw a striking upset of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman in the 2006 Democratic primary, before losing in the general election to Mr. Lieberman, who ran as an independent. He then ran for governor in 2010, but lost to Mr. Malloy in the primary. Previously, he served on the Greenwich board of selectmen for one term in the 1980s.By the Democratic primary in August, Mr. Lamont, 64, had long made amends; with his party\u2019s backing, he trounced his sole opponent, Joseph P. Ganim, the mayor of Bridgeport who had served several years in federal prison after his conviction on corruption charges.On Friday, the former vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party, came to Connecticut to stump for Mr. Lamont, as well as for a couple of other candidates.Mr. Griebel rejects the notion that he is only running as a spoiler, pointing out that, of the 2.1 million registered voters in the state, nearly 900,000 are unaffiliated. He blames the two-party system for a lack of job growth over three decades, as well as higher taxes and a dearth of investment in transportation and education.\u201cThe true \u2018spoiler\u2019 is the duopoly that cares first and foremost for its perpetuation,\u201d he said.Both Mr. Lamont and Mr. Stefanowski have eschewed the state\u2019s famously generous public financing system, which gives qualified candidates $6 million toward general-election campaigns. Mr. Lamont has contributed several million dollars to his campaign, while Mr. Stefanowski funded his primary challenge with $2.3 million of his own.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.All three candidates have refined their messages about the economy. While other states rebounded after the 2008 financial crisis, Connecticut lagged. The jobs that were eventually added back paid substantially less than the ones that were lost. Mr. Griebel wants to eliminate the \u201cbusiness entity\u201d tax, a cut that would cost $60 million in revenue but, he said, would signal a \u201cmore friendly environment for employers.\u201dHis two opponents proffer other solutions. Mr. Stefanowski would take an ax to the state\u2019s spending with an approach known as zero-base budgeting, with no sacred cows. To jump-start the economy, he would also slash taxes \u2014 eliminating estate and gift taxes immediately and phasing out both personal and corporate income taxes.After an event at a public school here, Mr. Lamont called Mr. Stefanowski\u2019s tax proposals reckless. While he plans to provide residents with some property tax relief in the form of rebate checks, he would not touch the personal income tax, which yields about $10 billion a year in state revenue.\u201cRight now, I would leave the income tax where it is,\u201d said Mr. Lamont after he appeared with Senator Murphy, visiting music and history classes at Hartford Magnet Trinity College Academy. \u201cIt\u2019s the workhorse of the budget.\u201dInstead, he would focus on economic development and job training. Mr. Lamont wants to invest in community colleges so that students learn specialized skills that businesses need. And, he said, he would finance transportation improvements throughout the state to attract new employers.Four other congressional seats, all occupied by Democrats, are also up for election. But the incumbents are facing unknown candidates, most with little or no money.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marijuana Legalization in Canada Has Companies Chasing a Green Rush", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySMITHS FALLS, Ontario \u2014 Millions of dollars worth of marijuana plants sat under lamps brighter than the noonday sun as employees of Canada\u2019s largest cannabis business bustled about the 47 giant growing rooms of its factory, which once made Hershey bars.Now it\u2019s home to Tweed, whose parent company, Canopy Growth, was the first Canadian marijuana grower to debut on the New York Stock Exchange.Valued at more than $10 billion, Canopy is worth even more than Bombardier, the Canadian manufacturer that is one of the world\u2019s largest makers of planes and trains, offering a stark example of this nation\u2019s new get-rich-quick hope \u2014 the marijuana industry.On Oct. 17, Canada is set to become only the second country in the world and the first major economy to legalize marijuana for all uses. Companies are clamoring to join in what some are calling a green rush.\u201cIt\u2019s like Seagram\u2019s back when Prohibition was in place and just about to end,\u201d said Deborah Weinstein, a lawyer in Ottawa who handled Canopy\u2019s move onto the Toronto Stock Exchange, with the stock symbol WEED. \u201cBut it\u2019s more than that. This has never been an industry.\u201dOn the same day that marijuana becomes legal, the government will announce a program to make it easier for Canadians convicted of possessing small amounts of marijuana to obtain a pardon, according to an official familiar with the plan.The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that because several details must still be worked out, the program will not become active immediately. Pardons are to be available only for people convicted of possessing 30 grams of marijuana or less, the legal limit under the new system.The law limits the products that can contain cannabis; edibles, for example, will not be legal until next year.The legislation also heavily restricts advertising and is laden with bureaucratic rules, including licensing and inspection requirements for producers.The fervor is a little reminiscent of the dot-com boom of the 1990s. The top 12 Canadian marijuana companies are now worth nearly 55 billion Canadian dollars, or $42 billion, and investors are snapping up the stock.Profits, though, are a dream of the future. At Tweed, for example, sales last year from the medical marijuana business were just 77 million Canadian dollars. The company lost 70 million dollars.Some investors may be sorry. Not every marijuana producer now taking stock markets by storm will profit and survive, many experts believe.There are 120 businesses licensed to grow medical marijuana, which has been legal in Canada since 2001. They are now poised to serve people who simply want to get high. In provinces where the private sector will handle retail sales, companies are scrambling for licenses to open stores.Shoppers Drug Mart, the country\u2019s largest pharmacy chain, has taken out a medical cannabis producer license.Most big alcohol players appear to be sitting back for now, except for some investments, but analysts expect they will eventually get more involved.A notable exception is Jakob Ripshtein, who used to head the Canadian operations of Diageo, the British-based liquor giant that makes Guinness beer and owns several of Seagram\u2019s brands.In May, he became the chief operating officer of Aphria, which owns an expansive and expanding marijuana greenhouse complex near Leamington, Ontario.\u201cDo I believe there are going to be different players coming into the industry?\u201d Mr. Ripshtein said. \u201cI absolutely do.\u201dOnly dried cannabis, oils and seeds will go on sale this month. But the industry is dreaming up a future that will include products like cannabis-laced candies. At a large lab at Tweed, for example, scientists are laboring away under fume hoods on marijuana drinks.There is also an industry around the industry, already making money.Businesses have sprung up to create the software that allows growers to track their plants and final products, as the government requires. Marijuana growers are also voracious consumers of supplies like fertilizers, as well as energy.And greenhouse makers now have a customer base beyond tomato and green pepper farmers.Beyond that, abandoned factories, like the one Tweed operates in, have suddenly become hot properties.Even Canadian news organizations have joined in. In Toronto, The Globe and Mail has hired reporters and editors to produce \u201cCannabis Professional,\u201d a daily newsletter that will cost 2,000 Canadian dollars a year for a subscription.David Campbell is one of those profiting from the boom.Mr. Campbell, 50, has a background in management at companies that make machines dauntingly known as \u201csupercritical fluid botanical carbon dioxide extraction systems.\u201d Typically they decaffeinate coffee.But they are also ideal for squeezing the active ingredients out of marijuana plants to create oil.So in 2015, when Justin Trudeau was campaigning for recreational legalization (Uruguay legalized the drug in 2013), Mr. Campbell set up Advanced Extraction Systems in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, just to serve the cannabis industry.Mr. Campbell hasn\u2019t looked back. The company has sold 12 systems this year, including one to a medical marijuana company in Germany. Advanced has gone from one employee, Mr. Campbell, to 14, most of them engineers.\u201cWe feel this is just the beginning,\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \u201cWe\u2019re targeting California hard now.\u201dEven seemingly minor announcements about the industry can create paper fortunes overnight.The value of the sale is so small that the company declined to disclose it. But the news still sent Tilray\u2019s stock price up by 78 percent, adding billions to its value. The excitement soon faded and its shares have dropped back toward their previous value.Meanwhile, the size of the industry is anyone\u2019s guess.No one knows what will happen now to the illegal trade, with its greater selection and lower prices, although the government has vowed to stamp it out.The biggest players in Canadian marijuana, including Canopy, came out of the medical marijuana system, which was greatly expanded about five years ago.Bruce Linton, Canopy\u2019s chief executive, acknowledged that from the first days of legal medical marijuana his mind was on the day that the much larger recreational market would open for legitimate business.But he, like most in the cannabis business, sees the government\u2019s tight limits on advertising and marketing as an obstacle to future profits.The government requires that marijuana be sold in plain packages that feature large health warnings and tiny logos. Advertising is limited to what Health Canada, the federal department that regulates cannabis, calls \u201cinformation-type promotion\u201d and \u201cbrand-preference promotion\u201d all of which must be kept away from the eyes of children.No ads are supposed to appear until Oct. 17, but several companies have jumped the gun and run advertisements that bend \u2014 or possibly break \u2014 the upcoming rules.Health Canada said in a statement that it has cautioned several of the companies.At the same time, a steady stream of lobbyists to Ottawa has been pushing for looser marketing rules, among other things.Federal lobbying records show that public servants, political staff members and cabinet ministers have received 583 visits or phone calls from marijuana industry lobbyists since Mr. Trudeau was sworn in as prime minister in November 2015. That includes 92 lobbying visits alone by Brendan Kennedy, the president and chief executive of Tilray.In the Tweed factory in eastern Ontario, where children used to buy broken candy bars from Hershey, Tweed has a carefully appointed visitors\u2019 center, museum, cafe and gift shop offering clothing and marijuana paraphernalia.Visitors can learn that Louis H\u00e9bert sowed the first cannabis seeds in what would become Canada in 1606, and sniff the scents of the company\u2019s various strains of marijuana.The atmosphere is a more successful tech start-up than Cheech and Chong, with employees in white lab coats, disposable jumpsuits or black T-shirts, all bearing the company\u2019s retro script logo.One recent day in the visitors\u2019 center, two of Tweed\u2019s 2,000 global employees talked over social media strategies at a long table of artfully distressed wood.Mr. Linton was there, too, preparing to meet the civic leadership of Smiths Falls to discuss a mural for an outer factory wall that would depict the history of the town and imagine its future.He recalled when cannabis was hardly a sure bet.For much of his career Mr. Linton was involved in several tech start-ups in Ottawa.When he decided just over five years ago to leave tech behind to start a marijuana business, his associates and family members had a unanimous view that it was a \u201cvery, very bad idea.\u201d They were almost proved right.In its early days, the company twice ran out of money, Mr. Linton said, and narrowly avoided bankruptcy only because of a last-minute infusion of cash from hard-to-find investors.Now investors have bet billions of dollars on his vision. And Mr. Linton declared that Oct. 17 will be a unique moment in Canada\u2019s history.Catherine Porter and Lindsey Wiebe contributed reporting from Toronto.

{"Headline": "U.S. Economy Charged Ahead in the Third Quarter", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe American economy barreled ahead in the third quarter as consumers stepped up and spent more, keeping it on track for the best annual performance since 2005.The government said on Friday that the economy expanded at an annualized rate of 3.5 percent between July and September after the 4.2 percent pace in the previous quarter. But there were signs that the growth could cool in the coming months.Businesses remain hesitant to increase spending, despite the large corporate tax cut enacted late last year. Some of the gains were also one-offs that could fade quickly, like the restocking of shelves at stores and warehouses, which contributed more than half of the overall growth.If there is a slowdown in the economy, it could further unsettle the markets, which have slumped in recent weeks. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 1.7 percent on Friday and is down nearly 9 percent for the month.\u201cClearly a strong headline, but the details are a little less robust,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, who leads United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Still, with 10 days to go before the midterm election, the headline number will be a valuable talking point for Republicans on the campaign trail. The second and third quarters represented the strongest back-to-back growth since 2014, and Republican leaders were quick to claim credit.\u201cAmericans have more opportunity and more money in their pockets today than they did two years ago, and that\u2019s in large part due to the reforms we\u2019ve pushed forward,\u201d said Representative Erik Paulsen, a Minnesota Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee and is in a tight race for re-election, according to recent polls.Tax cuts for individuals and the budget deal early this year, which raised federal spending, helped elevate growth in the third quarter. Consumer spending increased 4 percent, and federal outlays rose 3.3 percent.\u201cThere will come a day of reckoning for the economy after the money from the tax cuts is all gone,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank, \u201cbut for today Washington really has something to crow about.\u201dThe effect of the corporate tax cut was less evident. Businesses did not ramp up investment in equipment and factories \u2014 the kinds of things executives do when they anticipate the good times to continue.\u201cYou really lean back in your chair and wonder whether this enormous tax cut that was given to corporations only lasted three months,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank. \u201cThe economics textbook would say that if you give a tax cut that lasts several years, you should see the effects for several years.\u201dLooking ahead, Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said that he was not expecting a big rebound in business spending and that \u201cif you\u2019re banking on strong G.D.P. growth, you need business investment.\u201dAnother wild card is the effect from one of President Trump\u2019s signature economic moves: increasing tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese imports. The president has also raised tariffs on imports from around the world, including on steel, aluminum and solar panels. So far, there is little evidence that those trade policies have hurt growth much.A surge in soybean purchases by buyers seeking to act before retaliatory Chinese tariffs kicked in helped lift gross domestic product in the second quarter. But that uptick reversed itself in the third quarter.\u201cOne interpretation of the data is that the trade war is not having the intended effect of boosting exports and lowering imports,\u201d Mr. Slok said. \u201cAnother interpretation is that the trade war can\u2019t do much about that. If the consumer spends more, you will have more imports.\u201dTrip Tollison, chief executive of the Savannah Economic Development Authority in Georgia, said that shipping volume at the Port of Savannah was up 12 percent from a year ago and that there were almost no vacancies in the industrial real estate market. Warehouses and logistics companies have been among the most active businesses in the area.\u201cWe\u2019re in a great spot, no complaints for sure,\u201d Mr. Tollison said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a very strong economy right now.\u201dThe latest data could increase the likelihood that policymakers at the Federal Reserve will continue to gradually raise interest rates, in order to prevent the economy from overheating and to head off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise rates one more time this year, in December, and several times in 2019.Officials at the Fed, who do not report to the president, consider themselves above politics. Mr. Trump\u2019s attack is highly unusual.The steady increase in borrowing costs is already being felt in the housing market. Residential investment slid 4 percent in the third quarter, and has fallen in five of the last six quarters.Rising interest rates also put downward pressure on stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has been climbing, which makes riskier stocks less appealing to investors than safer bonds.\u201cWe can only think investors are already looking ahead to economic conditions next year when the fiscal stimulus boost starts to fade,\u201d Mr. Rupkey of MUFG Union Bank said. \u201cFor the stock market, the economy\u2019s as good as it gets, and after buying the rumors, they are selling the fact.\u201dWall Street\u2019s recent decline, which began in early October, came too late to affect sentiment or spending in the third quarter. But on Main Street, consumers do have plenty to cheer. Unemployment in September stood at 3.7 percent, the lowest in nearly half a century, and wages are finally rising.In Chicago, Avant, an online consumer lender with 600 employees, is planning to hire 400 more people by the end of 2019. The company specializes in lending to families earning between $40,000 and $100,000 for things like debt consolidation, auto repairs and medical bills. It also sells online lending technology to banks.\u201cConsumers today are in great shape,\u201d said Al Goldstein, Avant\u2019s chief executive.

{"Headline": "What Canada Can Learn from California on Marijuana Legalization", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "A New York Times correspondent who has covered the legalization of marijuana in California offers some suggestions on what Canadians may expect.Supported byDear Canada:You\u2019re in for a wild ride.There\u2019s cannabis roll-on pain reliever, sparkling water infused with marijuana, cannabis for pets. I get invited to cannabis lounges and a marijuana history tour of San Francisco. Cannabis is infused \u2014 that seems to be industry\u2019s word of choice \u2014 into a huge variety of foods and candies. Chefs are concocting gourmet dinners that pair marijuana with another drug, the liquid one that California is famous for.How about some marijuana-leaf pesto with a glass of Napa chardonnay?Yet despite all of the innovation and energy in the legalized market, the black market is still dominant. Only around 3 percent of marijuana farmers in the state have obtained licenses, said Hezekiah Allen, the executive director of the California Growers Association, a marijuana advocacy group.It\u2019s hard to persuade pot farmers who have been producing in the shadows for decades to fill out voluminous paperwork, pay taxes and comply with reams of environmental regulations, Mr. Allen said. And he believes there are parallels between Canada and California, especially in British Columbia, where growers have operated in the wilds for decades just as they have in Humboldt County in California.Legalization in California, pardon the expression, is only half-baked.It\u2019s become clear to regulators and the cannabis business over all that legalization is not something that happens in a single day, or year.Yes, the marijuana business has exploded into its own economy in California. There are conferences, magazines, cannabis testing companies, marijuana market research organizations, law firms specializing in cannabis law, apps to compare cannabis brands and find weed shops.All of this is pumped out to the wider world by cannabis public relations companies.But legal sales of marijuana are far below what proponents of legalization had hoped for.Licensed sales of marijuana are likely to reach $3.4 billion this year, according to Tom Adams of BDS Analytics, a company that tracks retail cannabis sales. But that\u2019s not much more than the $3 billion of sales last year, when only medical marijuana was available.The problem is that regulated marijuana, which is subject to testing, taxes and many other regulations \u2014 as it will be in Canada \u2014 costs significantly more than pot grown and sold on the black market.Mr. Adams calculated that if a black market gram of marijuana flower sells for $6.25, it would cost $11.08 per gram \u2014 77 percent more \u2014 in the licensed market.\u201cAs long as there is onerous regulation and taxation imposed on the legal market, you can forget about getting rid of the illicit market,\u201d Mr. Adams said.Even consumers who don\u2019t mind paying extra for legal marijuana often have to go out of their way to get it, because many City Councils and county boards of supervisors have decided against licensing marijuana businesses.Only 19 percent of California cities have a marijuana retail shop, according to Weedmaps, a company that tracks cannabis businesses in the state.The fact is: Liberal Californians voted convincingly to legalize cannabis in 2016, but they didn\u2019t necessarily want a marijuana shop down the block.This reality is far from the vision that many Californians had of legalization when the ballot measure passed in 2016. One of the leading arguments in favor of legalization was the suggestion that it would wipe out the black market for pot.A state where politicians have long cited the futility of the war on drugs now must decide what to do about scofflaws in a legalized system. California, by far the country\u2019s largest producer of cannabis, still supplies the rest of America with millions of pounds of black-market marijuana.The state must also reckon with lower tax revenues than anticipated.The ballot measure legalizing marijuana promised annual tax windfalls of a billion dollars. Yet in the first two quarters of this year, the state reported just $135 million in cannabis tax revenues, not including municipal taxes.It\u2019s of course still early days. Many industry players predict that the black-market marijuana will continue in the same way the moonshine business lingered in dry parts of the South after Prohibition ended.But Daniel Okrent, the author of \u201cLast Call,\u201d a history of Prohibition, said most of the black market for alcohol disappeared quickly after Prohibition. \u201cNearly immediately in most of the country the illegals became legal,\u201d he said.For now, the California marijuana business feels like Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. It\u2019s a mad rush to establish brands and capture market share.Hollywood stars, musicians and politicians are joining the green rush. Here\u2019s one example: After losing a primary bid in the race for California governor, Antonio Villaraigosa, the former Los Angeles mayor, joined the board of a large cannabis company.On a cultural level, the legal pot industry is reaching for some respectability through language. Public relations people urge reporters to refrain from using the words marijuana or pot. They prefer cannabis.Pot that is grown outdoors is \u201csun grown.\u201d A joint sold in a retail store is a \u201cpre-roll.\u201d Niche brands market their buds as \u201cheirloom flowers.\u201dLegalization is still a work in progress in California, but there\u2019s no denying the capitalist zeal of the nascent, legalized industry. Decades ago, pot was something you needed to keep hidden from the authorities in the state. In today\u2019s California it\u2019s advertised on billboards and on the sides of buses.And the emails keep coming. A marijuana-themed cookbook, peppermint-flavored cannabis mouth spray to treat aches and pains, a global equity fund investing in the hemp industry, a cannabis superstore in Las Vegas.And pot-infused \u201cmarshmellows.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Fed\u2019s Powell Says Strong Economic Path \u2018Not Too Good to Be True\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBOSTON \u2014 Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said Tuesday that the American economy is enjoying an unusual but sustainable period of low unemployment and low inflation. He described the current moment, and the Fed\u2019s expectation that it will continue, as \u201cnot too good to be true.\u201dInflation is hovering around the 2 percent annual pace that the central bank regards as optimal while the unemployment rate has remained close to 4 percent for the last year. Economists have long regarded low unemployment as a harbinger of higher inflation, and there is no precedent in modern American history for both economic indicators to remain at such low levels.But Mr. Powell said there was reason to believe this time could be different.He said the Fed\u2019s success in holding down inflation in recent decades has reinforced public expectations that inflation would stay low, and that, in turn, is helping to keep inflation low.The Fed chairman\u2019s remarks are likely to resonate with Trump administration officials, who insist that faster economic growth is sustainable. \u201cI\u2019m in favor of higher wages,\u201d Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s chief economic adviser, told reporters on Tuesday after Amazon\u2019s announcement. \u201cMore people working and prospering \u2014 you\u2019ve heard me say this before \u2014 is not inflationary. It\u2019s a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201dFed officials have long assumed inflation and unemployment sit on opposite ends of a seesaw: As unemployment falls, inflation tends to rise; as unemployment rises, inflation tends to fall.That model, known as the Phillips curve, accurately described the relationship between inflation and unemployment in the middle of the 20th century. But the volatility of inflation has diminished in recent decades. As unemployment has swelled and subsided, inflation has remained low and steady.Mr. Powell said Tuesday that the relationship has been weakened by the Fed\u2019s success in controlling inflation, which has instilled confidence that the Fed will continue to control inflation. As a result, even when unemployment falls, investors are not as quick to build higher inflation expectations into asset prices.\u201cMany factors, including better conduct of monetary policy over the past few decades, have greatly reduced but not eliminated the effects that tight labor markets have on inflation,\u201d Mr. Powell said.While the Fed sees little slack in the economy, Mr. Powell said he did not see wage growth as an indication that the economy was beginning to overheat since wages were rising in line with inflation and productivity. Even if wage growth began to outpace inflation and productivity, Mr. Powell said it still might not foretell faster inflation, pointing to the example of the 1990s.\u201cThe key is anchored expectations\u201d for stable inflation, Mr. Powell said.He added, however, that the Fed would remain watchful. \u201cCommon sense suggests we should beware when forecasts predict events seldom before observed in the economy,\u201d he said.Mr. Powell said that the Fed was raising rates because it might be wrong about the dangers of inflation, but that it was moving slowly because it did not want to impede or end economic growth.\u201cOur ongoing policy of gradual interest rate normalization reflects our efforts to balance the inevitable risks that come with extraordinary times, so as to extend the current expansion, while maintaining maximum employment and low and stable inflation,\u201d Mr. Powell said.Mr. Powell said the Fed also was paying attention to the economic performance of the rest of the world. The recovery in other developed nations has lagged behind that of the United States, but Mr. Powell said the overall picture remained \u201creasonably positive.\u201d\u201cI think growth is still healthy, but maybe under a little pressure,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Elena, 22, took off her robe and stood up. Evaggelia, her 59-year-old, fiery-tempered madam, immediately went into her pitch.\u201cMy girl is flawless,\u201d Evaggelia said in Greek. \u201cI recommend her without reservation.\u201d She recited the \u201cmenu,\u201d and added that with one exception, \u201cmy girl does everything in bed.\u201dWithout taking off his sunglasses, the paunchy middle-aged client rubbed his chin and eyed Elena, a Russian-Polish prostitute, as she flipped her blond hair and turned in sky-high black heels. \u201cO.K.,\u201d he finally said.The price? Twenty euros, about $23.I was sitting a foot away on a small couch fitted with a plastic slipcover inside a brothel, witnessing this age-old transaction. We were on Filis Street \u2014 a warren of alleyways and dingy two-story houses \u2014 which has been home to Athenian brothels for most of the past century.The trade is more desperate now because of Greece\u2019s lost decade since the 2008 financial crisis, which has left no profession unscathed. The collapsed economy and the arrival of tens of thousands of migrants have pushed even more women into prostitution \u2014 even as prices have fallen through the floor.And for all the talk of a new era in gender relations, with women around the world speaking out and forcing a reckoning against sexual violence, #MeToo does not exist here in this room bathed in red and purple lights, where the women are silent and their bodies are for sale, and a coffee table is loaded with condoms.\u201cI had a flower shop for 18 years \u2014 and now I\u2019m here out of necessity, not out of joy,\u201d said Dimitra, a middle-aged woman who lost her shop in the crisis and now works as a madam on Filis Street. \u201cI used to be called Mrs. Dimitra, but now I\u2019ve become a whore.\u201dIn Greece, prostitution is legal in registered brothels, though the vast majority of brothels in Athens are unregistered. Street prostitution is illegal, yet women routinely sell sex on some street corners. While many women enter the profession out of economic necessity, others are trafficked or coerced into sex work.\u201cProstitution has increased and changed, basically in the context of the new political, economic and cultural environment,\u201d said Grigoris Lazos, a professor of criminology at Panteion University in Athens, referring to Greece\u2019s painful economic austerity.Mr. Lazos spent six years researching how the country\u2019s twin crises \u2014 migration and economic austerity \u2014 had changed prostitution in Athens. He found that the number of prostitutes in the city had increased by 7 percent since 2012, yet prices have dropped drastically, both for women working on the streets and in brothels.\u201cIn 2012, it would require an average of 39 euros\u201d for a client to hire a prostitute in a brothel, Mr. Lazos said, \u201cwhile in 2017 just \u20ac17 \u2014 a 56 percent decrease.\u201dAccording to Greek law, a brothel has to be at least about 655 feet away from schools, hospitals, churches, nurseries and public squares, among other places. But given the density of downtown Athens, it\u2019s virtually impossible to house prostitutes there legally. Mr. Lazos found that only eight of the 798 brothels operating in the city in August were legal.The number was vastly different from the police statistics, which count no more than 300 brothels in the city. A spokesman for the Athenian police, Theodoros Chronopoulos, explained that the official number does not include hidden brothels.Mr. Chronopoulos said that officers aggressively work to break up trafficking rings, pointing to rising arrests. But the police mostly leave brothels alone, he said, partly because of the sense among the authorities that they help single men deal with loneliness.\u201cWe\u2019re quite tolerant when it comes to brothels,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we understand that what they do is social service.\u201dThe police later provided an additional statement, with Mr. Chronopoulos saying: \u201cThere is no tolerance when it comes to brothels. The checks are intensive and constant and violations are applied where appropriate.\u201dNone of the women I interviewed spoke of their profession as a social service, and they often expressed disgust for their male clients. Evaggelia, the madam where Elena works, said of the men: \u201cThey\u2019re not worthy enough of a girlfriend. They think that by paying 20 euros, they buy something.\u201dAll the women insisted on using only one name because of the stigma and for safety reasons. None said that she had been forced \u2014 except by necessity \u2014 to be there. But none wanted to be here.\u201cI hate sex,\u201d Elena said. \u201cI like the money, not the job.\u201dAnastasia, known as \u201cAmazon\u201d to clients, has worked as a prostitute since she was 14. She\u2019s now 33, and says the work is harder than ever.\u201cPeople don\u2019t have money anymore,\u201d she said one afternoon in Satovriandou Street outside a hotel named Easy Access, where clients have sessions that last from 10 minutes to a half-hour.Anastasia says they promise, \u201cI\u2019ll come when I get paid,\u201d or they ask for bargains. Men often ask for unprotected sex, she said, and many prostitutes who are drug addicts take on such clients for less than 10 euros.\u201cThe ones that do it have AIDS, so they don\u2019t care, they\u2019re even doing it for vengeance,\u201d according to Anastasia, who is in rehabilitation for drug addiction. \u201cBut they\u2019ve destroyed the market.\u201dThe number of H.I.V. cases in Greece has actually dropped since 2012, when intravenous drug use was rampant during the height of the financial crisis, said Dimitra Paraskeva, the head of Greece\u2019s H.I.V. office. Greece had 628 H.I.V. cases last year, almost half the number from six years ago, according to official data.In the cheaper Athenian brothels of Metaxourgio, I met Monica, a 30-year-old Albanian prostitute who grew up in the northern city of Thessaloniki. She said she entered the business 10 years ago, when she lived in Crete. She moved to Athens five years ago, in search of a new life, and initially worked in a taverna.She had completed one year toward a culinary degree to become a cook and wanted to use her earnings to pay for a second year \u2014 but her boss never paid her a salary.\u201cI came here,\u201d she said of the brothel, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the only job that, once you do it, you know you\u2019ll get paid.\u201dToday, she spends six to eight hours a day trying to entice clients, but most do not stay.\u201cThey don\u2019t have money,\u201d she said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t had money for the past seven years.\u201dWhen she does get a client, she charges 10 euros for 10 minutes, and is allowed to keep half.\u201cA few years ago, they used to tip,\u201d Monica said. \u201cThey\u2019d give you 20 and 50, even 100 euros if they liked it. Now, no more tips.\u201dWith the Greek crisis, the clientele changed, too, the women noted. They are now largely migrants, many who live in the apartments above the brothels in the gritty, low-rent areas. Many Greek men are simply too poor to pay anymore.\u201cTheir wages used to be 800 or 900 euros,\u201d Monica said. \u201cNow they get nothing.\u201dBesides the increase in migrant clients, Mr. Lazos\u2019s research pointed to an uptick of about 5 percent in Greek clientele between 2012 and 2017.\u201cIt\u2019s something that a man can\u2019t quit,\u201d Manolis, a 33-year-old taxi-driver and brothel regular who insisted on being identified only by his first name, whispered one afternoon on Filis Street. A small white light was on outside several doors left half-opened, a signal to roaming clients that a prostitute was available.\u201cSex is like smoking,\u201d Manolis said. \u201cYou\u2019ll find 20 euros for it, one way or another.\u201dDespite the drop in prices, customers have become choosier.\u201cSeven or eight years ago, 20 to 30 men would go to the bedroom with the girl,\u201d said Vaso, 65, who has been a madam for the past 20 years. Today, she said, it is more like five or six.\u201cNow they come, take a look,\u201d she said, \u201cand say, \u2018I\u2019ll be back.\u2019 \u201dAdvertisement"}

Mr. Quinn is a United States Army veteran.The problem is that our civilian leaders, and most of our population, have no skin in the game, and there\u2019s an ever-growing deference to the opinion of senior military leaders (many now wearing suits instead of fatigues) when it comes to foreign policy. My hope is that our leaders don\u2019t act like a 21-year-old from Brooklyn who wants to avenge his brother\u2019s death, but that they will be the adults in the room, develop a grand strategy to protect the U.S., our allies and our interests and not fall for the sunk-cost fallacy, where we are continuing to invest in Afghanistan because of costs already incurred.On the other side of the coin, which can be harder to admit, war has also changed me for the better. In a word, it probably comes down to perspective. The problems we face as Americans may seem difficult. They are not. When you witness Afghans struggle with food, shelter and security, it's difficult to get upset about the Wi-Fi not working on a JetBlue flight that was delayed two hours. It also taught me that our relationships are the most important things in life. The family and friends I lost to war make me cherish every moment I get to spend with the people I love. It also made me braver and bolder. Before, I would never have had the guts to submit an Op-Ed to The New York Times. Yesterday, I went with my husband, a Vietnam veteran, to the V.A. hospital in Madison, Wis. I urge people to go to a V.A. hospital sometime. You see firsthand young and old soldiers who have given their lives in one way or another, and still pay a price, physically or emotionally.I see that in some bizarre iterations, Vietnam now counts among our \u201cvictories.\u201d Let\u2019s not forget that in many wars, the United States owned the skies and still couldn\u2019t manage a victory. The brilliant new plan for Afghanistan, announced during the 2016 election, doesn\u2019t seem to be much better than any of the previous plans, or much different. Nor will the outcome, I dare to predict. Q: Can any side be truly victorious in a war? Are there any sacrifices, including your own, that could be justified by a victory?I will not address my sacrifices, as they pale in comparison to the sacrifices of friends who have given life, limb and mind to the cause, but we shouldn\u2019t use the word victory. Instead, use words like \u201cstrategy\u201d and \u201cattainable objectives.\u201d Over the course of 17 years and three administrations, our senior leaders have failed to give our troops a sound strategy with attainable objectives and a clear exit plan.Q: If we pull out of the war in Afghanistan, are we accepting defeat? How do you see the U.S. stepping out of the conflict? Is there a peaceful way forward?You also mentioned that if we left, ISIS would take safe haven under a friendly Taliban regime, but the truth is that the Taliban hate ISIS more than we do. Additionally, we continue to fear a safe haven for Al Qaeda, but Al Qaeda has had a safe haven in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border for the last 17 years. Osama bin Laden lived comfortably in a suburban town of Pakistan called Abbottabad, where his home was a stone\u2019s throw away from the Pakistan Military Academy. Let\u2019s be clear that Al Qaeda was the terrorist organization with the international ambition to strike the U.S. with 15 of its hijackers coming from Saudi Arabia. It wasn\u2019t the Taliban. Although not ideal (war never is), there will be a continuing clash between the Taliban and the current Afghan government, and it\u2019s up to the Afghan people to decide their destiny, without a kid from Brooklyn being in the middle of it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Our Beliefs Don\u2019t Predict Much About the Economy", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewThe more we learn about how people really think, the more we must rethink economic theory.Changes in fundamental beliefs play a major role in the fluctuations of the economy. That\u2019s the implication of two fascinating new studies that show how people systematically change their beliefs in thinking about the financial future. At the moment, the knowledge that economists have accumulated about this subject suggests that we should have a high degree of humility \u2014 not only in forecasting where we are going, but in describing where we have been.Before financial tremors began to be felt in 2006, practically no one viewed a crisis of the magnitude of the Great Depression as being remotely possible, these authors say. The financial crisis changed that perspective, and people have continued to worry about this newly discovered threat, with the result that risk-taking has been inhibited and government-controlled interest rates \u2014 so-called riskless rates \u2014 have remained relatively low.The scholars show that after an outlier event like the 2008 financial crisis occurs, standard statistical techniques show a sudden and persistent increase in the probability that such an event will occur again.Now that such a financial crisis is forever in our data set, it is rational, they say, to continue to worry about another such crisis, even decades later. Those worries can hold back the economy.Consider what this means for housing.The real (inflation-corrected) S&P/CoreLogic/Case-Shiller National Home Price Index fell 36 percent from 2005 to 2012. Going all the way back to 1890, home prices had never fallen so sharply.Before 2008, people might have rationally given the likelihood of such a fall a zero probability. Now that we have experienced it, the probability will never be zero again.These scholars are correct, but the situation, in my view, is even worse than they imply. That\u2019s because there is evidence from behavioral economics that people are not entirely logical, and do not actually rely fully on logic or standard statistical techniques.Focusing on the stock market, Professor Gennaioli and Professor Shleifer demonstrate how changeable expectations for the future really are. People tend to believe that recent trends will continue, whatever they may be, and then, when things shift, they change their expectations again.But Professor Gennaioli and Professor Shleifer also showed that these expectations for future returns were systematically wrong, showing no ability to predict what actually happened.Diagnostic beliefs work like this: A physician, in trying to diagnose a patient\u2019s illness, orders a blood test that reliably gives a positive result for all patients who have a certain disease. Unfortunately, the test also gives many false positives. It is easy to assume the patient has the disease. But the test may just be a false positive.The market boom leading to the 2008 financial crisis was the result of mistaken beliefs like the doctor\u2019s diagnostic errors, the researchers say. These diagnostic beliefs were based on what seemed to be a \u201ckernel of truth,\u201d Professors Gennaioli and Shleifer say: Investors had a high return in the market. But they exaggerated the meaning of that kernel of truth, creating a market bubble.More broadly, fundamental beliefs about the economy change through time. Thus, for example, the remarkable performance in the United States stock market since 2009 and in the housing market since 2012 are a result of a newly emergent belief system, reinforced not just by presidential statements or even by tax cuts but by a psychological dynamic that operates according to well-defined psychological principles, based, erroneously, on the belief that past growth in market prices is strong positive evidence for more growth in the near future.The problem for economics research today is to try to clarify these changing belief systems, their impact on the economy, and their duration. Further study may well show that the economic effects of beliefs founded on false premises can be profound for decades after the initial changes take place.Robert J. Shiller is Sterling Professor of Economics at Yale.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Wall Street Loves These Risky Loans. The Rest of Us Should Be Wary. ", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA financial assembly line that went haywire a decade ago and contributed to an economic crisis is gearing up again on Wall Street.This time around, a similar kind of investment, called C.L.O.s, are at the heart of the boom. And that\u2019s not the only parallel: The loans are being made to risky borrowers, lending standards are dropping fast, and regulators are easing the rules. While it isn\u2019t necessarily destined to end in a 2008-style collapse, the situation today is eerily familiar. Even top Federal Reserve policymakers cited the surging growth of this market as a reason to \u201cremain mindful of vulnerabilities\u201d and possible risks to the financial system.\u201cIf there turns out to be an issue, this is where the unfinished business of the post-crisis financial reform efforts is going to be revealed,\u201d said Daniel K. Tarullo, a professor at Harvard Law School and a former oversight governor for bank regulation at the Fed. The process of issuing loans, packaging them together and carving them into investments has many names: securitization, structured finance, even shadow banking.The last shadow-banking frenzy on Wall Street centered on home loans, which were repackaged into investments used to build collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.s. Banks pooled millions of mortgages \u2014 some of them to borrowers with a shaky ability to repay \u2014 to create C.D.O.s. They kept some, and the rest they sold off to a slew of other investors: in-house hedge funds, European banks, large American pension plans and more. The investments at play now are C.L.O.s, for collateralized loan obligations. But this time, the underlying loans aren\u2019t going to high-risk homeowners. They\u2019re going to high-risk companies. These C.L.O.s are made up of loans to between 100 and 300 already indebted corporate borrowers. Sears, which filed for bankruptcy this week, was among the companies that took what are called leveraged loans.Traditionally, such loan contracts would have all sorts of protections, known as covenants, aimed at providing investors an early warning that borrowers were getting in trouble. These covenants keep debtor companies from acting in ways that put payments to investors at risk. They restrict things like paying out dividends to owners, and put limits on additional borrowing. And when loans are repackaged and sold, most of the money effectively comes from the investors, not the banks. And there\u2019s a tendency to be less careful when lending other people\u2019s money. This incentive problem was at the heart of the lending that led to the last financial crisis. To fix that problem, the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law required the loan packagers to retain some of the risks of the investments they created. But those rules have been weakened this year. A court decision exempted some of the firms that create C.L.O.s from a requirement that they hold at least 5 percent of the credit risk in such investments. The Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission declined to appeal the decision. Right now, leveraged loans are some of the easiest products for financial firms to sell. Unlike most bond investments, which have fixed interest rates, leveraged loans typically have floating interest rates. Floating-rate products do better than most bonds when interest rates rise, and those rates have been climbing. As long as rates continue to push higher, there will be a demand for leveraged loans. But not everybody is thrilled with the idea of lending to already indebted companies, so financial engineers have transformed these loans into something more attractive. C.L.O.s, which have been around since the mid-1990s, are a type of asset-backed security, which is, essentially, a kind of bond. But unlike a regular bond, in which a single company repays interest and principal to bondholders, they combine multiple repayment streams \u2014 thousands of monthly credit card, auto loan or mortgage payments, for example \u2014 and funnel them to investors. Broadly speaking, here\u2019s how it works. A C.L.O. manager buys a diverse bunch of leveraged loans and simultaneously lines up investors who are willing to buy a piece of this package. Each quarter, the indebted companies make payments on those loans, and that money is channeled to the end investors.But C.L.O. investors aren\u2019t all the same. They get to pick what is more important to them: low-risk returns or big payday potential.Let\u2019s imagine that the proceeds from C.L.O.s are a pizza that arrives each quarter. Those who are first in line take only a small amount of pizza: Low risk, low reward.The investors at the end of the line take what\u2019s left when everyone else has eaten. This is risky: If only a small pie comes to the door, there\u2019s a chance that there won\u2019t be any when it\u2019s their turn. Right now, there is more than enough pizza for everybody at the party. The American economy is strong. Gross domestic product grew at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter. Unemployment is near 50-year lows. Corporate earnings are high. That means most of the companies that took out these loans are having no trouble with their payments. In fact, defaults on leveraged loans are quite low. The good times can\u2019t last forever, but that doesn\u2019t mean C.L.O.s will bring down the economy.The size of the C.L.O. market is only about one-tenth the size of the American mortgage market during the years before the crisis a decade ago.But it\u2019s not exactly small, either. The market for leveraged loans is larger than the market for junk bonds. And blowups in the junk bond market \u2014 most notably in the late 1980s \u2014 have caused problems before. And while people in the C.L.O. business point out that these assets fared pretty well during the last recession, nobody knows how the investments will perform when the next downturn comes.All of that makes the C.L.O. business a prime example of the type of finance that has fueled bubbles, booms and busts in recent years. \u201cMaybe this would be just a bad recession when this collapses, not the Great Depression,\u201d said Simon Johnson, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be as bad,\u201d he added. \u201cBut it could still be bad.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Campaign\u2019s Homestretch, Trump Tosses Out Ideas to See What Sticks", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisAd hoc though they may be, Mr. Trump\u2019s red-meat ideas have come to shape the conversation and, he hopes, may galvanize otherwise complacent conservative voters to turn out on Tuesday. But he risks motivating opponents, as well, and he has put even some of his fellow Republicans on the spot as they are forced to take a position on issues they were not expecting to have to address.Within hours of his promise to end birthright citizenship, some Republicans were denouncing the idea or distancing themselves from it. \u201cWell, you obviously cannot do that,\u201d Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin told WVLK, a radio station in Lexington, Ky. \u201cI\u2019m a believer in following the plain text of the Constitution, and I think in this case, the 14th Amendment is pretty clear.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States\u201d and is entitled to \u201call of those benefits,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s ridiculous. And it has to end.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s surprise proposal is the latest he has introduced with Election Day approaching. He recently announced that he would introduce a new plan to cut taxes for the middle class by 10 percent, a statement that caught other Republicans by surprise.At first, he said Congress would pass it before the midterm elections even though lawmakers had recessed for the campaign and had no plans to return to Washington before the vote. Then he said he would push for passage next year, although even aides could not describe what he had in mind.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.His focus on the caravan in Mexico has also inflamed the election debate. At rallies, he has depicted the group of migrants as a dire threat to the United States and vowed to make this the caravan campaign, accusing Democrats of favoring \u201copen borders\u201d and even suggesting that they were behind the movement of thousands of Central Americans. He ordered 5,200 troops to the border this week in a show of strength and promised to build tent cities to detain asylum seekers.\u201cThis has nothing to do with elections,\u201d Mr. Trump told Laura Ingraham on Fox News on Monday night. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been saying this long before election \u2014 I\u2019ve been saying this before I ever thought of running for office. We have to have strong borders. If we don\u2019t have strong borders, we don\u2019t have a country.\u201dThe birthright executive order caught even the president\u2019s supporters by surprise. Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, who supports ending birthright citizenship and argues that Mr. Trump does have the power to do so on his own authority, said the rollout of the planned executive order was \u201csloppy\u201d and ultimately counterproductive.\u201cIt would have been nice if they did this a month from now or two months ago so it\u2019s not right before an election,\u201d Mr. Krikorian said. \u201cTwo months ago, they could have prepared talking points and sent them out, and then staffers to congressmen could read them and decide what they\u2019re supposed to say. A month from now, it would not happen right before an election.\u201d He added, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t strike me as the best way to run a railroad.\u201dMichael Waldman, the president of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law and a former White House speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, said Mr. Trump seemed to be making stuff up as he went without any kind of vetting.\u201cThe executive order is flatly unconstitutional. It\u2019s pretend,\u201d he said. \u201cThe tax cut is pretend. Sending troops to the border is expensive theater. Trump is throwing out these ever wilder ideas in the hope to dominate the news. Perhaps there will be method to the madness if he can shape the debate the week before the election. Just as likely, though, the escalating craziness will remind voters of what they don\u2019t like about the president.\u201dAlfonso Aguilar, the president of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, said that in pushing immigration in the closing days of the campaign, Mr. Trump was looking for short-term political gain that could cost Republicans in the long run.\u201cIt helps him politically, and he\u2019s looking particularly at Senate races where it could help energize a part of his base that\u2019s mostly anti-immigrant and restrictionist,\u201d Mr. Aguilar said. But, he added, \u201cthis continues to fuel the problem the G.O.P. has with Hispanic voters.\u201dDavid Winston, a Republican strategist who advises the House and Senate leadership, said the president\u2019s discussion of immigration plays to the base, but wave elections like those in 1994, 2006 and 2010 have been won by persuading independents, who care more about the economy.\u201cYes, you\u2019ve got these other issues that motivate the base, but neither party\u2019s base is large enough to win,\u201d he said. The political middle would decide control of Congress. \u201cThat is the audience, and that\u2019s the audience that\u2019s focused on the economy.\u201dThe economic numbers right now are good, Mr. Winston added, but the question is whether voters feel they are finally breaking free of a paycheck-to-paycheck lifestyle.\u201cWe\u2019ll find out a week from now,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

Even people with jobs often cycle on and off assistance as work comes and goes, or to plug the gaps when it just doesn\u2019t pay enough. These programs allow people to remain healthy and solvent \u2014 supporting their independence. This rule therefore hurts everyone, not just immigrants, by stigmatizing the safety net funded by all of us to help people survive when they fall on hard times.These families would most likely chafe at the idea that they aren\u2019t independent or self-sufficient. They\u2019re working and trying to earn a decent living. But given the way our low-wage, service sector economy functions \u2014 offering erratic, stingy jobs \u2014 it\u2019s often not enough to survive. So families patch together the holes in their finances with the threads of our safety net.Under the administration\u2019s new rule, any immigrant who needed this kind of help \u2014 food stamps when work dries up, Medicaid and rental vouchers when it doesn\u2019t stretch far enough \u2014 could be denied an extension of their stay or a more permanent status because of that need. By making such a change and labeling these people \u201cpublic charges,\u201d the administration is signaling even to the native born that using government programs as stopgap measures makes you a leech on the system.The Department of Homeland Security estimates that the deterrent effect of this rule would result in immigrants forgoing $2.3 billion in federal and state benefits a year, benefits that they would otherwise be eligible for. The department does not estimate how many other Americans will be pushed away from these programs because of the potential stigma. But if the rule becomes federal policy, it\u2019s hard to see how anyone would feel the right to use the social safety net.Bryce Covert (@brycecovert) is a contributor at The Nation and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In a Year of Women Running for Governor, One Incumbent Finds a Tough Fight", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPORTLAND, Ore. \u2014 The last Republican governor of Oregon left the State Capitol more than 30 years ago. Yet Gov. Kate Brown, the latest Democrat to hold the office, suddenly finds herself facing a serious challenge from a Republican as she seeks re-election.\u201cThis is shocking,\u201d said Britt Howard, 36, a small-business owner in Portland who grew up in the state and has seen her share of governor\u2019s races. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty big deal that it\u2019s so neck and neck,\u201d Ms. Howard said. \u201cI\u2019ve always felt it was on lockdown \u2014 Oregon is going to have a Democratic governor. It\u2019s like a no-brainer.\u201dMs. Brown\u2019s vulnerability in a divided but decidedly Democratic-leaning state has puzzled voters on both sides of the political spectrum, and especially women. Democrats control six of the seven spots in Oregon\u2019s delegation to Congress, including both United States Senate seats, all of the partisan statewide elected offices except secretary of state, and both chambers of the state legislature.In interviews with several dozen voters in recent days in the Portland area, people suggested that Ms. Brown\u2019s re-election struggle may be less a reflection of some broader partisan shift in the state, and more about the details of her time in office. Some voters said Ms. Brown had not done enough to improve the state\u2019s fiscal condition, while others tie her closely to her Democratic predecessor, John Kitzhaber, who resigned amid a scandal three years ago. Still others said that Oregon Democrats, so used to winning, had grown complacent about the race.\u201cShe\u2019s been ineffective,\u201d said Linda Giesbers, 59, a registered nurse who was eating takeout yogurt at a bus-stop in Hillsboro, a suburb west of Portland. Ms. Giesbers, who said she would probably vote for Mr. Buehler, said that the state\u2019s public pension system was in shambles and Democrats like Ms. Brown were beholden to labor unions.Democratic-leaning voters like Sharon Soliday, the founder and chief executive of the Hello Foundation, a speech and occupational therapy company, said she thought Ms. Brown was hitting headwinds because of inequities in how Oregon has changed in recent years. The economy has boomed, especially in Portland, Ms. Brown\u2019s hometown, Ms. Soliday said, but problems have also festered \u2014 including weak and underfunded schools, homelessness, and rural poverty, she said.\u201cI think things are not necessarily better in Oregon, and that\u2019s a point of frustration for many folks,\u201d said Ms. Soliday, who said she planned to vote for Ms. Brown. Whoever wins the governor\u2019s race has difficult choices ahead: A big state budget deficit, driven in part by an underfunded pension system for public employees, is looming next year. \u201cWe\u2019re still looking at cutting services \u2014 potentially dramatically \u2014 because we just don\u2019t have the funds, and so I think Kate\u2019s also up against that,\u201d Ms. Soliday added.Anne Caravone, 73, and her husband Albert, 74, who live in Hillsboro, said that recent political protests in Portland, some of which grew violent or destructive, had disturbed and frightened them, and left them questioning Democratic control of so many offices across the state. Ms. Caravone, who said she tends to vote for Republicans, said she was undecided in her vote for governor, but had ruled out Ms. Brown. Mr. Caravone said he was leaning toward Mr. Buehler, but in the end might leave that part of his ballot blank.Mr. Kitzhaber had an unquestioned, if sometimes mocked, star power, often looking like he had stepped out of a Ralph Lauren ad, wearing an almost constant uniform of cowboy boots, jeans and a sport jacket.By contrast, Ms. Brown, who is 58 and the nation\u2019s first openly bisexual governor, leans toward what one supporter called a \u201cPortland anti-style,\u201d \u2014 plain clothes, sensible shoes and clunky glasses that tend to slide down her nose. As secretary of state, Ms. Brown was first in the line of succession to Mr. Kitzhaber since Oregon has no lieutenant governor. Then Ms. Brown won a special election in 2016. This is her first time seeking a full four-year term.\u201cI\u2019ve heard people say, \u2018I don\u2019t feel energized by her,\u2019\u201d said Ms. Howard, who said she plans to vote for Ms. Brown. \u201cPeople don\u2019t say that about male candidates,\u201d Ms. Howard added.Mr. Buehler, an orthopedic surgeon, has made the pitch to voters that he would be a pragmatist governor, aiming to address Oregon\u2019s problems the way he was trained as a doctor \u2014 diagnosing issues and addressing them with logic, not partisanship. His television ads have attacked Ms. Brown\u2019s performance on everything from the state\u2019s handling of mental health to child welfare.Mr. Buehler also has had an influential supporter in Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, one of the state\u2019s largest private employers. Mr. Knight gave $2.5 million to the Buehler campaign, more than 20 percent of its total.Supporters of Ms. Brown said that she has long been underestimated in public life, ever since her time in the Legislature, where she was the first female Senate majority leader in state history.Some Democrats said the new talk of a close race was exactly what Ms. Brown needed. Uncertainty, they said, would energize Democrats.\u201cShe\u2019s a survivor,\u201d said Therese Young, 70, a substitute teacher, who said she registered this year as a Democrat after a lifetime of voting as an independent.Dawn Heutte, an accountant, was walking through Portland\u2019s Pioneer Courthouse Square on a recent lunch hour with her daughter Hannah, who is 15. Ms. Heutte strongly supports Ms. Brown; Hannah, who said her debate team and government class have been focusing on the election, said she would probably vote for Mr. Buehler if she were old enough.\u201cHe\u2019s pretty moderate,\u201d Hannah said.\u201cHis stands on different things have changed,\u201d her mother responded.\u201cI think a lot of Democrats assume they\u2019re going to win, so they\u2019re not going to come out, and if Buehler wins that\u2019s going to be why,\u201d Hannah said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazil Can\u2019t Afford to Ignore Its Dire Economic Outlook", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNeither of the two presidential candidates has offered a comprehensive plan for an increasingly shaky economy.Dr. de Bolle is the director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins University.Driven by anger, resentment and a desire to obliterate the establishment, Brazilians chose on Sunday two presidential candidates at the extreme ends of the ideological spectrum. Jair Bolsonaro, a hard-right firebrand who has spoken fondly of the country\u2019s bygone military dictatorship, and the left-wing Fernando Haddad, from the corruption-mired Brazil\u2019s Worker\u2019s Party, will now face off in a second round of voting on Oct. 28. The economy has not fully recovered from the recession of 2015-16, the worst ever to hit the country. Growth has resumed, but not enough to create jobs for the more than 13 million unemployed Brazilian workers. Inflation has been contained, despite recent financial market turbulence, but wages are stagnant. Most ominous, Brazil has high and uncontrolled deficits and a debt-to-G.D.P. ratio that are unsustainable. These challenges require comprehensive action: spending cuts and tax increases, accompanied by pension reform. Without urgent moves, debt could reach 100 percent of G.D.P. in the next two years, leaving the government unable to finance itself. A fiscal crisis would tip the country back into recession, slashing even more jobs in an already grim labor market.Mr. Bolsonaro or Mr. Haddad will have no choice but to face up to this dire outlook. But so far, neither candidate seems willing to do so. Although austerity could hurt growth in the short term, the only way to reduce the widening gap between revenues and expenditures is by paying the price of a weaker economy now to guarantee the return of stability and growth later. The politics of the moment will complicate this prescription.  The next president will face a highly fragmented Congress; 30 political parties will have seats in the next session, up from 28. And neither candidate has the right political experience to build stable coalitions.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s party, the Social Liberal Party, known as the PSL, made big gains Sunday, winning 52 seats to the lower house of Congress. It\u2019s now the second biggest party in Congress, behind Mr. Haddad\u2019s PT. And Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters also look likely to win governorships in key states, such as S\u00e3o Paulo and Minas Gerais, Brazil\u2019s most populous state, in the runoff on Oct. 28. But Mr. Bolsonaro has promised to halve the number of cabinet positions to reduce costs, and this may hurt his ability to forge a stable coalition. Brazil has some 29 cabinet posts \u2014 much too many. Coalitions are built by handing off cabinet jobs to allied parties. If there are fewer cabinet positions on offer, the incentive for political parties to align with the president is lowered, making legislation much more difficult to pass. Mr. Haddad\u2019s PT holds 56 seats in Congress, a decrease from 2014 but still the most in Congress. As president, he would face hostility from Bolsonaro-supporting governors, who have a lot of influence in Congress, helping to shape policies or hampering reform. Mr. Haddad, if elected, would also have to confront anger toward his party for recent corruption scandals. Many former members of PT\u2019s leadership are in prison, including former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Despite these political challenges, we still have little idea what the candidates would do for the economy, less than three weeks from the runoff. In previous elections, candidates presented comprehensive economic plans. Not this time. Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. Haddad have been vague and general when discussing the economy. To be fair, Brazilian voters have been mainly concerned about corruption and violence. Rio de Janeiro, which hosted the Olympic Games in 2016, has had such a spike in violence that federal government ordered a military intervention. Brazilians have wanted to hear candidates\u2019 plans for cleaning up the government and restoring law and order.Mr. Bolsonaro, in choosing a prominent, pro-market chief economic adviser, has hinted that he plans to embrace a more liberal economic philosophy. But he is known to have nationalistic views, with a preference for state intervention to drive growth \u2014 not unlike policies that the PT has pursued in the recent past. Some observers appear to believe that his views have changed \u2014 but in the absence of detailed plans, there\u2019s little reason to believe that. Mr. Haddad has also failed to offer much substance. Although he has vowed to study the pension crisis, he has not recognized that reform is necessary. Moreover, he has defended the need for a strong public investment program to create jobs, but he has not explained where the money will come from. Mr. Haddad has talked loosely about the need for tax reform, but there\u2019s no clarity on what measures it would entail. It is likely that he would need to bow to the wishes of the left-wing PT leadership and thus avoid politically unpopular fiscal reforms. Following Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s strong showing on Sunday, the currency rallied and stock markets rose. Markets dipped on Wednesday, as they did around the globe, but enough investors appear to believe that Mr. Bolsonaro, if elected, will deliver pension and fiscal reform. Yet we don\u2019t have good reason to be sure. No matter what happens on Oct. 28, the economic outlook is bleak. Brazil\u2019s problems are far from over, and the two presidential candidates don\u2019t appear to have the plans or the political capital to make the necessary reforms. There is still too little to cheer in Latin America\u2019s largest economy.Monica de Bolle is the director of Latin American Studies at Johns Hopkins University.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Unknowable Fallout of China\u2019s Trade War Nuclear Option", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookChina holds more than a trillion dollars in United States debt, and an escalating trade war could tempt it to wield that debt in a way that has long been unthinkable. It is often called the nuclear option. In the trade war between the United States and China, economists and investors have long tried to game out how both sides might use their clout. In virtually all the predictions, at least until recently, they revolved around a tit-for-tat tariff war.Even in the gloomiest of doomsday scenarios, there is one weapon that has long been considered unthinkable: the Chinese, the biggest holder of United States foreign debt with more than $1 trillion, publicly taking a step back from buying United States Treasuries \u2014 or worse, dumping what they own in the open market. The very idea is typically dismissed as a waste of time to even consider, and the reason is a sort of mutually assured destruction. It would be wildly irrational in economic terms, the thinking goes. China selling Treasuries would send interest rates up and hurt the United States, but it would simultaneously severely damage the value of China\u2019s own Treasury holdings. As the industrialist J. Paul Getty famously said, \u201cIf you owe the bank $100, that\u2019s your problem; if you owe the bank $100 million, that\u2019s the bank\u2019s problem.\u201d In the United States-China relationship, China is very clearly the bank.And it is worth remembering that Beijing\u2019s endgame is not necessarily to ensure the financial health of its country this year or the next. If China were to suffer short-term pain to gain a real and lasting advantage over the United States \u2014 or at least not lose any advantages it does have \u2014 it might be willing to struggle a bit today.\u201cThe negotiation between the two great powers isn\u2019t about how many soybeans or Boeing airplanes they buy by the end of the year,\u201d said Kevin Warsh, a former governor of the Federal Reserve. \u201cWe are at a pivotal moment in history. The actions of the U.S. and Chinese governments in the next 12 months will set the course for the relationship of the two great powers of the 21st century.\u201dStill, critics who dismiss the possibility of China trying to upend the United States Treasury market say that China\u2019s own economy is too fragile to risk doing anything that would cause instability. Stability has long been a watchword in China. Over the weekend, China\u2019s central bank, clearly nervous about a slowdown, pumped $175 billion into the economy by lowering the amount of money that some lenders are required to hold in reserve, allowing that money to circulate freely instead.Supporters of the Trump administration\u2019s tough stance on tariffs with China take actions like that as a sign that the United States holds the negotiating leverage. And it remains an open question whether China could inflict real damage by selling Treasuries. \u201cTreasuries sales in a sense are easy to counter, as the Fed is very comfortable buying and selling Treasuries for its own account,\u201d wrote Brad W. Setser, a senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cI have often said that the U.S. ultimately holds the high cards here: The Fed is the one actor in the world that can buy more than China can ever sell.\u201d Even so, the market dynamics are unpredictable. Chances are, over the past two decades, there have been Treasury auctions at which the Chinese haven\u2019t been bidders. But whether they were active bidders or not, the other bidders have always had to assume they were. It is one thing to show up at Sotheby\u2019s and not raise your paddle. It would be quite another to send out a news release saying you\u2019re never going to Sotheby\u2019s again. The problem is that China would have to find something to do with that money \u2014 and, in this case, the auction house is always offering the best deals in town.\u201cEven if it could sell its more than a trillion dollars of Treasurys without pushing the market against it, where would it park the funds?\u201d Marc Chandler, global head of currency strategy for Brown Brothers Harriman, wrote in a note to investors. \u201cIt will not be able to secure the liquidity, safety and returns that are available in the U.S.\u201d But brinkmanship does not breed rational thought. The escalation of hostilities, even economic ones, raises both stakes and tempers alike, which is a dangerous combination.And in this case, there is no proving ground. There is no predictable math, no scale model. If China were to use its nuclear option and the markets didn\u2019t react, it would lose influence in stark fashion. If it worked \u2014 but was more effective than expected \u2014 China could inflict unintended damage on its own economy. And even a perfectly executed strike that left China unharmed would be perilous: A targeted attack on the United States economy would have unknowable repercussions. If the fallout cloud settled over Europe or emerging markets, would China be ready for that fight, too?Since the end of the Cold War and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, the world has embraced a policy of strategic stability: reducing the incentive for rival nations to unleash unimaginable destruction.That is probably good economic policy, too.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Officer Is Extradited to U.S. to Face Charges of Economic Espionage", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 A Chinese intelligence official was arrested in Belgium and extradited to the United States to face espionage charges, Justice Department officials said on Wednesday, a major escalation of the Trump administration\u2019s effort to crack down on Chinese spying.The extradition on Tuesday of the officer, Yanjun Xu, a deputy division director in China\u2019s main spy agency, the Ministry of State Security, is the first time that a Chinese intelligence official has been brought to the United States to be prosecuted and tried in open court. Law enforcement officials said that Mr. Xu tried to steal trade secrets from companies including GE Aviation outside Cincinnati, in Evendale, Ohio, one of the world\u2019s top jet engine suppliers for commercial and military aircraft.A 16-page indictment details what appears to be a dramatic international sting operation to lure Mr. Xu to what he believed was a meeting in Belgium to obtain proprietary information about jet fan blade designs from a GE Aviation employee, only to be met by Belgian authorities and put on a plane to the United States.China has for years used spycraft and cyberattacks to steal American corporate, academic and military information to bolster its growing economic power and political influence. But apprehending an accused Chinese spy \u2014 all others charged by the United States government are still at large \u2014 is an extraordinary development and a sign of the Trump administration\u2019s continued crackdown on the Chinese theft of trade secrets.The arrest of Mr. Xu \u201cshows that federal law enforcement authorities can not only detect and disrupt such espionage, but can also catch its perpetrators,\u201d Benjamin C. Glassman, the United States attorney for the Southern District of Ohio, said in a statement.The coming trial, in federal court in Cincinnati, could further expose China\u2019s methods for stealing trade secrets and embarrass officials in Beijing \u2014 part of what current and former administration officials said was a long-term strategy to make stealing secrets costly and shameful for China. Federal prosecutors will have to present additional evidence to prove their case, which could include intercepted communications between government officials or even testimony from cooperating witnesses.\u201cIf you can make it less expensive in terms of money and reputation to instead invest in R&D, the country\u2019s behavior can and will change,\u201d said John Carlin, the former head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division, referring to research and development.In the short term, the Justice Department\u2019s aggressive move is likely to worsen tensions as the United States and China engage in a tit-for-tat trade war. Should China respond to the arrest, current and former administration officials said, it is possible that the Chinese government will expel American diplomats or intelligence officers from Beijing.The indictment outlines China\u2019s courting of the GE Aviation employee starting in March 2017. The company, a subsidiary of General Electric, was a ripe target because it builds airplane and helicopter engines for the Pentagon.An individual identified as an unindicted co-conspirator invited the GE Aviation employee on an all-expense trip to China to meet with scientists at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Once there, the employee was introduced to Mr. Xu, who continued to be in touch by email after the trip.In January, Mr. Xu invited the employee back to China and told him that he should bring information about GE Aviation\u2019s \u201csystem specification, design process.\u201d Over the next two months, Mr. Xu asked the employee for more details, including what the indictment said was proprietary information about fan blade design.Mr. Xu and the GE Aviation employee discussed increasingly specific pieces of data that Mr. Xu wanted, and the employee even sent Mr. Xu a file directory of documents on the employee\u2019s company-issued laptop.The two never met again in China, but set up a meeting in Belgium for the employee to pass more secrets to Mr. Xu. In preparation for the employee\u2019s trip to Europe, Mr. Xu asked the employee if he would use an external thumb drive to transfer information from the employee\u2019s work computer when they met in person.It is unclear from the indictment if the employee at this point was cooperating with the F.B.I. as part of the sting operation, and it is unclear if the employee ever traveled to Belgium. On Wednesday, the Justice Department praised GE Aviation for its cooperation in the investigation and internal controls that the department said \u201cprotected GE Aviation\u2019s proprietary information.\u2019\u2019Mr. Xu was arrested on April 1 in Belgium and remained in custody there until Tuesday. He is now being held in Cincinnati.Employees of large American corporations traveling to countries like China are often targets for information theft because their devices can be hacked remotely and because they can speak too revealingly of their work while being wined and dined, said Joseph S. Campbell, the former head of the F.B.I.\u2019s criminal investigative division who is now a director at Navigant Consulting.\u201cEmployees who think they\u2019re sharing unimportant information don\u2019t realize that they\u2019re adding to a broad matrix of knowledge,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Campbell said. \u201cEven with unclassified information, China can put together a fuller picture of a company\u2019s sensitive information.\u201dThe government indictment against Mr. Xu leaves open the possibility that the government investigation is continuing. The document says that an unindicted co-conspirator referred to as CF brokered the meeting between Mr. Xu and the GE Aviation employee; it mentions that Mr. Xu was communicating with other Ministry of State Security agents about the spy operation.The Justice Department is pursuing other thefts of trade secrets for prosecution, said John C. Demers, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s National Security Division. Together, he said, they show that China has a policy of developing its economy to the detriment of the United States.\u201cThis case is not an isolated incident,\u201d Mr. Demers said. \u201cIt is part of an overall economic policy of developing China at American expense. We cannot tolerate a nation\u2019s stealing our firepower and the fruits of our brainpower.\u201dChina has also been targeting General Electric\u2019s turbine technology. The F.B.I. arrested in August a dual citizen of the United States and China who worked at General Electric, charging him with stealing the company\u2019s technology for the purpose of helping Chinese companies.Julian Barnes contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Wolfram Kaiser, a professor of European studies at the University of Portsmouth, said the United States and European capitals were bound closely by the Cold War, as well as political and economic interests. \u201cEuropean concerns were with reconstruction, overcoming national conflict, creating a peaceful organizational framework through economic integration and so on \u2014 not opposing the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Kaiser said.Desmond Dinan, a professor at George Mason University who has written several books on the European Union, also said Mr. Trump\u2019s statement was not correct. Mr. Dinan said there were a number of other political, economic and security reasons for European integration. They included attempts to increase growth and employment; end currency fluctuations and eradicate transaction costs; and enhance internal security through law enforcement cooperation.\u201cIn other words, what Trump has said could not be less true,\u201d Mr. Kaiser said.Today, the European Union is the United States\u2019 largest trading and investment partner, and the relationship is largely harmonious and mutually beneficial, despite some tensions, according to the Congressional Research Service.While the common market gives member states greater leverage in negotiations, the European Union \u201chas always used its trade policy to push for greater liberalization,\u201d Mr. Dinan said. \u201cThis has been the case consistently in the E.U.\u2019s relationship with the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, the E.U. and the U.S. have traditionally worked together to promote global trade liberalization.\u201dSources: European Union, Congressional Research Service, The New York Times, Wolfram Kaiser, Desmond Dinan Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Watch Out Workers, Algorithms Are Coming to Replace You \u2014 Maybe", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA.I. is still so new that it remains relatively unregulated. Does that worry you?There is no lack of dystopian scenarios in which A.I. emerges as a hero, but it can actually go wrong in so many ways. And this is why the only really effective form of A.I. regulation is global regulation. If the world gets into an A.I. arms race, it will almost certainly guarantee the worst possible outcome.China was really the first country to tackle A.I. on a national level in terms of focused, governmental thinking; they were the first to say \u201cwe need to win this thing\u201d and they certainly are ahead of the United States and Europeans by a few years.Have the Chinese been able to weaponize A.I. yet?Everyone is weaponizing A.I. Some countries are building autonomous weapons systems based on A.I., while others are focused on disinformation or propaganda or bots. It takes different forms in different countries. In Israel, for instance, we have one of the largest laboratories for A.I. surveillances in the world \u2014 it\u2019s called the Occupied Territories. In fact, one of the reasons Israel is such a leader in A.I. surveillance is because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Explain this a bit further.Part of why the occupation is so successful is because of A.I. surveillance technology and big data algorithms. You have major investment in A.I. (in Israel) because there are real-time stakes in the outcomes \u2014 it\u2019s not just some future scenario.Is there a limit to this shift?Well, A.I. is only as powerful as the metrics behind it.And who controls the metrics?Humans do; metrics come from people, not machines. You define the metrics \u2014 who to marry or what college to attend \u2014 and then you let A.I. make the best decision possible. This works because A.I. has a far more realistic understanding of the world than you do. It works because humans tend to make terrible decisions.But what if A.I. makes mistakes?The goal of A.I. isn\u2019t to be perfect, because you can always adjust the metrics. A.I. simply needs to do better than humans can do \u2014 which is usually not very hard.What remains the biggest misconception about A.I.?People confuse intelligence with consciousness; they expect A.I. to have consciousness, which is a total mistake. Intelligence is the ability to solve problems; consciousness is the ability to feel things \u2014 pain, hate, love, pleasure.Can machines develop consciousness?Well, there are \u201cexperts\u201d in science-fiction films who think you can, but no \u2014 there\u2019s no indication that computers are anywhere on the path to developing consciousness.Do we even want computers with feelings?So what\u2019s left that A.I. hasn\u2019t touched?In the short term, there\u2019s still quite a bit. For now, most of the skills that demand a combination between the cognitive and the manual are beyond A.I.\u2019s reach. Take medicine once again; if you compare a doctor with a nurse, it\u2019s far easier for A.I. to replace a doctor \u2014 who basically just analyzes data for diagnoses and suggests treatments. But replacing a nurse, who injects medications and changes bandages, is far more difficult. But this will change; we are really at the beginning of A.I.\u2019s full potential.So is the A.I. revolution almost upon us?Not exactly. We won\u2019t see this massive disruption in say, five or 10 years \u2014 it will be more of a cascade of ever-bigger disruptions.And how will this affect the work force?The economy is having to face ever-greater disruptions in the work force because of A.I. And in the long run, no element of the job market will be 100 percent safe from A.I. and automation. People will need to continually reinvent themselves. This may take 50 years, but ultimately nothing is safe.A.I. is forcing people to reinvent themselves. Can it also make the reinvention process less scary?A.I. can make the process both better and worse. Worse, because A.I. itself is compelling us to adapt; as A.I. develops, jobs disappear and people need to adapt professionally. On the other hand, A.I. can help revolutionize and customize education.How might this work?Instead of students being part of a big education cohort processed in the industrial way, you could work with an A.I. mentor who not just teaches you, but studies you, as well. The mentor gets to know your particular strengths and weaknesses \u2014 can learn if, say, you learn better with words or with images; through spatial metaphors or temporal metaphors. And then customizes education for you. Learning new skills can be very difficult after the age of 40. But even as A.I. forces people to reinvent themselves, it can help them get through this process far better than any human teacher.So has A.I. forced you to reinvent yourself?Well, writing about A.I. certainly has. A decade ago I was an anonymous professor writing about medieval history; today I am meeting with journalists and politicians and heads of state talking about cyborgs and A.I. I certainly had to reinvent myself along the way.Advertisement"}

It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin.

The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical.

{"Headline": "Satellites Aid the Chase for Better Information on Oil Supplies", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 In a wing of a massive former bank building here in the French capital, dozens of youthful women and men gather around computer screens. This collection of around 100 mathematicians, software engineers and petroleum analysts are bent on shaking up the opaque world of information on the world energy markets.On a recent day, one group was sifting satellite images for clues to oil output in Venezuela \u2014 once a major oil producer but now in decline. Another cluster was checking the levels of crude in a tank farm in China.\u201cI was amazed by the fact that the data that everyone was using to make decisions were incomplete facts and most of the time incorrect,\u201d Mr. Rostand said in an interview. \u201cThe largest industry in the world was making trillions of decisions \u2014 investments and trading and whatever \u2014 based on completely incorrect data.\u201dMr. Rostand was referring to a longstanding oil industry complaint about the quality and timeliness of industry statistics.Mr. Lynch said that at any given time there was likely to be some uncertainty about the exact number of barrels of oil being produced on any given day. That uncertainty \u2014 typically ranging from 500,000 to 1.5 million barrels a day \u2014 can affect the oil market, leading either to oil gluts or the draining of tank farms. Either can have a major impact on prices.That may not seem like a lot given that the world produces and consumes close to 100 million barrels a day, but it is a big number considering that over time, differences in supply and demand of that order can lead to either a rise or fall in inventories and impact prices.Oil industry statistics are largely furnished by government agencies. The numbers supplied by these departments are considered mostly reliable in the major industrialized countries, which make up about 50 percent of oil consumption. But much of the data is annoyingly slow to arrive.The rest of the world is \u201ca very, very patchy picture indeed,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said. For instance, the Paris organization and other analysts only manage to put together estimates of how much oil China, a major consumer, is using with \u201cdetective work,\u201d through extrapolating from trade and refinery figures and other clues, Mr. Atkinson said.As for the supply side, OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which accounts for about one-third of global oil output, is a \u201cbig black hole,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said. Wary of disclosure that could lead to embarrassments like owning up to cheating on agreed production ceilings, the OPEC member states have not \u201cproduced or published reliably transparent data for many, many years,\u201d Mr. Atkinson said.Kayrros is one of several firms trying to make money by using emerging technology to fill in pieces of the data jigsaw. Often these activities focus on giving traders an edge by providing advance forecasts of government data releases on matters like how much oil is in storage. Kayrros mostly focuses on satellite images, which are becoming more readily available at lower cost as satellite companies scan the planet with instruments that are smaller and less expensive through smartphone technology and other breakthroughs.Rather than pore over individual pictures, the company\u2019s computer scientists and analysts have developed programs that sift through an average of 10,000 images a day of tank farms, oil fields and other facilities and then flag developments that might give clients an edge.When it comes to divining how much oil countries like China have on hand, Kayrros turns to satellites that bounce radar probes off the tanks. Many storage tanks have floating roofs that rise and fall depending on the volume of oil they hold. The company\u2019s algorithms analyze the signals coming off the tanks to produce an estimate of the volumes they contain. Aggregating these numbers sheds light on how much oil China has on hand and may be consuming \u2014 increasingly important pieces of information for the markets.Mr. Rostand\u2019s troops also use programs to sift through social media posts and other chatter for energy news that could move markets. For instance, he says that through such tactics his analysts were able to detect a recent refinery explosion in Germany ahead of news outlets.Mr. Rostand said Kayrros, which raised $24 million from venture capitalists recently, is a start-up that is burning cash, but clients seem to like the combination of satellite surveillance and oil industry savvy.The company also maintains large numbers of sensors to check on flows through facilities like pipelines. It even mounted cameras near the California manufacturing plant of the electric car company Tesla to try to determine how many vehicles were coming off the line. \u201cWe create our own intelligence,\u201d said Clay Seigle, managing director for oil at the company.Both Kayrros and Genscape have substantial staffs and presumably charge accordingly for their products, though they declined to disclose their fees.\u201cThey are starting to go rogue,\u201d he said of the Iranians, though he said he doubted that sophisticated observers would be fooled. \u201cIt is quite silly of them to do this; they are going to be spotted anyway.\u201dMr. Madani said his group was able to work on a shoe string by choosing not to cover the whole industry, instead homing in on a few key areas. \u201cWe focus on hot spots of interest, and we try to provide the back story as well,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pickens, West Virginia, 8:40 A.M.", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "Documenting moments across the country, large and small, quiet and indelible.Supported byWhen this project was being conceived, a storm named Florence did not exist. It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L. Whitfield sermonized from the Gospel According to John. In one of the pews they built a dollhouse out of Bibles. Pastor Whitfield was baptized in the bayou that runs behind the church 54 years ago.

{"Headline": "Will Too Much Love From Trump Be a Bad Thing for a Long Island Congressman?", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySETAUKET, N.Y. \u2014 When he took office in 2015, Lee M. Zeldin wasted no time in carving out a reputation as a conservative firebrand in Congress, taking caustic, hard-line positions against the Obama administration and for Israel.The next year, when Donald Trump ran for president, Mr. Zeldin became an ardent supporter, establishing a relationship that has since paid dividends for the Republican congressman from Suffolk County, N.Y., on Long Island.When Mr. Zeldin kicked off his re-election campaign in June, two former Trump White House officials \u2014 Sebastian Gorka and Sean Spicer \u2014 were there. Mr. Trump was not, but he has since endorsed Mr. Zeldin, saying in a Twitter post last month that he was \u201cdoing a fantastic job.\u201dThe question, however, is whether too much love from Mr. Trump will be a bad thing for Mr. Zeldin.His Democratic opponent, Perry Gershon, is a first-time candidate, like many of the Democrats challenging incumbent Republican House members in New York.Only two of the races statewide are considered tossups; most of the newcomers fall in the long-shot category. Political prognosticators characterize the Zeldin-Gershon race as \u201clikely Republican,\u201d perhaps because the First Congressional District has 16,000 more registered Republicans than Democrats.But the campaign of Mr. Gershon, a former commercial real estate lender who lives in East Hampton, has lately gained momentum. His third-quarter donations topped $1.5 million, one of the biggest hauls in the state. And before Mr. Zeldin was elected in 2014, the district was for 12 years represented by Tim Bishop, a Democrat.\u201cGershon\u2019s chance to pull off the upset hinges upon the fact that the polls show there are choppy seas for both sides, but no partisan tide, whereas for two years Zeldin has acted like this district is a Trump island,\u201d said Bruce Gyory, a Democratic political consultant who is not involved in the race.\u201cThe irony,\u201d he added, \u201cis that this year, the voters seem to be in the same mood they were when they tossed Bishop out and elected Zeldin.\u201dWhile he jump-started his campaign with his own money (he put $1.3 million into the primary race), Mr. Gershon has since garnered widespread support among Democrats, aided by the groundswell of anti-Trump sentiment.And he has sought to portray Mr. Zeldin\u2019s sharp conservatism as out of touch with a district where, he said, many Republicans and Democrats consider themselves centrists. Mr. Zeldin\u2019s voting record, in Albany as a state legislator, and in Congress, leaves no doubt as to his views.He has voted against same-sex marriage, funding Planned Parenthood and the Dream Act, which would provide tuition assistance to undocumented immigrants. He voted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, to expand the right to carry concealed firearms anywhere in the country, and to permit Americans to deny services to same-sex couples on religious grounds.His scorecard includes a 9 percent from the League of Conservation Voters and an A from the National Rifle Association. Mr. Zeldin also opposed a bill that would help law enforcement prevent those on terror watch and no-fly lists from legally buying guns.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of interest in seeing Zeldin out,\u201d said Mr. Gershon, 56, a longtime marathon runner who grew up in Manhattan, attended the Dalton School and graduated from Yale University. \u201cI can\u2019t put it in better terms. He is a Trump sycophant.\u201dMr. Gershon said he had never considered running for office until he visited the United States Memorial Holocaust Museum in Washington during the presidential campaign.\u201cThe Holocaust Museum helped me see how some of the actions at Trump rallies were consistent with the birth of authoritarian Germany \u2014 the demeaning of the press, the denial of scientific fact and persecution of immigrants,\u201d said Mr. Gershon, who, like Mr. Zeldin, is Jewish. \u201cThat scared me because I had always grown up to believe that things like that would never happen in America.\u201dMr. Zeldin, a lawyer and former Army paratrooper who served in Iraq, has criticized Mr. Gershon for drawing a parallel between Mr. Trump and Nazi Germany, saying the comparison was \u201cunhinged and disgusting.\u201dBut during a recent campaign stop, Mr. Zeldin did not seem eager to talk about Mr. Gershon. At a meet-and-greet in Patchogue the other night, he avoided any mention of Mr. Gershon, instead exciting the gathering with put-downs of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.After spending a good 10 minutes discussing whether to get his twin 12-year-old daughters\u2019 cellphones and other topics unrelated to the campaign, Mr. Zeldin talked about issues. He reminded the voters that the country was on a strong path, with the economy on the rise and MS-13 on the run.A woman in attendance said through tears that Mr. Zeldin, 38, had saved the life of her son, who had fought in Iraq. That prompted the congressman to convey the importance of connecting veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder to other veterans \u2014 an idea that formed the basis of a program he established as a state senator.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.\u201cYou all give me a privilege of being able to go down to Washington, represent this district, to go down there fighting for our military, fighting for our vets and fighting important battles for the next generation,\u201d he said.As for swatting away the challenge from Mr. Gershon, Mr. Zeldin delegates that to his campaign staff, which is fond of referring to Mr. Gershon as \u201cPark Avenue Perry.\u201dChris Boyle, the campaign\u2019s communications director, portrayed Mr. Gershon as an inexperienced elitist and a carpetbagger.Mr. Gershon \u201cshould have run for his local community board in Manhattan, where he\u2019s actually from, rather than recently registering in NY-1 just to get crushed for all of the right reasons,\u201d Mr. Boyle said.Supporters of Mr. Zeldin, who lives in Shirley, do not seem overly worried about a blue wave. They cite the congressman\u2019s down-to-earth personality, his stance on issues ranging from gun rights to veterans and his support of Mr. Trump.\u201cHe\u2019s very personable and doesn\u2019t have any airs about him,\u201d Ruben Girona, a mortgage company executive who lives in Patchogue, said of Mr. Zeldin. \u201cHe\u2019s a straight shooter. He doesn\u2019t tell me what I want to hear. He tells me how it is.\u201dThe view was a bit different at a campaign event that Mr. Gershon held here with two dozen veterans to learn about their frustrations with the bureaucracy and services. Mr. Gershon, whose grandfather helped liberate the Dachau concentration camp in World War II, was heartened to learn that not every veteran supports Mr. Zeldin.\u201cI look for heart,\u201d said Ron Organ, 71, a Vietnam War veteran who lives in Middle Island. \u201cThat\u2019s the first thing I look for because without that, really nothing else matters. Perry Gershon has it. When something visible is going on, Zeldin is there. But when it comes to being in the trenches, he\u2019s not.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Far-Reaching Threats of a Conservative Court", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWill the Supreme Court wipe out the government protections that have shielded Americans from abusive business practices since the New Deal?Mr. Posner is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School. With the start of the Supreme Court\u2019s new term, many people are wondering whether the conservative majority, which has taken a further step to the right with the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh, will overturn Roe v. Wade. But that\u2019s not where the action is. As two cases argued before the court this month illustrate, the real question is whether it will undermine the system of government that has protected the public from abusive business practices since the New Deal.Liberals might root against the government \u2014 the immigration and sex offender policies are harsh. But they should be careful what they wish for. The conservative majority can, and most likely will, rule against the government using broad theories that would also eat away at the constitutional foundations of the New Deal system, which is essential for protecting health and safety, the environment and much else.The New Deal agencies initially encountered resistance from the Supreme Court, which was then, like now, a reactionary institution that frowned on novelty. For one thing, when agencies issue regulations, they make law, which was the traditional prerogative of Congress. Moreover, the agencies were mostly overseen by the White House, which is not supposed to make law. And Congress also gave many regulatory agencies some autonomy \u2014 protecting staff from removal, for example \u2014 that seemed to infringe on the president\u2019s authority to supervise the executive branch.Eventually, common sense prevailed over these legalistic objections. Congress itself lacked the capacity to engage in the detailed regulation that is necessary to keep a modern economy humming while protecting workers and consumers. Agencies were needed. The executive branch was the sensible place to house agencies because the agencies combined both policymaking and enforcement functions. And agencies need some protection from political meddling.By the 1980s, half a century after the New Deal, a political and legal consensus in favor of the administrative state had solidified. Left and right argued about how much regulation was needed, of course, but no one doubted the constitutional foundations of the administrative state \u2014 not even Justice Antonin Scalia, the leading conservative lawyer of the past half century and an academic expert on administrative law before he ascended to the bench.But Brett Kavanaugh is a skeptic. And so are Neil Gorsuch, Donald Trump\u2019s first appointment to the Supreme Court, and Clarence Thomas, who was appointed back in 1991. The views of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito are less clear, but their judicial opinions point in the same direction.The conservative assault on the administrative state has four elements.What is the basis for this radical change in the law? Justices Kavanaugh, Gorsuch and Thomas claim to be \u201coriginalists,\u201d who believe that the court should strike down laws that violate the original understanding of the Constitution. But the founders did not bar Congress from creating administrative agencies or think that the First Amendment protected businesses from commercial regulation.The answer is both obvious and depressing. The modern conservative jurisprudence is an exercise in nostalgia, a yearning for pre-New Deal America when, supposedly, government was less oppressive and people were freer than they are today. You can see this nostalgia in the homilies to olden times in Justices Gorsuch\u2019s and Kavanaugh\u2019s lectures \u2014 and their insistence that answers to today\u2019s challenges can be found in a theory of government invented in the 18th century by men wearing breeches and powdered wigs.This jurisprudence appeals to many people in a populist era that distrusts experts, chafes at bureaucracy, fears change and longs for a simpler past. But like so much being peddled by ideologues and partisans these days, it\u2019s a sham. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Thinking Clearly About Immigration", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Yet here we are in the throes of a bitter war over immigration. Everyone knows who the enemy is, or thinks he does: One side points at ethnonationalist racists who cheer budget-busting walls, Muslim bans, caged children and deportations of hard-working parents whose only crime is wanting a better life. The other side sees self-deluded elitist hypocrites who condone criminal border-crossing and extravagant social spending as a way of supplying cheap labor to look after their children and clean their homes \u2014 while telling an ailing, law-abiding white working class that its time is up.In a nutshell, Salam contends that while the United States should welcome more high-skilled immigrants, mass low-skilled immigration is swelling the number of poor people in a country that is struggling \u2014 with modest success at best \u2014 to fulfill the aspirations of the less privileged citizens already living here. In the past, poor immigrants entered a labor-hungry industrial economy; jobs, land and opportunities were plentiful. A range of midskilled jobs gave the children and grandchildren of those immigrants the chance to leave urban tenements and drought-ridden farms to assimilate into a thriving American middle class with a car in the garage and a summer vacation at an upstate lake. That trajectory was largely denied to the descendants of former slaves; now it is out of reach as well for a growing number of today\u2019s newcomers.Ignoring the broad public good for immediate compassion, \u201cimmigration optimists\u201d fail to fully reckon with the transformed economic landscape greeting this generation of arrivals. Wages are in the doldrums for all lower-skilled workers; stable work hours and savings accounts will remain a luxury for many of them. Salvadorans fleeing subsistence poverty and gangs may be grateful for the measly paycheck they get for chopping onions in steaming restaurant kitchens, but, Salam predicts, \u201cthe citizen children of these workers won\u2019t be nearly as quiescent.\u201d Given the hollowing out of the midskilled labor market and our mediocre record in educating poor children for a postindustrial economy, the rich, he says, are likely to remain \u201coverwhelmingly white\u201d for decades to come. He sees a future with a racialized proletariat embittered by a country that seems to work only for white Americans. This explains the alarmism of the \u201cCivil War\u201d of the book\u2019s title.For Salam, then, it\u2019s not diversity or majority-minority demographics that challenge the United States; it\u2019s \u201cextreme between-group inequality.\u201d Uplifting stories about the billionaire entrepreneur children of Russian refugees and DACA valedictorians prettify the reality of recent immigration just as much as dark visions of border-crossing rapists and welfare cheats do the opposite. There is a vast gap in the likely fortunes of the child of a Central American farmer with an eighth-grade education and that of the child of a professor from Mumbai. One of many studies quoted here concludes that only 6.2 percent of children of immigrants with less than a high school degree will graduate from college.The frequent claim that immigrants \u201cgrow the economy\u201d is also what fact-checkers would call only \u201cpartly true.\u201d Immigrants with a college degree or more do supplement the tax rolls; their less-educated counterparts, however, are a net drain. A little over 30 percent of native households with children get federal food assistance, but over 45 percent of immigrant-headed households do. Meanwhile, the costs for education, social services and a considerable portion of Medicaid fall heavily on states and localities.No doubt, \u201cMelting Pot or Civil War?\u201d will leave many immigration restrictionists unconvinced that enforcement would ever be adequately \u201cresolute.\u201d Some progressives will accuse Salam of underplaying the racial animus driving poverty among immigrants. Others will note that low-skilled immigration is already on the wane. Still, this bracing book could be a conversation-changer \u2014 if only the outraged on both sides would let it.Kay Hymowitz is the William E.

And yet Coral noted something significant: Despite its stance on climate science, the Trump administration formally approved the document. In the world of diplomacy, it sends a signal that even the Trump administration might not be willing to publicly buck the conclusions of the world\u2019s top climate scientists.Are any governments prepared to make the radical transformations in energy, agriculture and transportation that the United Nations scientific group, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, says are needed? The newest financial supporter of a plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the biggest energy company in the world: the fossil fuel giant Exxon Mobil.The company announced that it would give $1 million over the next two years to Americans for Carbon Dividends, a group supporting legislation that would tax carbon emissions and return the money to Americans in refunds.Scott Silvestri, an Exxon spokesman, said, \u201cApplying a uniform cost across the economy is consistent with our principles on how to manage the risk of climate change.\u201dTed Halstead, another founder of Americans for Carbon Dividends, said he expected lawmakers in Washington to propose legislation based on the plan in the next session of Congress, with a long-term goal of passing legislation in 2021. \u201cWe see this as a marathon, not a sprint,\u201d he said.\u201cAt least Exxon money is now on both sides of the fight,\u201d he said.Having all those things delivered to our doorsteps is convenient, but is it bad for the environment?The thing to bear in mind is that delivery trucks cause pollution, congestion and noise in residential areas.And there are things you can do to make your online shopping a bit greener. First, buy in volume when you can. One big order, instead of several smaller ones, means fewer trucks on the road churning out carbon dioxide. Second, plan ahead and try to avoid express delivery. \u201cOne-day delivery is often free, but it comes at a high cost for the environment,\u201d Dr. Jaller said. That\u2019s because delivery companies need to make more trips when customers choose expedited shipping. Speaking of those trucks, try to be sure when you click the purchase button. More returns leads to more vehicles on the road. And, be sure to recycle the boxes and other packing material. Finally, if you shop online, try to avoid canceling out the benefits with still more shopping in brick-and-mortar shops. \u201cThe problem is that as well as buying online, we still go to the stores, to Safeway or Target or Whole Foods,\u201d Dr. Jaller said. \u201cWe still go in there, but also get a truck to deliver other products to our homes.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Billionaire Who Led Sears Into Bankruptcy Court", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFinancial engineers like Eddie Lampert are wreaking havoc on American companies.Mr. Cohan is a former investment banker and the author of four books about Wall Street.It\u2019s yet another cautionary tale about the limits of financial engineering. It didn\u2019t have to be this way. Mr. Lampert began this 15-year odyssey in 2003 after he bought the bonds of the failing discount retailer Kmart and converted those bonds into a controlling position in Kmart\u2019s equity. He ran his own hedge fund, ESL, investing money from wealthy billionaires such as David Geffen, the Ziff family and Michael Dell. Using their money, and some of his own, Mr. Lampert became a billionaire, too, with gargantuan successes investing in, among others, AutoZone, an auto parts retailer, and AutoNation, a car retailer. He saw opportunities where others did not, often won big, and became an investing legend.Mr. Lampert was wrong about that. He decided not to invest the capital needed to refurbish the Sears and Kmart stores to keep their inventory and appearance fresh. Instead, he made a huge gamble, one that never really paid off, to invest in Sears\u2019s website and online shopping. He was too early, and the Sears customer base never cottoned to shopping online. Instead, Amazon ate Sears\u2019s lunch (and breakfast and dinner) until he threw in the towel this year and joined forces with Amazon to allow it to sell Kenmore appliances, something that he long refused to do.Most others would have bailed years earlier. Not Mr. Lampert. It really was little more than an intellectual exercise. Could he figure out ways to save Sears and Kmart from bankruptcy, even though nearly everyone told him he could not? The answer, of course, was no. But that\u2019s not the end of the story. Since Mr. Lampert is Sears\u2019 largest single creditor, he is in a position to control the company again if and when it is able to emerge from bankruptcy protection. Mr. Lampert appears to be gearing up for that outcome. He\u2019s still the chairman of the Sears board of directors, although he gave up his role as chief executive as part of the bankruptcy filing. He\u2019s also proposed making a new secured $300 million loan to enable the company to continue operating in bankruptcy. And he\u2019d still like to buy the Kenmore brand, one of its most valuable properties, from Sears for $400 million. It will be up to a bankruptcy judge to decide.The question is, why would anyone give him that chance? Yes, many old-economy retailers have failed to adapt to consumers\u2019 changing needs. But the wizards of financial engineering \u2014 whether it\u2019s Mr. Lampert at Sears or the venerable buyout firm KKR at Toys \"R\" Us \u2014 have not done much better. The next time the Masters of the Universe come knocking with a buyout proposal, a smart company may want to lock the boardroom door.William D.

Unfortunately, some C.E.O.s still embrace this myopic view and believe that they have a duty to shareholders alone, with little or no responsibility to the communities in which they operate. I contend that business must have a purpose beyond profits, and that such purpose can, over time, benefit both stockholders and stakeholders.This is a humanitarian emergency and it demands an emergency response. San Francisco\u2019s epidemic of homelessness is solvable, but only if we devote the resources that are necessary.This would raise up to $300 million a year to address homelessness, roughly double what San Francisco spends now. Yes, we are a business that supports a tax on our business \u2014 because we are a part of our community and our community is in crisis.As our residents are forced onto the streets, many large companies \u2014 some of which have benefited from tax breaks given to them by the city \u2014 are also reaping a windfall from recent cuts to corporate taxes. It\u2019s absurd to believe that these businesses can\u2019t afford one half of 1 percent of gross receipts to help address the most important problem facing our community. Salesforce, for instance, is the city\u2019s largest private employer. Proposition C could increase our annual tax by about $10 million; we expect revenues this year of $13 billion. Even with Proposition C, we\u2019ll be just fine.This crisis reminds us that business does not exist in a bubble. Companies can truly thrive only when our communities succeed as well: when our public schools prepare our children for a digital economy; when people are treated equally, regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation or gender identity; when we protect our environment from pollution and climate change; when our residents are no longer forced out of their homes and onto the streets. In this sense, Proposition C is a referendum on the role of business in our communities and, by extension, our country. The business of business is no longer merely business. Our obligation is not just to increase profits for shareholders. We must also hold ourselves accountable to a broader set of stakeholders: to our customers, our employees, the environment and the communities in which we work and live.

She is more than happy to tell it, but the thing she really wants to talk about is the electric grid.\u201cThe foundation of all humanity, way back to the beginning, has been energy,\u201d she said, walking outside the Washington County Treatment Court, a drug-treatment program, on a brisk fall day. \u201cThe rise and fall of empires has been based on energy.\u201dBack then, she would retreat after school to the attic of her home in rural New York to relax, pick an outfit from her hidden stash of women\u2019s clothes and tinker beneath the eaves on homemade electrical circuits and other projects.\u201cI had my own little fortress, and it was cool.

But the government\u2019s announcement this week that it was banning asbestos, a potent cause of cancer, came decades after many other nations took the step.For more than a century, asbestos was a ubiquitous miracle fiber. Sprayed on the steel structure of buildings and inside ships, it suppressed fires. It was found in a type of home insulation and in roofing tiles, and was used to seal heating ducts. Asbestos was mixed with concrete to make pipes, woven into flameproof fabrics, and made into gaskets, building supplies and a variety of industrial goods. But inhaling even small quantities of its fibers could be deadly.Canada\u2019s ban comes 31 years after the World Health Organization first declared that asbestos causes cancer. Its harmful effects on workers\u2019 lungs were identified as early as the 1920s, and many countries began limiting its use in the 1970s.But Canada was once a major source of the world\u2019s asbestos, and actively fought efforts to limit its use. Despite widespread scientific evidence to the contrary, it continued to claim that the form found in Quebec, chrysotile asbestos, was not harmful. As recently as 2000, the Canadian government challenged a ban by France on the imports of chrysotile asbestos at the World Trade Organization. Four years later, Canada blocked efforts to formally declare asbestos a hazardous material under an international agreement.Asbestos kills in several ways. It can cause lung cancer, it can lead to mesothelioma, a fast-acting cancer that attacks major organs, and asbestosis, a cancer that hardens the lungs and ultimately suffocates its victims. In addition to miners, construction workers and shipyard workers were also widely affected. Even now it continues to be found in brake pads and brake linings of heavy trucks.\u201cThis is a huge milestone for Canada, despite the shortcomings,\u201d said Fe de Leon, a researcher with the Canadian Environmental Law Association who has long pushed for a ban. \u201cIt really sets the stage for shifting Canada\u2019s image around asbestos.\u201dCanada\u2019s new ban has some exceptions. Companies will still be allowed to process the mountains of tailings from Quebec\u2019s mines to extract magnesium, even though about 40 percent of those leftovers contain asbestos. And some highly specialized products containing asbestos, including fittings for nuclear power plants, will remain on the market. Ms. de Leon would like to see those phased out promptly.More broadly, she said, much work remains to ensure that the asbestos Canadians remove from schools, hospitals, offices, factories and houses is properly disposed of. Ms. de Leon, along with the Canadian Cancer Society, wants Canada to create a national registry of buildings containing asbestos \u2014 and an agency to deal with the deadly legacy.As readers of this newsletter who live in Canada know well, Wednesday was the first day of legal recreational marijuana sales in the country.

Amazon ended down nearly 8 percent and Alphabet, the parent company of the search giant Google, fell 1.8 percent after they reported quarterly results on Thursday evening. Their reports did little to calm jittery investors who have focused on quarterly corporate updates in search of clues to the economic outlook for 2019. Amazon\u2019s sales forecast for the coming holiday season fell short of investor hopes. And Alphabet\u2019s revenue fell short of analyst expectations. \u201cThe poor earnings are reflecting a slowdown in growth, not a disastrous slowdown, but enough to take stocks down,\u201d said Ilya Feygin, managing director at the institutional brokerage firm WallachBeth. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index, the broad measure of the United States stock market, tumbled throughout the morning, falling as much as 2.8 percent before clawing back some losses to finish down 1.7 percent. At one point, the early-day losses had the index down more than 10 percent below its recent peak on Sept. 20. By the close of trading Friday, the S.&.P. was down more 9 percent from that late-September high, and is now in negative territory for the year.In financial markets, a drop of 10 percent or more is typically referred to as a correction \u2014 a term that describes a market sell-off that is more serious than a garden-variety slump. Such stumbles are not uncommon: Earlier this year markets fell more than 10 percent in a violent sell-off that ended in early February. There was some indication on Friday that the sharp downturn in stocks had some investors reconsidering whether the Federal Reserve will go through with an interest rate hike at its next meeting in December. Analysis of interest rate futures suggested that there was less certainty about that rate hike than there had been even a few days ago, according to Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. interest rate strategy at BMO Capital Markets.Some pockets of the market sensitive to interest rates actually rallied, helping to cut losses. Shares of homebuilders, which have been hit hard this year rose more than 2 percent.Including this recent slide, six sell-offs have earned the correction designation since the current bull market for stocks began in March 2009. The nearly decade-long rise in stocks is one of the longest such runs on record. But given the length of the current bull market \u2014 in which stocks have risen nearly 300 percent \u2014 investors have been uneasy. \u201cThe question is: Is this the top of a bull market? And is the recession going to start?\u201d said Julian Emanuel, chief equity strategist at institutional brokerage BTIG. But those worries are not necessarily justified, Mr. Emanuel said.\u201cFrom our point of view, everything that we see tells us that a recession is not imminent,\u201d he said.Fresh economic data supports that view. Government numbers released on Friday showed that gross domestic product rose at a robust 3.5 percent annual pace during the third quarter. Third-quarter corporate profits \u2014 which public companies are currently releasing \u2014 are on pace to be up more than 20 percent. Even so, there are factors that have dampened investor enthusiasm, including rising interest rates, slowing growth in China \u2014 the world\u2019s second-largest economy \u2014 and cost increases tied to the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.On Friday, the waves of selling, and the odd bit of buying, churned through the markets in a volatile session. Alphabet\u2019s share price was down as much as 5.5 percent and up as much as 1 percent before settling lower by 1.8 percent. Investors continued to pound the share prices of companies that offered less optimistic outlooks for the coming year. Mohawk Industries, which makes carpet, hardwood flooring and vinyl tiling, plunged 23.9 percent after its earnings report on Friday fell short of expectations. The computer-drive maker Western Digital, which delivered disappointing results in its report after the market closed on Thursday, dove by 18 percent. Not all corporate results have depressed the market. The information technology services firm Roper Technologies rose 7.6 percent on a solid earnings report on Friday, making it the best performing stock in the S.&P. 500. But on the whole, the technology sector continued its recent slump, as large and small companies alike continued to slide. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index dropped 2.1 percent, pulled lower by Facebook, which fell 3.7 percent, and Apple, which declined 1.6 percent. Both companies are scheduled to report earnings next week. The Nasdaq is down nearly 11 percent this month, in a brutal reversal for the tech and software shares that had been a favorite for mutual funds, hedge funds and other institutional investors this year.\u201cWe think that institutional money kind of got crowded into those kinds of names,\u201d said Kevin Dennean, Americas I.T. sector strategist at UBS Global Wealth Management. \u201cFor whatever reason, you\u2019re seeing money come out of those high-growth software names.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Chinese Oil Company Official Talked Arms Deals and Evading Iran Sanctions, U.S. Says", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a filing on Tuesday in a federal court in New York, prosecutors said that the executive, a former Hong Kong city official and ophthalmologist named Patrick Ho, had discussed using the company\u2019s connections to help sell weapons to Chad, Qatar and Libya. The prosecutors also accused Mr. Ho of exploring whether CEFC could serve as a middleman for an Iranian company to gain access to funds from a Chinese bank under international sanctions.Edward Kim, a lawyer for Mr. Ho, declined to comment on Wednesday. CEFC did not respond to a request for comment. Federal prosecutors did not say whether any of these deals went through and did not press additional charges.But the allegations add a new dimension to what is currently known about CEFC. Virtually unknown just a year ago, it leapt onto the global stage when it said it would buy a $9 billion stake in Rosneft, the state-controlled Russian oil giant.But the company has since come under a cloud. Mr. Ye disappeared in China earlier this year. A state-owned Chinese conglomerate, Citic, has taken over many of its international assets. It is now one of a number of ambitious Chinese companies that have turned from a big buyer of global assets to a big seller, as Chinese leaders ratchet back on debt and financial risk in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.Mr. Ho has also denied the allegations.The new allegations focus on what federal prosecutors said was email correspondence between Mr. Ho and Cheikh Gadio, a former Senegalese foreign minister. Prosecutors have accused Mr. Ho of trying to bribe Mr. D\u00e9by by presenting him with $2 million in cash hidden in several gift boxes. Prosecutors agreed to drop charges against Mr. Gadio last month and signed a non-prosecution agreement with him. In return Mr. Gadio has agreed to testify at the trial about his knowledge of Mr. Ho\u2019s attempt to bribe the president of Chad, who prosecutors said had rejected the cash hidden in the boxes.On Thursday, a federal judge in Manhattan again denied a request for bail for Mr. Ho, who has been held in a federal detention center since his arrest. Mr. Ho\u2019s lawyers had argued that the case against him was weakened by the prosecution\u2019s decision to dismiss the charges against Mr. Gadio. But Judge Loretta A. Preska disagreed.\u201cThe government\u2019s case has been strengthened not weakened\u201d by Mr. Gadio\u2019s agreement to testify at the trial, she said.In excerpts from the emails submitted by prosecutors on Tuesday to bolster their claims about arms dealings, Mr. Gadio is said to have appealed to Mr. Ho to help Mr. D\u00e9by crush the Islamist group Boko Haram.\u201cDo you think CEFC can intervene with the Chinese state to get an urgent, extremely confidential and significant military weapon assistance to our friend who has engaged in the battle of his life against the devils of Boko Haram?\u201d Mr. Gadio wrote, referring to Mr. D\u00e9by.Mr. Ho responded to say he had received the \u201cimportant message\u201d and that it was being \u201cgiven the highest level of consideration.\u201dOn paper, Mr. Ho ran the nonprofit arm of CEFC and hosted forums about energy security and the \u201cBelt and Road Initiative\u201d campaign by President Xi Jinping to promote China\u2019s influence overseas. Many of these conferences drew big crowds and featured a senior Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army general and American officials.But according to the United States government, at the same time Mr. Ho was also laying the groundwork for bribes that involved both money and arms, sometimes writing in emails about the risks involved in such transactions.In March 2015, Mr. Ho received an email from a person offering to provide an inventory of arms, according to prosecutors. He told the individual to \u201cfind a way to pass them onto me and we can execute that right away,\u201d according to the email excerpts provided by prosecutors. It was a list of arms for Libya\u2019s military, according to federal prosecutors, who did not identify the person.A month later, according to prosecutors, Mr. Ho sent an email to another individual saying that Qatar \u201calso needs urgently a list of toys from us.\u201d In the same email, he said: \u201cFor the same reason we had for Libya, we cannot sell directly to them. Is there a way you could act as an intermediary in both cases?\u201dThe two corresponded back and forth about the trickiness of embargoes, according to prosecutors.Mr. Ho then replied, according to prosecutors: \u201cQatar needs new toys quite urgently. Their chief is coming to China and we hope to give them a piece of good news. Please confirm soonest.\u201dAt one point, according to prosecutors, Mr. Ho positioned CEFC as a potential front for illegal business transactions. In 2014, he discussed the possibility that CEFC could act as a go-between for an Iranian company looking to buy precious metals in Hong Kong using money that had been blocked in China, according to email excerpts provided by prosecutors. At the time, Iran was under international sanctions for accelerating its nuclear program.These details about Mr. Ho\u2019s alleged discussions come as the company is slowly being taken apart by the Chinese government in Mr. Ye\u2019s absence.Mr. Ye was 25 when he started the company, and well-known within China even before his disappearance. He became the public face of Chinese entrepreneurship and was both a corporate leader and a diplomatic envoy overseas, posing for photographs with world leaders like President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, and meeting with Henry Kissinger, the former secretary of state, and Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman.Mr. Ho\u2019s trial is set to begin on Nov. 5, but prosecutors and defense lawyers discussed with the judge on Thursday the possibility that a delay might be needed to deal with several outstanding issues.In an aside during the hearing, Judge Preska thanked Mr. Ho for providing counseling and advice to a criminal defendant in a drug case whom she had recently sentenced. Mr. Ho helped the defendant, Jonathan Weeks, study for his General Education Development certificate several hours a day for the past several months, according to a filing by Mr. Weeks\u2019s lawyer.Judge Preska said the counseling that Mr. Ho had given at the Metropolitan Correctional Center had helped the man.Mr. Ho, seated at the defense table, simply nodded.Alexandra Stevenson reported from Hong Kong and Matthew Goldstein from New York.Advertisement"}

I was one of them. The militarists are back. Mr. Veloso is a composer, singer, writer and political activist.RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 \u201cBrazil is not for beginners,\u201d Antonio Carlos Jobim used to say. Mr. Jobim, who wrote \u201cThe Girl From Ipanema,\u201d was one of Brazil\u2019s most important musicians, one whom we can thank for the fact that music lovers everywhere have to think twice before pigeonholing Brazilian pop as \u201cworld music.\u201dWhen I told an American friend about the maestro\u2019s line, he retorted, \u201cNo country is.\u201d My American friend had a point. In some ways, perhaps Brazil isn\u2019t so special.Recently, I\u2019ve found myself thinking about the 1980s. I was making records and playing to sold-out crowds, but I knew what needed to change in my country. Back then, we Brazilians were fighting for free elections after some 20 years of military dictatorship. If someone had told me then that some day we would elect to the presidency people like Fernando Henrique Cardoso and then Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, it would have sounded like wishful thinking. Then it happened. Mr. Cardoso\u2019s election in 1994 and then Mr. da Silva\u2019s in 2002 carried huge symbolic weight. They showed that we were a democracy, and they changed the shape of our society by helping millions escape poverty. Brazilian society gained more self-respect.But despite all the progress and the country\u2019s apparent maturity, Brazil, the fourth-largest democracy in the world, is far from solid. Dark forces, from within and from without, now seem to be forcing us backward and down.Many artists, musicians, filmmakers and thinkers saw themselves in an environment where reactionary ideologues, who \u2014 through books, websites and news articles \u2014 have been denigrating any attempt to overcome inequality by linking socially progressive policies to a Venezuelan-type of nightmare, generating fear that minorities\u2019 rights will erode religious and moral principles, or simply by indoctrinating people in brutality through the systematic use of derogatory language. The rise of Mr. Bolsonaro as a mythical figure fulfills the expectations created by that kind of intellectual attack. It\u2019s not an exchange of arguments: Those who don\u2019t believe in democracy work in insidious ways.As a public figure in Brazil, I have a duty to try to clarify these facts. I am an old man now, but I was young in the \u201960s and \u201970s, and I remember. So I have to speak out.In the late \u201960s, the military junta imprisoned and arrested many artists and intellectuals for their political beliefs. I was one of them, along with my friend and colleague Gilberto Gil.Gilberto and I spent a week each in a dirty cell. Then, with no explanation, we were transferred to another military prison for two months. After that, four months of house arrest until, finally, exile, where we stayed for two and a half years. Other students, writers and journalists were imprisoned in the cells where we were, but none was tortured. During the night, though, we could hear people\u2019s screams. They were either political prisoners who the military thought were linked to armed resistance groups or poor youngsters who were caught in thefts or drug selling. Those sounds have never left my mind.Many people here say they are planning to live abroad if the captain wins. I never wanted to live in any country other than Brazil. And I don\u2019t want to now. I was forced into exile once. It won\u2019t happen again. I want my music, my presence, to be a permanent resistance to whatever anti-democratic feature may come out of a probable Bolsonaro government.Caetano Veloso is a Brazilian composer, singer, writer and political activist.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "France Lifts the Lid on Its Algeria War", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore than half a century later, a French president has acknowledged his country\u2019s responsibility for the brutality of a colonial war. Ms. Kauffmann is the editorial director of Le Monde.PARIS \u2014 On June 11, 1957, at 11 p.m., French soldiers burst into Maurice Audin\u2019s apartment in Algiers. Mr. Audin, a 25-year-old mathematician, just had time to tell his wife, Josette, \u201cTake care of the children\u201d before being marched down the staircase by two paratroopers.Those were the last words she heard from him. Neither she nor their three children, then 3 years old, 18 months and 1 month, ever saw him again.For the next 61 years, Ms. Audin, helped by French intellectuals, fought to have the facts established about her husband, who was a member of the Algerian Communist Party and an antiwar activist. The French Army said he had escaped while being transferred. The truth was more sinister: In a 1958 book based on witness accounts, the historian Pierre Vidal-Naquet revealed that Mr. Audin was tortured by the military and died either as a result of his treatment or by summary execution.Thousands of Algerians similarly went missing during their war for independence from 1954 to 1962, and for six decades France had nothing to say about those disappearances. Finally, on Sept. 13, President Emmanuel Macron paid a visit to Josette Audin, now 87, at her home in Bagnolet, a Paris suburb, to seek forgiveness and tell her and her children, \u201cin the name of the French Republic,\u201d what they knew all along: that the official version was a lie and that Mr. Vidal-Naquet had been right \u2014 although the precise cause of Mr. Audin\u2019s death is still unknown.More remarkably, in a statement released the same day, Mr. Macron admitted what no French president before him had dared to acknowledge: that torture by French forces was widespread during the Algerian war as a product, in Mr. Macron\u2019s words, of a \u201clegally established system.\u201d French historians described this admission, which goes far beyond the emblematic Audin case, as a turning point for French history. President Macron also promised that archives that might shed light on the disappeared would be opened.Could official France finally be coming to terms with its colonial past? It certainly helps that Mr. Macron is the first French president born after the Algerian war. In every African country he visits he makes this point: As a 40-year-old, he does not feel burdened by this part of French history, and he encourages young Africans to look ahead, not back. It also took France more than half a century to acknowledge its complicity in deporting Jews during World War II; President Jacques Chirac did that in a 1995 speech at the site where Jews rounded up by the French police were detained before being sent to Nazi death camps. Previous presidents had supported the fiction that the Vichy regime, not France, bore responsibility for what Mr. Chirac called \u201cthe irreparable.\u201d Mr. Chirac, who was too young to have participated in World War II, had a clean conscience about the German occupation. But he did serve in Algeria as a junior officer, and as president avoided the Algerian war as an issue.Algeria has a special and painful place in French national memory, and vice versa. The Algerian war in the French psyche is often likened to the Vietnam War for Americans \u2014 two conscription wars that ended in humiliating defeat. But the Algerian wounds, kept under a lid, are deeper.More than a colony, Algeria had been made an integral part of France. For more than a century, hundreds of thousands of settlers left France for a new life across the Mediterranean. After the war, their descendants returned to a country many had never known, and they never quite accepted their loss. More than 1.5 million French conscripts fought in the war; 23,000 died, and those who came back traumatized kept silent. France\u2019s booming economy made the 1960s a time for optimism, not tales of failure. Amnesty laws ensured that army officers would not be held accountable for war crimes.Still, the two countries seem forever intertwined. Algiers and its spectacular bay still seem a mirror image of Marseille, on the other side of the sea. Algerian immigrants flocked to France for jobs in the 1960s and \u201970s, when labor was needed. Today, their children and grandchildren are French, but they have inherited a troubled legacy. The resentment never vanished. \u201cAs long as our common history is locked, we\u2019ll keep going in circles, as we\u2019ve done since 1962,\u201d a senior French diplomat told me two months ago. \u201cFrance must make some kind of gesture.\u201dWill President Macron\u2019s move unlock this tragic past? Algeria\u2019s minister of veteran affairs, Tayeb Zitouni, welcomed it as \u201ca positive, commendable step.\u201d But only a step. Mr. Macron\u2019s words about torture were cautious, and the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, France\u2019s presidential palace, noted that he was extending \u201crecognition,\u201d not \u201crepentance.\u201d A week later, the French president awarded the L\u00e9gion d\u2019Honneur to a group of Harkis, the 150,000 Algerians who chose to side with the French during the war and paid a heavy price for it. This is his point: the injustice to be repaired is on both sides. Florence Beaug\u00e9, a journalist who investigated the use of torture in the Algerian war, wishes that Mr. Macron had included in his statement, along with Mr. Audin, two other Algerians who suffered the same fate: Ali Boumendjel, a lawyer, and Larbi Ben M\u2019Hidi, a leader of the insurrection. \u201cThis would have been a huge step forward,\u201d Ms. Beaug\u00e9 said. Ms. Beaug\u00e9 opened the floodgates of memory in 2000 with an interview of Louisette Ighilahriz, an activist for Algerian independence who recounted being raped and tortured by French soldiers in 1957 while generals looked on. She spoke out after all those years to thank the army doctor who found her after an interrogation session and saved her life. The publication of the interview, on Le Monde\u2019s front page, was such a shock that shortly afterward, two retired generals agreed to speak out. They admitted overseeing the use of torture, giving new impetus to a debate that refused to go away. \u201cIt was not so much remorse as a need to talk,\u201d Ms. Beaug\u00e9 says. \u201cThey had to unload their dark past before leaving this world.\u201d Many of these actors are now gone, as is former President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, who in 1957 was justice minister in the Socialist government that gave the French Army a green light to crush the insurrection at all costs. As the official truth finally moves ahead, soul-searching can be expected about the political responsibilities of both Socialists and Gaullists, and of the highest echelons of the French armed forces. Light will have to be shed on the extent to which rape was used as a weapon, along with torture. The present Algerian leadership, heir to the independence war, will also have to finally confront the dark side of the insurgency\u2019s struggle.The introspection won\u2019t be easy, but it is now, at last, inevitable.Sylvie Kauffmann is the editorial director and a former editor in chief of Le Monde, and a contributing opinion writer.A caption for a picture that once accompanied this article misidentified the men marching in Algiers in 1957.

{"Headline": "What the Left Misses About Nationalism", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe perception of a common national identity is essential to democracies and to the modern welfare state. Mr. Judis is the author of \u201cThe Nationalist Revival: Trade, Immigration, and the Revolt Against Globalization.\u201d In Mr. Trump\u2019s version of nationalism, Muslims and Mexican-Americans are stigmatized, and African-American football players who protest racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem are denounced. Some of his applications of \u201cAmerica first\u201d \u2014 repudiating the Paris climate agreement or abandoning the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 may not even prove to be in the national interest. But these failings should not lead you to dismiss the value of nationalism, which, by itself, is neither good nor evil, liberal nor conservative. The perception of a common national identity is essential to democracies and to the modern welfare state, which depends on the willingness of citizens to pay taxes to aid fellow citizens whom they may never have set eyes upon. Today\u2019s nationalist revival is in reaction to the failure of global, not nation-based, initiatives that sailed over the heads of ordinary citizens. The reaction has been most potent on the political right, but there is certainly a basis for a liberal or social-democratic nationalism. If anything, the decline of liberal and social-democratic parties is a result at least in part of their inability to distinguish what is legitimate and justifiable in nationalism from what is small-minded, bigoted and contrary to the national interest it claims to uphold.The bold supranational initiatives of globalization \u2014\u00a0a system of floating exchange rates in relation to the dollar; the unrestricted flow of capital; free trade (with few tariffs and government subsidies) monitored by the new World Trade Organization; the expansion of NATO and the European Union to ensure that former Communist states became liberal capitalist democracies \u2014\u00a0have unquestionably done some good. They helped expand trade and benefited immigrants who fled from less to more developed nations.But in the United States and Western Europe, none of these initiatives really delivered as promised. The global economy has suffered a succession of financial crises culminating in the Great Recession and continuing to this day in Turkey and Argentina. The free movement of companies has led to a global race to the bottom for wages, taxes and regulation and to growing inequality within nations. Instead of producing convergence between the richer export-driven economies of Northern Europe and the less developed countries of Southern Europe, the euro has widened the gap between them.The rush of immigrants in the United States has brought about a clash of culture just as it had in past centuries. Employers have also used low-skilled immigrants to undercut unions and to turn mid-wage jobs in construction, meatpacking and janitorial services into low-wage labor. After Sept. 11, 2001, the resentment toward immigrants became fused with a rising fear in the United States and especially in Europe of Islamist terrorism. That created a huge political backlash against immigrants and refugees.Put that backlash together with the anger bred by lost manufacturing jobs and declining social services from reduced tax revenues, and you have the political base for Mr. Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, Brexit and Italy\u2019s League party.In the United States, Mr. Trump\u2019s nationalist policies have not been without merit. Where his predecessors have feared alienating China, he has boldly challenged its transfer of technology, cybertheft and hidden trade subsidies and barriers. He has also spoken up for American manufacturing industries and their workers, and chided footloose companies like Nabisco, Ford and Carrier.His Hobbesian take-no-prisoners approach to trade and foreign policy \u2014 sowing conflict with allies as well as rivals and foes \u2014 will threaten the underpinnings of global peace and prosperity, which still depends on a grudging acceptance of American economic and military power. There are already foreshadowings of future financial disorder \u2014 in discussions by the European Union, Russia and China to defy American sanctions against Iran by creating a new funding authority that would evade the dollar and by Russia and China\u2019s decision to use their own currencies rather than the dollar as the medium of exchange. Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration initiatives, too, have merely reinforced cultural resentments and done little to stem the oversupply of unskilled and easy-to-exploit unauthorized immigrants.In all of these areas, Mr. Trump has harmed, not strengthened, our nation. Yet in the United States, the liberal opposition has generally failed to acknowledge what is valid in the today\u2019s nationalist backlash. Many liberal pundits and political scientists continue to echo Hillary Clinton in characterizing Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters in 2016 as deplorables. They denounce Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs without proposing any plausible means of counterbalancing the huge surpluses from China and Germany. They dismiss as a lost cause the attempt to revive the towns of the Midwest and South by reviving manufacturing. They rightly insist that the United States find a way to integrate and assimilate the country\u2019s 12 million or more unauthorized immigrants, but they ignore the continuing flood of people without papers crossing the border or overstaying their visas and they dismiss attempts to change national priorities toward skilled immigrants. Here is the simple truth: As long as corporations are free to roam the globe in search of lower wages and taxes, and as long as the United States opens its borders to millions of unskilled immigrants, liberals will not be able to create bountiful, equitable societies, where people are free from basic anxieties about obtaining health care, education and housing. In Europe, social democrats face very similar challenges with immigration, refugees and euro-imposed austerity. To achieve their historic objectives, liberals and social democrats will have to respond constructively to, rather than dismiss, the nationalist reaction to globalization. Advertisement"}

He turned decisively to assemblage after the Watts rebellion of 1965, making use of debris from the riots; later he stepped back from art for a decade and worked for a California state agency and continued working with found materials in Joshua Tree, where he moved in 1989 and made nearly all the works in this show.Some of the wall-mounted works here consist almost wholly of found objects. Two assemblages from 1989 called \u201cRags and Old Iron (After Nina Simone),\u201d bristling yet carefully balanced, graft together a tennis racket, frayed scraps of fabric, dangling beads and a pitchfork. Their part-by-part construction takes inspiration as freely from central African sculpture traditions as from Dada, as much from the history of jazz as the Nouveau R\u00e9alisme of Jean Tinguely and Arman. Other assemblages here have more finely worked wooden pieces. In \u201cBlack, Brown and Beige (After Duke Ellington)\u201d (1989), combs and spindles and scraps of wicker nestle in round-edge wood cartouches that recall a disassembled piano.Spend some time looking closely at \u201cAccess\u201d (1993). It\u2019s loaded, nearly overloaded, with a pair of faucets, busted hubcaps, worn sandals and the business end of a spade, that last being one of several elements with a racial overtone. It is so jam-packed it seems it could topple. Keeping it together, making it endure, was the effort of a lifetime\u2019s work in which art and advocacy were one and history was a junkyard ripe for gleaning. JASON FARAGO\u201cRevolution is in the air,\u201d wrote the Danish composer and artist Henning Christiansen (1932-2008) in a 1969 essay addressed to the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, reprinted in a catalog viewable in his show, \u201cFreedom Is Around the Corner,\u201d at Blank Forms. \u201cThe vibrations of the youth revolution,\u201d he wrote, \u201chave spread into debate on art, literature and music, with a massive politicization of attitudes as a result.\u201d Mr. Christiansen, who was associated with the \u201960s Fluxus movement, channeled that sense of revolution into experimental music made with axes and sledgehammers, as well as radical scores, sculptures, collages and films.You can see and hear all of these in this rich and quirky sampling from more than 50 years of his oeuvre. An illuminated green plastic sculpture with a pitched roof stands in the center of the space. The words \u201cPoetical Economy\u201d are painted on its side, proposing Mr. Christiansen\u2019s preferred form of exchange. Sock sculptures on the wall resemble ecstatic figures; painted shoes strung with bells repurpose mundane objects. A black-and-white film featuring shirtless men slathered with mud suggests a return to some primal state.A grid of album covers near the entrance attests to Mr. Christiansen\u2019s commitment to altering the landscape of sound and experimental music, shifting performance away from what he called the \u201cusual shut-up-and-listen concert.\u201d A poster for a 1985 show at the zoo in Rome exemplifies his expanded approach and audience. After all, the revolution needs to be both inward and outward, he wrote to Stockhausen, with human beings becoming more \u201caccommodating and flexible and less authoritarian, and you must of course also demand that their societies do the same.\u201d MARTHA SCHWENDENERIn White\u2019s sepia-toned, oil and graphite drawing of the singer and activist Paul Robeson, from 1973, the subject\u2019s head is placed in the bottom third of a circular panel. Though Robeson looks up into a cloud of dark brush strokes, the way he\u2019s lit \u2014 with highlights on cheeks, nose and forehead \u2014 suggests that the cloud itself is a source of light. A charged use of monochrome is even more striking in \u201cLet the Light Enter,\u201d a tall and narrow 1961 portrait of a young woman that hangs next to a stunning mixed-media painting by Kerry James Marshall, who studied with White.White\u2019s overall composition is so dark that the unlit side of the woman\u2019s body isn\u2019t so much shadowed as erased. But his modeling and modulating hues are so subtle that, despite this annihilating weight of color, she remains unmistakable. The flatter and more uniform black of the female nude in Mr. Marshall\u2019s \u201cYou Must Suffer if You Want to be Beautiful,\u201d by contrast, pushes the color\u2019s political subtext right to the front.\u201cI Been Rebuked & I Been Scorned (Solid as a Rock),\u201d from 1954, shows an older woman with an upward-tilted gaze resting two enormous fists in her lap. The density of White\u2019s charcoal mark gives the figure an indubitable physical presence, while its softness gives that presence a spiritual quality. The formal similarity of skin, shadow and background means that all three share an implication of unknown depths, which is what gives the portrait its distinctive humanity.

{"Headline": "For Japan, N.B.A. 101 Is Now in Session", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTOKYO \u2014 Pete Pranica, the longtime television voice of the Memphis Grizzlies, appeared to be square dancing as he stood in a small conference room here, demonstrating for Japanese broadcasters the N.B.A. violation of thrusting out a hip while setting a screen.Viewers, he told his fellow commentators through an interpreter, expect \u201cthat you know all there is to know about the N.B.A.\u201dFor two days in late September, using a dry-erase board, video and a Power Point presentation, Pranica patiently and deftly explained everything from rules changes to team-by-team outlooks to preparing to broadcast a game. His attire \u2014 a Grizzlies polo shirt and khakis \u2014 was casual, but his message was not.The N.B.A. has had a presence in Japan, the world\u2019s third-largest economy, for three decades and has played 12 regular-season games here since 1990. Yet, some of the broadcasters attending Pranica\u2019s workshop had little experience calling league games, having spent much of their careers covering baseball and soccer or high school basketball.Was it true, Pranica was asked, that the collective jersey numbers of the three referees at each N.B.A. game must not exceed 100?\u201cNot that I\u2019m aware of,\u201d he said diplomatically.Hence, the urgency of Pranica\u2019s seminar.In Japan, the N.B.A. is not viewed with the same fervor or depth of knowledge as in other Asian countries like the Philippines, where basketball is the No. 1 participation sport. In China, the top N.B.A. market outside the United States, an estimated 300 million people play the sport and 640 million cumulative viewers watched league programming last season.\u201cThe Philippines is a beacon for us when we think about the kind of popularity we\u2019d love to see in markets like Japan,\u201d Matt Brabants, the N.B.A.\u2019s senior vice president for global media distribution and business operations, said in a telephone interview. \u201cAnd we have to work at that.\u201dSeparately, Rakuten became a jersey sponsor of the Golden State Warriors for a reported $60 million over three seasons. The company name appears on the team\u2019s jerseys and practice facility.Rakuten represents the N.B.A.\u2019s most inclusive media partnership ever in Japan. But while a number of Japanese baseball and soccer players have enjoyed prominent international careers, only one Japanese-born player has ever played in the N.B.A.In recent years, the management of professional basketball in Japan has been in turmoil. The Japan Basketball Association was suspended in 2014 by FIBA for operating two competing professional leagues.The matter was resolved, and the Japanese basketball federation was reinstated in 2015. The two pro leagues merged into what is now a three-tiered league called the B.League, which began play during the 2016-17 season and features relegation and promotion like a professional soccer league.Yet, the rules and tactics of basketball are not as widely understood in Japan as in the Philippines and China, said J.R. Henderson, a Californian who played on U.C.L.A.\u2019s 1995 N.C.A.A. championship team and has played professionally in Japan since 2001.\u201cIt\u2019s not about the N.B.A.; it\u2019s about basketball,\u201d Henderson said in a telephone interview. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the rules or substitution patterns, why timeouts are called at certain times in a game, how come sometimes the game is fast and why sometimes you slow it down.\u201dHenderson, now 41, played 30 games for the then Vancouver Grizzlies during the 1998-99 N.B.A. season and has become a naturalized Japanese citizen known here as J.R. Sakuragi.He plays for the Aisin Seahorses of the Japan league\u2019s top division. His teammates have an intimate knowledge of the N.B.A. and try to mimic its stars, Henderson said. Within his team, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s no different than fans in the States.\u201dOutside of his basketball circle, though, Henderson said, \u201cYou would have a hard time finding someone who knows who Carmelo Anthony is.\u201dBut opportunities are growing for Japan to become more familiar with the N.B.A.\u2019s players. The Rakuten deal is giving the league broader exposure. A basketball magazine called Dabudori (Double Dribble) has been available for the last year. And dozens of N.B.A. stars are expected to participate in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.Yuta Watanabe, a rookie 6-foot-9 forward from Japan who played at George Washington, has signed a two-way contract with the Memphis Grizzlies for the 2018-19 season, permitting him limited transfers from the team\u2019s G League, or developmental teams.Rui Hachimura, a 6-8 forward who could be Japan\u2019s top basketball prospect ever, is entering his junior season at Gonzaga. He is a mainstay on Japan\u2019s national team and, according to Gonzaga, only the fifth Japanese-born men\u2019s player to participate in Division I basketball.A Japanese player who could succeed in the N.B.A. \u201cfor more than a couple of games, say two or three years, would make a huge difference,\u201d Henderson said.Another difference could come from the way fans watch games. In the recent Summer League, the N.B.A. experimented with a broadcast format called vertical view. It was spurred, in part, Pranica said, by the preference of Chinese fans to watch their cellphones in the upright or portrait position, instead of the sideways or landscape position, during crowded morning rail commutes, when live games are typically broadcast there from the United States. Presumably, Japanese fans would have similar interest in the vertical view format.The N.B.A. is now available in 215 countries in 50 languages. In the Philippines, N.B.A. officials said, the most sophisticated fans prefer English-language broadcasts by former coaches and players like Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson.\u201cThey have good input, and they\u2019re funny,\u201d Riel Cruz, a restaurateur from the Philippines, said while returning home on a flight through Tokyo after vacationing in the United States. \u201cThe Filipino guys, some of what they say is nonsense. They talk about what they had for breakfast.\u201dFans in Japan mostly prefer games described in their native tongue, with additional context beyond the shorthand of an American broadcast, N.B.A. officials said. The language of basketball here is mostly formal, without extravagant catchphrases, and many words are similar to their English counterparts. A dunk, for instance, is called a dunku.But there is also a marvelous economy to some of the basketball lingo. A flagrant or unsportsmanlike foul is simply called an \u201cunspo.\u201d And a basketball shoe is a \u201cbasshu.\u201dReo Onishi, who interpreted for Pranica at the workshop and writes for NBA.com Japan, said he hoped the voice of the Grizzlies might inspire Japanese commentators to spice up their own broadcasts.Referring to Pranica\u2019s signature call when Memphis builds an insurmountable lead, Onishi laughed and said, \u201cEvery Japanese broadcaster will now be saying: \u2018Hammer, nail, coffin. This baby is over.\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Markets Just Dived. Democrats Shouldn\u2019t Get Too Excited.", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseUntil markets plunged on Wednesday, the economic news couldn\u2019t have been much better for Republicans heading into the midterm elections. Two weeks ago the Dow Jones industrial average hit a record. Last week the unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent. Economic growth estimates were just upgraded to 4.2 percent for the second quarter.President Trump hasn\u2019t been shy about taking credit: \u201cAs large as we are, we\u2019re the fastest-growing economy in the world, up $10 trillion,\u201d he told the United Nations in late September, grossly exaggerating both the order and magnitude of the gains. (The United States is nowhere near the fastest-growing economy in the world, and last year it grew by $1.3 trillion, not $10 trillion.)As the White House adviser Larry Kudlow recently put it, \u201cThe single biggest story this year is an economic boom that is durable and lasting.\u201dThe problem for Republicans: If history is any guide, neither record stock prices nor a booming economy will stem the incumbent party\u2019s losses in a congressional election.Keith Parker, chief equity strategist at UBS, recently completed an in-depth study of all midterm-election years from 1950 to 2014. \u201cIn nearly all instances the party of a sitting president loses seats,\u201d he concluded. \u201cWe sliced the data every way possible. A strong market going into the election doesn\u2019t necessarily help the incumbent\u2019s party.\u201d Nor does a bad stock market seem to hurt it.The same was true for the health of the economy: It had no discernible impact on the political outcome.Consider 2006, the middle of President George W. Bush\u2019s second term. Heading into the congressional elections that year, the stock market was up 11 percent. The economy grew that year at a 2.7 percent clip.Yet Democrats achieved a sweeping victory, gaining a majority in the House (which made Nancy Pelosi the first female speaker) and control of the Senate (where Bernie Sanders and Joe Lieberman joined 49 Democratic senators for an effective Democratic majority).Polls that year suggested that voter frustration over the Iraq war, Mr. Bush\u2019s proposal to privatize Social Security and the Republican-controlled Congress\u2019s scant achievements outweighed the positive economic backdrop.Many investors feared that the loss of Republican majorities would hurt financial markets. But the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended 2006 with an impressive gain of nearly 16 percent.In 2010, during President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, the economy was growing at a respectable 2.5 percent rate, and the stock market was up nearly 7 percent.Yet Democrats suffered widespread midterm losses. Republicans captured 63 seats in the House, regaining the majority, and gained six seats in the Senate. With the Tea Party wing of the Republican Party whipping up resentment about Wall Street bailouts and high unemployment, Democrats weren\u2019t able to capitalize on either rising stock prices or the economy\u2019s return to growth.Neither do plunging stock prices seem to have much impact on the electorate. In 2002, when the bursting technology bubble caused the S. & P. 500 to drop 22 percent, the president\u2019s party \u2014 in this case the Republicans during Mr. Bush\u2019s first term \u2014 gained seats in the House and Senate.Heading into the 1966 midterms, with Lyndon B. Johnson in the White House, stocks were in a bear market, having fallen 22 percent that year from peak to trough.Yet, the incumbent Democrats fared relatively well, losing only three seats in the Senate and 46 seats in the House and maintaining control of both chambers.The good news for investors is that just as stock prices and the economy appear to have little impact on midterm results, the converse is also true: The outcome of congressional elections has little or no impact on stock prices and the economy. \u201cWhatever the momentum there is going into the elections tends to continue,\u201d Mr. Parker said. \u201cPolitics don\u2019t seem to have much impact.\u201dHe found that, on average, stocks gained 14.5 percent from the end of August to the end of March in the year after midterm elections. That compares with average gains of 6.1 percent over the same period in non-midterm years.Of the 17 midterm election periods Mr. Parker analyzed, only two \u2014 1978 and 2002 \u2014 were followed by market drops.There have been six midterms where one or both houses of Congress experienced a change in control. That had no impact on stocks: The average gains in those years were the same as in years when there was no change in control.The reason stocks do so well around midterm elections, Mr. Parker theorized, is that valuations before the elections tend to be lower than fair value, perhaps because investors are overly concerned about the risk of political change. (That doesn\u2019t appear to have been much of a factor in this week\u2019s drop, which was fueled in large part by concerns about rising interest rates and a trade war with China.)Mr. Parker\u2019s reasoning suggests that any pre-election weakness is a buying opportunity.Mr. Parker cautioned that the period he studied provides too few midterm elections, and thus too little data, to draw any firm conclusions. Still, the market\u2019s outsize gains around midterms are \u201ca significant statistical anomaly,\u201d he said.This year, the S. & P. 500 is down more than 5 percent since the end of August. That means there will have to be a big rally by next spring if Mr. Parker\u2019s pattern is to continue.An earlier version of this column misstated the period of time the chief equity strategist at UBS studied in a review of American midterm elections. The strategist looked at all midterms from 1950 to 2014, not since 1938.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cesar Sayoc\u2019s Path on Social Media: From Food Photos to Partisan Fury", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUntil 2016, Cesar Altieri Sayoc Jr.\u2019s life on social media looked unremarkable. On his Facebook page, he posted photos of decadent meals, gym workouts, scantily clad women and sports games \u2014 the stereotypical trappings of middle-age masculinity.But that year, Mr. Sayoc\u2019s social media presence took on a darker and more partisan tone. He opened a new Twitter account and began posting links to sensational right-wing news stories, adding captions like \u201cClinton busted exposed rigging entire election.\u201d On Facebook, his anodyne posts gave way to a feed overflowing with pro-Donald Trump images, news stories about Muslims and the Islamic State, far-fetched conspiracy theories and clips from Fox News broadcasts.\u201cHe went from posting pictures of women, real estate, dining and cars to posting pictures of ISIS, guns and people in jail,\u201d said Jonathan Albright, the research director for Columbia University\u2019s Tow Center for Digital Journalism. \u201cIt\u2019s a remarkable change.\u201dTwitter was warned at least once about Mr. Sayoc\u2019s threatening behavior, but failed to act. On Friday, the company took down Mr. Sayoc\u2019s accounts after he was named as a suspect.Facebook, which also took down his account on Friday, condemned his actions in a statement. \u201cThere is absolutely no place on our platforms for people who attempt such horrendous acts.\u201dBut before Mr. Sayoc\u2019s accounts were taken down, The New York Times archived their contents. And a closer study of his online activity reveals the evolution of a political identity built on a foundation of false news and misinformation, and steeped in the insular culture of the right-wing media. For years, these platforms captured Mr. Sayoc\u2019s attention with a steady flow of outrage and hyperpartisan clickbait and gave him a public venue to declare his allegiance to Mr. Trump and his antipathy for the president\u2019s enemies.On social media, none of this behavior is particularly out of the ordinary. In fact, to many of his followers, Mr. Sayoc may have appeared to be just one of many partisan keyboard warriors working through their rage.\u201cThere are tons of people like this,\u201d said Shannon McGregor, an assistant professor of communication at the University of Utah who studies social media. \u201cHe took these memes to their most violent extreme, but this is a pretty big world on social media.\u201dThe genesis of Mr. Sayoc\u2019s partisan awakening may never be known, but hints of it first appeared on his Facebook feed in early 2016, as the primary season for the presidential election was starting.That February, he posted a link to a conspiracy theory video on YouTube titled, \u201cIs Barack Obama THE ANTICHRIST \u2014 100% PROOF Is There!\u201d Days later, he posted a second YouTube video, \u201cSatan Sent Obama to Destroy America,\u201d and a clip featuring Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, which was called, \u201cMUST HEAR: Sean Exposes Illegal Immigrant Crime Stats.\u201d He posted several anti-Obama videos multiple times on his feed, interspersed with stories about personal finance and his favorite soccer players.By the summer, Mr. Sayoc\u2019s social media activity was all politics, all the time.On Facebook, he posted stories from Infowars, World Net Daily, Breitbart and other right-wing websites. His posts, which rarely included commentary apart from the links, showed a fascination with Islamist terrorism, illegal immigration and anti-Clinton conspiracy theories. (On one post, a YouTube link, he wrote: \u201cThe Clinton have funneled two billion dollars through Clinton foundation.\u201d)In October, a month before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, Mr. Sayoc posted a series of photos of himself at a Trump campaign rally, watching from the crowd in a red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat.Despite his prolific posting, Mr. Sayoc does not appear to have gained a wide audience. His Twitter account was followed by fewer than 1,200 people as of Friday morning, and although he had nearly 3,000 friends on Facebook, many of his posts were never commented on or shared.He did, however, display an unusual tendency to post stories and images over and over again, sometimes dozens of times.But while Mr. Sayoc may have been an outlier in frequency, the content he posted resembled the kind of highly charged outrage bait that is a staple of partisan internet circles. On social platforms, where polarized content is often better at generating engagement than nuanced conversations, there can be a temptation to veer into more extreme territory to stand out.\u201cPeople find people with similar interests, and it naturally leads them to encounters and relationships and information they wouldn\u2019t necessarily find offline,\u201d Mr. Albright said. \u201cBeing able to find similar communities can really lead you down a path of radicalization.\u201dFor years, many of Mr. Sayoc\u2019s posts simply reshared existing images, links and videos. But in recent months, he began to create more of his own posts. He began posting less on Facebook and dialed up his efforts on Twitter, where he could engage directly with his political heroes and foes.In March, he cheered on Republican tax policies, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t have pay taxes on bonus yea Trump Trump Trump.\u201dIn June, he tweeted a birthday card to Mr. Trump and wrote: \u201cHappy Birthday to greatest gift from God President Trump Trump Trump. The greatest result President ever and economy for all American Soaring 2016-2024 Trump Trump Trump.\u201dAnd on Twitter, he began to attack prominent liberals, especially those who had either criticized or been criticized by Mr. Trump.He called Lena Dunham, the outspoken creator of \u201cGirls\u201d on HBO, \u201cHollywood slime\u201d and told her to \u201cstick your show where sun doesn\u2019t shine.\u201dHe became obsessed with David Hogg, a student who survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Florida and had become a prominent advocate for gun control. He tweeted out dozens of photos of Mr. Hogg, accusing him of being a \u201cfake fraud\u201d and being paid by the billionaire George Soros, a benefactor of liberal causes and a frequent target of the right.In recent months, Mr. Sayoc\u2019s behavior changed. His posts took on a darker, more obsessive tone, often accompanied by threats of violence and gory images of bloody animal carcasses. No longer mistakable as an everyday internet partisan, he posted repeatedly about \u201cunconquered Seminoles,\u201d a reference to the tribe that he appears to have adopted. (It also appeared on his van.) And on Twitter, his messages turned dark and sinister.He directed a tweet at Ms. Waters, the California Democrat, with a photo of what appeared to be her house. The message read: \u201csee you soon.\u201dHe sent another to Eric H. Holder Jr., an attorney general under Mr. Obama, that read, \u201cSee u soon Tick Tock.\u201d And he told Zephyr Teachout, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for attorney general in New York, that he had a surprise waiting for her. \u201cWe Unconquered Seminole Tribe have a special Air boat tour lined up for you here in our Swamp Everglades,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSee u real soon. Hug your loved ones.\u201d\u201cWe are deeply sorry for that error,\u201d Twitter added.Mr. Sayoc continued to post unabated until as recently as Wednesday, even as the authorities were conducting a manhunt for the sender of the explosives that had been mailed to prominent Democrats. He sent a tweet to the Twitter account at the website TMZ that criticized Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate for governor in Florida, for raising campaign funds from Mr. Soros and other liberal donors.\u201c$500,000 Soros puppet,\u201d read the text over the image.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Visit to Pittsburgh Divides a City Mourning Victims of Hate", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPITTSBURGH \u2014 One of Pittsburgh\u2019s most solemn days began with hundreds coming together in anguish and grief in synagogues and at gravesides, to start the services for those killed as they prayed on the Sabbath. In the afternoon, they came together again, in shivas to honor the dead and comfort the living, and, later by the thousands, in solemn marches of protest around the Squirrel Hill neighborhood where the attack took place on Saturday.This is the Pittsburgh that met President Trump, who arrived with members of his family on Tuesday.The presidential visit, welcomed by some in Pittsburgh, unwanted or vigorously opposed by many others, began with a motorcade into the city and a visit to the Tree of Life synagogue. Mr. Trump lit memorial candles in a vestibule near where the shooting unfolded, and placed stones and white roses from the White House outside, in commemoration of those killed in an attack by a gunman full of anti-Semitic rage shouting that Jews must die.But if Mr. Trump\u2019s visit was intended to bring healing, it instead laid bare the nation\u2019s deep divisions. Many protesters in Pittsburgh had no doubt of what one called \u201cthe dotted line\u201d between presidential rhetoric and violence, though some people in the city have pushed back on the idea that Mr. Trump had fomented the atmosphere of anger. As the president moved around Pittsburgh, a largely Democratic city, the signs of discord were apparent.The protesters, some praying in Hebrew, others singing and chanting, moved around Squirrel Hill. Hoodie-wearing college students and Orthodox Jews with black hats and long beards walked alongside demonstrators carrying militant signs and middle-aged parents pushing strollers. Signs read \u201cWords matter\u201d and \u201cPresident Hate is not welcome in our state.\u201d As if to hold up a beloved local figure in contrast to the president, the largest march began on Beechwood Boulevard, where Mr. Rogers, the children\u2019s television figure, used to live, and it ended at the Presbyterian church where he used to pray.The mayor of Pittsburgh, Bill Peduto, who just a day before had urged the president not to visit while the mourners buried the dead, neither met with Mr. Trump nor joined the protests. The top four Republican and Democratic congressional leaders who were invited to join him all declined.At the synagogue, Mr. Trump was accompanied by the first lady, Melania Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law Jared Kushner. They were greeted by Rabbi Jeffrey Myers, the spiritual leader of the Tree of Life congregation, who spoke to the president on the history of the synagogue and the carnage there on Saturday as they lit 11 candles to honor the dead.Later, Mr. Trump spent about 90 minutes visiting the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. He met privately with four officers who were injured responding to the shooting, and then sat for about an hour with Peg Gottfried, the widow of Richard Gottfried, one of those killed on Saturday.Throughout the president\u2019s visit, protesters amassed by the thousands.\u201cWhile our community is still processing this violence from a few days ago, we recognize that it did not happen in a vacuum,\u201d said Ardon Shorr, who helped organize one protest not far from the Jewish Community Center, where the funeral for one of the victims of the attack was held just a few hours earlier. \u201cThese Jews were targeted specifically because they were helping refugees,\u201d he said, calling the visit, as funerals were taking place, \u201cinsulting\u201d to the victims and their families.Sherri Suppa, 54, who teaches special education students, held a picture of Mr. Rogers, who made Squirrel Hill his home, and the message \u201cLove Your Neighbor.\u201d Feeling helpless after the attack, she saw the march as a way to show support. She was also adamant that the president did not belong in Pittsburgh on this day. \u201cHis coming here is not an empathetic move, it\u2019s a power move,\u201d Ms. Suppa said. \u201cIt\u2019s the last thing the community needs.\u201dNot everyone in Pittsburgh was opposed to the visit. Even some of those who do not like Mr. Trump at all said he had no good choice, facing criticism if he came and criticism if he did not.An open letter to the president signed by more than 40 \u201cmembers of the Pittsburgh Jewish Community\u201d welcomed the president and expressed \u201cgratitude to you and your administration for your unwavering support of Israel.\u201d\u201cHow dare they blame Trump for this,\u201d said Tova Weinberg, a registered Democrat and Orthodox Jew who voted for Mr. Trump. \u201cWe love what he\u2019s doing for Israel, we love what he\u2019s doing for the economy. I\u2019m just crazy about him.\u201dDominick Candelore, the co-owner of a Cold Stone Creamery ice cream shop at the heart of Squirrel Hill, disagreed with some Jewish leaders who opposed a presidential visit.\u201cTo me, I welcome him, I welcome him with open arms,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have to agree with all his views, but it\u2019s a stand-up thing for him to do.\u201dDissent over the president\u2019s visit extended even to the grieving. The family of Daniel Stein, a victim of the attack who was buried on Tuesday, explicitly told inquiring federal officials that they did not want to meet with the president. They cited Mr. Trump\u2019s comments immediately after the shooting that the Tree of Life should have had an armed guard.\u201cIt was just a worthless thing to say,\u201d said Steven Halle, Mr. Stein\u2019s nephew. \u201cWhen something tragic has happened, you don\u2019t kick people when they are down. There should have been an apology.\u201dMr. Stein\u2019s was one of three funeral services in the city on Tuesday. Only one of them was open to all, the service for the Rosenthal brothers, David, 54, and Cecil, 59, described at the service by Rabbi Myers as \u201ctwo of the sweetest human beings you could ever meet.\u201dAn hour and a half before visitation began, the lines started forming at Rodef Shalom Temple, a stately, domed 111-year-old building that is home to one of the oldest Jewish congregations in western Pennsylvania. The crowd, which filled the large sanctuary to standing room, was racially diverse, made up of those stooped with age and crying infants, Jewish people \u2014 Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and nonobservant \u2014 and non-Jews, Pittsburgh natives and those who had flown in from elsewhere.It seemed as if all of Pittsburgh was there. The mayor came, as did Scott Brady, the United States attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania, who will be prosecuting the man charged with killing the Rosenthal brothers.A hundred-strong delegation of the Pittsburgh Steelers came to pay their respects, including the owner, the general manager, dozens of players and Mike Tomlin, the head coach, who lives in Squirrel Hill. Michele Rosenthal, one of the sisters of the David and Cecil, worked for the Steelers until several years ago.The service began with a quiet procession of firefighters in dress uniform from Engine 18, a station not far from Tree of Life, where David Rosenthal would spend his afternoons. One by one, they came to the front of the sanctuary and quietly saluted the two simple wooden coffins.A letter from David Zubik, the Catholic bishop of Pittsburgh, was read. Prayers were sung, psalms read about the valley of the shadow of death. But little was spoken of the grim circumstances that led to the service. Much of the eulogizing centered on its opposite, the kindness and purity of the brothers, who were both developmentally disabled.Michael Hirt, a brother-in-law, talked of how David and Cecil were distinctive, though they were often referred to simply as \u201cthe boys.\u201d There was David, the younger brother, the stickler for cleanliness, who carried a police scanner wherever he went and was the right hand of his mother. And Cecil, the socialite and inveterate gossip, the one who knew everyone, the informal mayor of Squirrel Hill, the mirror image of his father.David and Cecil would meet everyone coming through the doors at Tree of Life, arriving earlier than everyone else and handing out prayer books as people walked in the door.\u201cThe definition of beautiful souls,\u201d Rabbi Myers said at the service. And in the rare allusion during the ceremony to the horror that led to their deaths, he added, \u201cnot an ounce of hate in them, something we\u2019re terribly missing in society today.\u201dThe service ended and the mourners prepared to proceed to the cemetery. But other events were not far from people\u2019s minds.\u201cHey, are you going to be there at 4, at the protest?\u201d one man asked another amid the crowds on the way out of the synagogue.\u201cI\u2019ll be there,\u201d the other man said.Reporting was contributed by Kim Lyons from Pittsburgh, Ken Belson from New York, Sabrina Tavernise from Washington, and Jennifer Medina from Los Angeles.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byVery pragmatic advice for anyone thinking about not casting a ballot.Contributing Opinion WriterA young woman in Milwaukee recently asked me if I had any advice for disillusioned young voters. She said that in a representative democracy it was hard to want to vote for, in her words, \u201cyet another 40,000-year-old white man\u201d who didn\u2019t look like her or have familiarity with her experiences. I could have offered a warm, gentle answer but these are not warm, gentle times. Given everything that has transpired since President Trump took office, I have no patience for disillusionment. I have no patience for the audacious luxury of choosing not to vote because of that disillusionment, as if not voting is the best choice a person could make. Not voting is, in fact, the worst choice a person could make.We are reaping what has been sown from voter disillusionment and we will continue doing so until enough people recognize what is truly at stake when they don\u2019t vote. A representative democracy is flawed but it is the political system we must work within, at least for the time being. We have a responsibility to participate in this democracy, even when the politicians we vote for aren\u2019t ideal or a perfect match. Voting isn\u2019t dating. We are not promised perfect candidates. Voting requires pragmatism and critical thinking and empathy and now, more than ever, intelligent compromise.Only 40 percent of Americans choose to vote during midterm elections, generally speaking. There has been a lot of talk about the importance of voting next Tuesday because we are desperate to change the political climate and the first step in doing that is shifting the balance of power in Congress. Politicians, their volunteers and progressive publications have been vigorously trying to get out the vote in a range of ways. We deserve a better class of politicians who recognize the greater good and act in service of that greater good rather than in service of amassing more power. We deserve politicians who are held accountable for their decisions. We deserve politicians from all walks of life, not just the same old wealthy white heterosexual people who are overly represented in all branches of the government.We also deserve to be disillusioned and disappointed with what our politicians, thus far, have offered. For the most part they have failed us spectacularly because they understand that radicalism doesn\u2019t play well even though radicalism is what we need now, more than ever. And it is certainly a travesty that universal health care and a livable minimum wage and civil rights and higher taxes on the wealthy are considered radical, but here we are.I am going to vote on next Tuesday but I can\u2019t say I am particularly optimistic about the impact my vote will have. Between the corrupt stranglehold the Republican Party has on political power and the incompetence and cowardice of the Democrats, voting feels futile. The politicians I will vote for don\u2019t represent me and what I believe in as much as I would like them to.Every single day there is a new, terrifying, preventable tragedy fomented by a president and an administration that uses hate and entitlement as political expedience. If you remain disillusioned or apathetic in this climate, you are complicit. You think your disillusionment is more important than the very real dangers marginalized people in this country live with. If you are feeling disillusioned, get over it, at least enough to vote and vote pragmatically. Tell your friends to vote. Drive people to the polls. Support candidates you believe in with your time or, if you can afford it, money. Volunteer for community organizations that address to the issues you most care about. Attend town halls held by your elected officials. Hold them accountable for the decisions they make with the power you give them. Run for local office. Do something. Do anything. Nothing will change by sitting at home for the midterms or any other election. We cannot afford disillusionment. We cannot afford to do nothing. Lives are at stake and if you don\u2019t recognize that, you are no better than those with whom you are disillusioned.Advertisement"}

It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L.

{"Headline": "On Politics With Lisa Lerer: Inside Murkowski\u2019s Vote on Kavanaugh", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.Senator Lisa Murkowski didn\u2019t say much. She mostly listened, as the group of women gathered in her office shared their stories of sexual violence.When Ms. Murkowski spoke, said Hilary Morgan, a consultant from Anchorage, it was to tell the women how her \u201cheart had been breaking\u201d for the last two weeks.\u201cShe said she\u2019s probably six inches shorter because of the weight of everything,\u201d said Ms. Morgan, who was part of that group of women, 130 in all, who had flown 15 hours from Alaska to Washington with less than a day\u2019s notice to meet with their senator.This morning, Ms. Murkowski voted no on advancing the confirmation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. She was the lone Republican to oppose him.It\u2019s easy to forget how hard it is to be an independent in Washington. Now, more than ever, this is a town with two teams. Our national mavericks \u2014 figures like Senator John McCain or Justice Anthony Kennedy \u2014 have mostly vanished.But if they have an heir, it may just be the female senator from Alaska.Her critiques of the president steal the spotlight less often than those of Senators Jeff Flake and Ben Sasse.But she\u2019s also more likely to actually vote against the administration, particularly when it would help Alaska. She opposed a Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act because of threatened Medicaid cuts, and was against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as education secretary because of risks to rural school budgets.Yes, those votes are outliers: She has also voted for a number of the administration\u2019s priorities, including the tax bill. But they\u2019re more opposition than nearly any other Republican senator, including Mr. Flake and Mr. Sasse, has shown during the Trump administration.Ms. Murkowski doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time worrying about being out of step with her party, says Andrew Halcro, an old friend who served with her in the Alaska Legislature.\u201cIf history is any indicator, she\u2019ll just shrug it off and continue to do her job,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve seen Lisa Murkowski take a tough vote for the last 20 years, her decisions have always come down to people, not politics.\u201dIf Ms. Murkowski is unique, perhaps it\u2019s because her home state\u2019s politics are unlike any other\u2019s.Her father, former Senator Frank Murkowski, appointed her to the Senate in 2002 when he became the state\u2019s governor. (She was picked over an up-and-coming mayor from Wasilla, Sarah Palin.)Eight years later, Ms. Palin backed another Republican, Joe Miller, who defeated Ms. Murkowski in the primary. Against the wishes of party leaders, Ms. Murkowski launched a write-in campaign. She won the election, largely thanks to the backing of women and Alaska Natives \u2014 an unusual coalition for a Republican.\u201cThere will be long-term resentment among Republican voters due to Senator Murkowski\u2019s lack of courage today,\u201d said Penny Nance, president of the conservative group Concerned Women for America. \u201cConservative women never forget.\u201dTheir remarks line up with those of national Republicans, who, polls show, strongly back Judge Kavanaugh. But, as always, politics in Alaska are a different story.Issues of sexual violence clearly weighed on Ms. Murkowski during her vote today. Judge Kavanaugh, she said in remarks to reporters outside the Senate chamber, is \u201ca good man.\u201dBut, she added, \u201cif people who are victims, people who feel that there is no fairness in our system of government, particularly in our courts, then you\u2019ve gone down a path that is not good and right.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with issues right now that are bigger than the nominee.\u201d____________________A remark by the Democratic Senate candidate in Tennessee, Phil Bredesen, caught our eye today, as we track how the campaigns are responding to the Kavanaugh confirmation.His stance cost him the backing of a top Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA Action. (They had not yet put any money into his race.)It\u2019s a political play that makes a lot of sense: Mr. Bredesen is running a tight race in a red state. He needs to win independents and disaffected Republicans. For a Democrat in Tennessee, publicly losing national Democratic support might be better than having it.____________________I spent the morning on Capitol Hill, observing all the chaos around today\u2019s historic vote.People packed themselves into the offices of senators (including Joe Manchin\u2019s, above).Everywhere Ms. Murkowski went, she was trailed by reporters.And outside the Capitol, the streets were flooded with protesters, many of whom were arrested.____________________There are so many! But here are five that come to mind, in reverse chronological order:_____________________________________________________________Thanks for reading.

{"Headline": "Novellas of Tokyo\u2019s Lost Generation, Newly Translated", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.A 30-year-old woman calls in sick to work and stays in bed all day. A couple enjoys four days of no-strings-attached romance after meeting at the theater. Although his plots aren\u2019t much to speak of, the Japanese playwright Toshiki Okada\u2019s first prose work to be translated into English roams into some dark, even disturbing, crevices of the mind. His characters have plenty of time to delve inward. If this were set in the 1990s, we might call these characters slackers; in Japan, they are members of that burgeoning demographic known as \u201cfreeters,\u201d a portmanteau of the English \u201cfree\u201d and the German \u201carbeiter,\u201d which means a temporary laborer. These young people, disenfranchised by a stalled post-recession economy, are conscientious objectors to the conveyer-belt lifestyle of salarymen. More than mere loneliness, it is their alienation from mainstream Japanese culture that Okada explores in his plays and now in this pair of novellas.The first and title story is based on Okada\u2019s play \u201cFive Days in March.\u201d It\u2019s set in Tokyo on the eve of the American invasion of Iraq, and captures the global ahistoric confusion of that time. There are antiwar demonstrations in the streets, but the 20-somethings in the story can\u2019t seem to work out their responses: \u201cI saw the protest march today too, and I thought about joining in, but in the end I couldn\u2019t bring myself to,\u201d one says with a shrug.The main character, Azuma, gets stood up at a movie theater, and when he stumbles upon a new love interest at the screening, she nervously asks his name: \u201cIt totally doesn\u2019t have to be a real name, just anything, like a screen name would be fine.\u201d (It\u2019s 2005; the internet is still populated by shadowy noms de plume.) Azuma isn\u2019t into that girl, though; he later hooks up with another and dispassionately decides to shack up with her at a love hotel in Shibuya, the city\u2019s equivalent of Times Square. They don\u2019t know each other\u2019s names, assumed or otherwise, nor do they trade phone numbers or email addresses. These details don\u2019t matter to them. Over four days, they never turn on the TV and only once venture outside, when they brush up against another Iraq protest. Instead the pair insulate themselves, talking \u201cmovies and manga,\u201d going through the motions of a fling without sentiment. Yet the outside intrudes. Azuma recalls, \u201cWe would be licking each other all over, wordlessly, almost automatically, and the image of the march would creep in to fill the space.\u201d\u201cMy Place in Plural\u201d features another character shirking real-world responsibilities. This second story takes place entirely inside a dank, moldy apartment in one of the capital\u2019s less desirable neighborhoods. A wife is home alone while her husband works his second job at a drugstore. She allows herself to mentally articulate everything she dislikes about him, starting with his relentless agreeableness: \u201cMy husband thinks that it\u2019s a good thing to be indulgent with me, he thinks that it\u2019s a way to be kind, and he\u2019s completely blind to the fact that all it does is make me feel worse.\u201dThe woman spends time surfing the internet; this leads to an even worse mood. In an experience that will be familiar to just about everyone, she observes that opening a new browser window invariably results in disappointment. \u201cIn the few seconds while the page loaded, I felt like I was holding out hope for something, though I\u2019m not sure what. But as soon as the content came on screen my hope vanished.\u201dOkada\u2019s style is hyperrealistic, punctuated with \u201clikes\u201d and \u201cwhatevers,\u201d and structured, like everyday speech, around rambling sentences that often go nowhere. He has spoken of the difficulties of translating his work into other languages, because of its \u201csuper-real\u201d style.. But this translation by Sam Malissa has a strange rhythm all its own. That \u201cEnd of the Moment\u201d was once a play comes through in its shifting perspective, which moves swiftly, drone-like, among characters. It\u2019s the more successful of the two narratives \u2014 compact, ruthless, governed by a persuasive sense of dread. In that sense, Okada captures the ennui that has paralyzed a generation.Amelia Lester is an Australian writer living in Japan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Legalizing Recreational Marijuana, Canada Begins a National Experiment", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAcross the country, as government pot retailers opened from Newfoundland to British Columbia, jubilant Canadians waited for hours in line to buy the first state-approved joints. For many, it was a seminal moment, akin to the ending of Prohibition in the United States in the 1930s.\u201cI have never felt so proud to be Canadian,\u201d said Marco Beaulieu, 29, a janitor, as he waited with friends outside a government cannabis retailer in the east end of Montreal. \u201cCanada is once again a progressive global leader. We have gay rights, feminism, abortion rights, and now we can smoke pot without worrying police are going to arrest us.\u201dIt called on the government to promise to change the law if it leads to increased marijuana use.Marijuana for medical purposes has been legal in Canada since 2001, and about 330,000 Canadians, including cancer patients, are registered to receive it from licensed producers.Pre-rolled joints, fresh or dried marijuana flowers, and cannabis oil are all permitted under the law. Cannabis edibles \u2014 like pot-infused jelly beans, peanut butter and coffee \u2014 won\u2019t be legal for another year.According to Canada\u2019s national statistics office, 4.9 million Canadians used cannabis last year and consumed more than 20 grams of marijuana per person.On Wednesday morning, the government announced that it would introduce legislation to make it easier for Canadians who had been convicted of possessing small amounts of marijuana to obtain a pardon.While the government is not offering a blanket amnesty, Ralph Goodale, the public safety minister, said at a news conference in Ottawa that as \u201ca matter of basic fairness,\u201d the government would seek to end the minimum waiting period of five years to apply for a pardon as well as waiving the fee of 631 Canadian dollars.The federal government has left the country\u2019s 13 provinces and territories to carry out the new legislation and set their own rules, creating a patchwork of regulations. Among many open questions are how the police will test drivers who may be high and how employers deal with employees who smoke before coming to work.\u201cCannabis is not a benign substance,\u201d Dr. Le Foll said. \u201cThere is a clear risk of addiction, and it can produce significant mental health issues if used by the wrong kind of people.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt took decades for the public to understand the risks of cigarettes, and the legalization of cannabis has taken place only over a few years.\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t want young people to feel stigmatized, for example, if they don\u2019t use cannabis,\u201d Professor Fallu said.After months of soaring share prices, though, the first day of legal marijuana sales initially saw steep drops in the value of marijuana stocks. That reversed somewhat in the afternoon, leaving the largest companies\u2019 shares down just slightly by the end of trading. Many analysts say the value of legalization was long ago priced to the shares\u2019 value.At the government cannabis store in Montreal \u2014 one of 12 in Quebec \u2014 a line stretched across a long city block on Wednesday morning. Some of the hundreds of people had waited since 3:30 a.m., anticipating the store\u2019s 10 a.m. opening.Kate Guihan, 29, a beautician, said she planned to celebrate the \u201chistoric moment\u201d on Wednesday night with several puffs on a joint. The low cost of government pot, she added, was a big draw for her, along with the fact that legal marijuana was screened and devoid of contaminants.In Halifax, the mood was similarly buoyant.\u201cWe are witnessing history,\u201d said Shawn King, the host of a countdown to legalization on a local radio station. \u201cMarijuana prohibition is ending after 96 years. There\u2019s going to be a generation of people that never knew it was ever banned.\u201dInside a government retailer in Halifax that looked like an Apple store, shoppers browsed for products including \u201cGhost Train\u201d and \u201cLemon Skunk.\u201d Bongs were on display. Some shoppers bought weed, and others accessorized.Others across Canada were ordering pot online from government stores.As online demand soared, stocks quickly ran out, creating fears of marijuana shortages.In New Brunswick, the government cannabis agency provided a step-by-step guide on its website on how to roll a joint.The stated rationale for legalizing cannabis was to tame an illegal multibillion-dollar trade. But from Toronto to Winnipeg to Vancouver, hundreds of illegal shops have indicated that they have no intention of shutting down, and the black market supply chain remains deeply entrenched.In Toronto on Wednesday, revelers \u2014 some wearing T-shirts that said \u201cWeed Won\u201d \u2014 packed a cannabis lounge in the city\u2019s bohemian Kensington Market, where some were smoking black market pot to the sound of reggae music.Toronto had 92 illegal dispensaries the day before legalization, though 56 were shut down Wednesday afternoon. One had a \u201cFor Rent\u201d sign inside its window. Others were shuttered.In Vancouver, dozens of illegal marijuana dispensaries defied the new law by selling, among other things, outlawed edible cannabis and marijuana-infused face creams.Some illegal shops in both cities are hoping to get licensed.\u201cFentanyl kills 11 Canadians a day,\u201d he said, referring to the powerful synthetic opioid that is a public health scourge in some cities like Vancouver. \u201cMarijuana does not.\u201dHe added, \u201cI don\u2019t expect a big crackdown on day one.\u201dIan Austen contributed reporting from Ottawa, Meagan Campbell from Halifax, and Catherine Porter from Toronto.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Were the Founders Against Slavery All Along?", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.It is impossible to comprehend American history without understanding slavery\u2019s role in every aspect of its early development. Eleven slaves built a wall to protect a fledgling Dutch colony in 1626. Within a century, those 11 grew to represent one in five residents of what is now Manhattan, the nation\u2019s first capital city and today\u2019s global financial capital. Ten of America\u2019s first 12 presidents were slaveholders, as were two of the nation\u2019s earliest chief justices.Slavery is at the heart of the nation\u2019s origin story. The core of our democratic institutions \u2014 from the presidency to the Congress to the courts \u2014 was shaped immeasurably by it. And yet it is one of the least understood and distorted subjects in American history. The hip-hop superstar Kanye West\u2019s bizarre remark this spring that slavery was \u201ca choice\u201d is just one of many examples. A recent report by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that a \u201cbare majority\u201d of social studies teachers said they are qualified to teach it. Educators also complained about unclear state content standards and inadequate curricular resources. The net result: High school students are virtually illiterate on the subject, and this has had severe consequences for our national life.Sometimes in plain view and often just beneath the surface, slavery rests uncomfortably in the middle of national debates about monuments, white nationalism, kneeling athletes, Donald Trump\u2019s election, policing, immigrant family separation, racial wealth disparities and so on. Its meaning and legacy are, in many ways, as fiercely contested today as was the case when the framers first debated how to make America great.Wilentz\u2019s words, at the time, struck a discordant note to the ears of many. Not only were activists on the left pushing for greater recognition of America\u2019s racist past, but a spate of recent books had been published with new evidence of slavery\u2019s indispensable role in the development of capitalism. From the very beginning, slavery was not a \u201cSouthern pathology\u201d but an essential part of a modernizing, global economy, wrote Sven Beckert, the Harvard historian and author of \u201cEmpire of Cotton: A Global History.\u201d \u201cSlave plantations, not railroads, were in fact America\u2019s first \u2018big business.\u2019\u201dSo what is the falsehood? What does Wilentz know that others have gotten so terribly wrong about the founding connection between slavery and racism? In his revealing and passionately argued book, he insists that because the framers did not sanction slavery as a matter of principle, the antislavery legacy of the Constitution has been \u201cslighted\u201d and \u201cmisconstrued\u201d for over 200 years. \u201cAlthough the framers agreed to compromises over slavery that blunted antislavery hopes and augmented the slaveholders\u2019 power,\u201d Wilentz writes, \u201cthey also deliberately excluded any validation of property in man.\u201dTo put it simply, the Constitution, as ratified in 1788, was less racist and pro-slavery than many have thought. The nation\u2019s founding document contained a fundamental antislavery ideal built into it. Enslaved people were defined legally as \u201cpersons\u201d and not property.The usual evidence for what the celebrated historian John Hope Franklin called the \u201csweeping constitutional recognition of slavery\u201d consists of the three-fifths compromise (with the enslaved counted for political representation as three-fifths of free persons), the continuation of the Atlantic slave trade until 1808 and the so-called fugitive slave clause. None of these provisions contained the actual words \u201cslave\u201d or \u201cslavery.\u201d Nowhere do these words exist in the Constitution, that is, until after the Civil War, with ratification of the 13th and 14th Amendments.Wilentz goes to great lengths and, at times, takes great pains to show how Northern antislavery delegates combined forces with some moderate Upper South delegates to ensure the United States \u201cwould not validate slavery in national law.\u201d All references to persons \u201cbound to service\u201d or \u201cheld to service\u201d were the deliberate and intentional consequence of these hard-fought efforts.Still, to critics at the time and to posterity this all looked like a hypocritical charade and a cover-up. Even those New Englanders whose professed antislavery commitments were beyond reproach, Wilentz finds, charged that \u201cthe framers had sneakily covered up their concessions to slavery with confounding euphemisms.\u201d Within weeks of the Federal Convention, Benjamin Gale, a Connecticut millowner, accused the delegates of writing a \u201cdark, intricate, artful, crafty and unintelligible\u201d document, the worst he\u2019d ever read or seen, he complained. \u201cWhy could they have not spoke out in plain terms \u2014 Negroes?\u201dOn the other hand, the inviolability of private property, then as now, meant that the most ardent pro-slavery delegates and supporters did not see subterfuge but surrender. They wanted explicit language to protect existing state slavery laws, enshrining their natural right to own human beings. Patrick Henry said he \u201csmelt a rat\u201d when he noted, as Wilentz explains, the \u201cabsence in the Constitution of any categorical guarantee to the slaveholders of their rights to property in man.\u201dThe difference between these two constitutional interpretations would shape the most consequential political debates over territorial expansion, the limits of federal power and one of the most basic questions of American democracy, whether or not blacks had any rights whites were \u201cbound to respect.\u201dAt root, the nagging question remains: What manner of nation is this?By the 1840s, Madison\u2019s secret was out, and yet slavery would continue to be a proxy for everyone\u2019s own American values, including Wilentz\u2019s. The United States, he writes, had by then become the \u201cwealthiest and most powerful slave society in the world.\u201d And neither truth nor reconciliation saved the country from a war that was the greatest hell on earth.In the end, restoring the antislavery intent of the Constitution leaves a more perplexing question at the heart of American democracy. If it is now correct to say that America\u2019s leaders got something right about racism in the beginning, why have they repeatedly gotten so much wrong ever since? That\u2019s a history lesson still desperately needing to be taught.An earlier version of this review misidentified the location of a condominium that sits atop New York\u2019s former slave market. It is on the water\u2019s edge of the East River, not the Hudson River. The review also misstated the name of the building across from the New York Stock Exchange. It is Federal Hall National Memorial, not the original Federal Hall, which was demolished in 1812.Khalil Gibran Muhammad is the Suzanne Young Murray professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study and the author of \u201cThe Condemnation of Blackness.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If you look at it, they\u2019re a disaster.\u201d\u201cThe new Democrats are radical socialists who want to model America\u2019s economy after Venezuela. If Democrats win control of Congress this November, we will come dangerously closer to socialism in America.

Mr. Trump\u2019s assertion that countries with single-payer systems are \u201cdisasters\u201d is contradicted by the fact that many advanced economies have such systems. Moreover, the president himself has expressed admiration for single-payer health care systems in the past.While both are single-payer models, they stop short of being truly socialist programs. Under the Canadian system and Mr. Sanders\u2019s proposal, the government reimburses private health providers like doctors and hospitals for their services.While its 1999 constitution calls for universal health care funded by the state, \u201cthe current health humanitarian crisis negates any fulfillment of this responsibility by the Venezuelan government,\u201d said Dr. Hermes Florez of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.This system is currently in ruins as a result of government mismanagement, a lack of accountability, corruption and competing constituencies, experts agreed. \u201cVenezuela\u2019s system is collapsing mostly because of regime type \u2014 corrupt semi-authoritarianism \u2014 rather than choice of health system,\u201d Mr. Corrales said.

Mr. Gillum all but accused Mr. DeSantis of being a racist, at one point spelling out on stage a slur used against African Americans.\u201cI know firsthand that when we start going down that road, it can be very, very deadly, so I condemn that,\u201d he said, before warning against \u201cjumping to conclusions\u201d about the explosives sent exclusively to Democratic politicians, and to CNN.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Mr. Gillum, 39, quickly turned the question on his competitor, assigning blame to the \u201ccollapsing of our political discourse\u201d under President Trump, an enthusiastic supporter of Mr. DeSantis.\u201cMy opponent, endorsed by him, has run this race very, very close to the Trump handbook, where we call each other names, where we run false advertisements,\u201d he said.Records made public on Tuesday suggested that Mr. Gillum knowingly took a free ticket to the hit Broadway musical \u201cHamilton\u201d from the undercover agents in August 2016. Mr. Gillum maintained in the debate that he did not know the agents had paid for it, though he acknowledged he should have asked to make sure.\u201cI arrived at the theater and received the ticket from my brother,\u201d Mr. Gillum said \u201cI should have asked more questions to make sure that everything that had transpired was above board.\u201dMr. DeSantis demanded that Mr. Gillum waive confidentiality in the state ethics inquiry, which will not be completed before Election Day. \u201cGet all the evidence and statements out there so the voters of Florida can know everything is on the up-and-up,\u201d he said.\u201cHow the hell am I supposed to know every single statement somebody makes?\u201d he responded. \u201cI am not going to bow down to the altar of political correctness.\u201dMr. Gillum looked on, mouth open, with a half-smile on his face.\u201cMy grandmother used to say, \u2018A hit dog will holler,\u2019 and it hollered through this room,\u201d he said, spelling out letter by letter the slur Mr. DeSantis\u2019s donor used. \u201cI\u2019m not calling Mr. DeSantis a racist.

Mr. Gillum portrayed Mr. DeSantis as an unchecked supporter of charter schools and an acolyte of Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Mr. DeSantis announced the release of his health care plan, tucked into his website a few hours before the debate, and defended the robust economy under Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, after Mr. Gillum said many Floridians still struggle to make ends meet.Tensions were so high that after the debate, representatives from each campaign broke into a shouting match before a gaggle of television cameras.Representative Matt Gaetz, a Republican, called Mr. Gillum a liar and accused him of \u201cplaying the race card.\u201d He told the former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine that he would have beat Mr. Gillum in the Democratic primary if the revelations about the \u201cHamilton\u201d tickets had come out earlier.Chris King, Mr. Gillum\u2019s running mate, said Mr. Gillum would prevail in a contest about personalities and integrity.\u201cWe\u2019re confident in the character debate,\u201d he said.Follow Patricia Mazzei on Twitter: @PatriciaMazzei.Advertisement"}

But for Mr. Ringelstein\u2019s supporters, it\u2019s the message that matters most. JAY, Maine \u2014 Zak Ringelstein, the Democratic nominee for Senate in Maine, grew up working class and paid off $150,000 of student debt after he and his wife founded a successful education technology start-up. Many politicians would treat such a rags-to-riches tale as a parable about entrepreneurship, but for him it is more complicated.His message is also \u2014 to put it lightly \u2014 something of a hard sell in Washington; even Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the only democratic socialist in the Senate, dwells less on critiques of capitalism than on policy ideas like a $15 minimum wage, which he has been unable to get passed.But Mr. Ringelstein is playing a long game. \u201cA lot of us were told go to college, get a degree, and so many of us then got into horrible debt and now they can\u2019t get a job in their field,\u201d said Mikayla Damon, 26, the vice chairwoman of the Maine chapter of the D.S.A. \u201cThe whole American dream promise they were sold has kind of died.\u201d\u201cGiven everything that we see in the news every day, it is a disheartening time to be a young American,\u201d said Alyssa Thompson, 18, a certified nursing assistant from Greene, Maine. She worked long hours at a gas station kitchen to pay for her C.N.A. certification and said the first words she associated with capitalism were \u201cgreed\u201d and \u201cabuse.\u201d But Democratic leaders have shown little appetite for a debate about capitalism. \u201cWe\u2019re capitalist,\u201d Ms. Pelosi replied. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is.\u201dThe Maine Democratic Party appears wary of Mr. Ringelstein, who ran unopposed in its June primary. He said he has received grudging support since then from the party, whose leaders he said discouraged him from running and did not call to congratulate him when he won.Advisers to his campaign said the party\u2019s canvassers do not talk him up or distribute his campaign literature to voters, focusing instead on Janet Mills, the Democratic candidate for governor, and Jared Golden, a candidate for the House. Phil Bartlett, the state party chairman, did not respond to messages seeking comment.The growth of the D.S.A. is one barometer of that trend. It has grown from 4,300 members in 2016 to roughly 50,000 today, with 166 chapters nationwide, not including 57 campus chapters at colleges and high schools, according to a spokesman, Lawrence Dreyfuss. It had 43 chapters and roughly two dozen campus groups in 2016.Ms. Damon said the group\u2019s membership in Maine ballooned to over 300 people after President Trump was elected, with the average age of its members dropping from around 60 to around 30. She called it \u201ca demographic shift.\u201d\u201cYou could call that anticapitalism, or you could call that just capitalism with a conscience, or you could call it a better way of doing society,\u201d Mr. Ringelstein said.Mike Connolly, a state representative and D.S.A. member in Massachusetts, echoed that caution. He said \u201cthe politics of the moment\u201d make it wiser to focus on specific issues like the cost of housing than to rail against capitalism.\u201cWhen we\u2019re trying to convince people or trying to make the case for things, these huge policy areas are a key step in getting to a place where we can have a democratically controlled economy that is more consistent with socialism than with capitalism,\u201d Mr. Connolly said. Kaniela Ing, a Democratic state representative in Hawaii, agreed. He said his doubts about capitalism were not \u201cdogmatic\u201d but were based on conditions in his Maui district, where the cost of living is high.\u201cOften these debates get framed in an academic sense, which -ism is better, but that\u2019s not the conversation I am hearing,\u201d said Mr. Ing, who lost a Democratic congressional primary in Oahu this year. \u201cIt is that we know the current system isn\u2019t working \u2014 it is guttural and common sense. People feel it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not looking for a better system because I am ideological; it is because I am pragmatic,\u201d he added. \u201cIf capitalism worked and we were able to live and most of us were able to make it when we tried, then I\u2019d support it.\u201dMr. Ringelstein made a similar argument at a candidate forum in the rural town of Jay last month. Standing in a drafty V.F.W. hall strung with American-flag bunting and Christmas lights, he told an audience about the time he went to a White House event on education reform. Once he got there, he realized he was the only person in the room who had ever worked as a public-school teacher. \u201cEveryone else stood to profit from the policy that they were creating,\u201d he told the mostly gray-haired crowd, which applauded when he announced his intention to more heavily tax the rich.\u201cIf you want to call that socialist, fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I stand with the people, not with any party or any corporation.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "This Election Season, Republicans\u2019 Deficit Focus Goes the Way of the Vuvuzela", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 In 2010, Representative Paul D. Ryan issued an ominous threat about the nation\u2019s deficit, one repeatedly echoed by Republican candidates as they marched toward a decisive takeover of the House that year.\u201cUnprecedented levels of spending, deficits and debt,\u201d Mr. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, wrote, \u201cwill overwhelm the budget, smother the economy, weaken America\u2019s competitiveness in the global 21st-century economy, and threaten the survival of the government\u2019s major benefit programs.\u201d\u201cThe Tea Party wave of 2010 was animated by federal spending, but that has definitely subsided,\u201d said Tim Chapman, executive director of Heritage Action for America, a conservative lobbying group that helped fuel the Tea Party movement that year, when the deficit had grown to roughly $1.2 trillion.While the deficit problem has many fathers, its exorcism from the Republican agenda has one: President Trump. \u201cThe focus of Trump\u2019s campaign was not on federal spending,\u201d Mr. Chapman conceded. \u201cHe wanted to focus on national security and tax cuts and making America great again. When he said that, a lot of the Republican base went with him.\u201dIndeed, the dismissal of debt was one of the earliest and most central components of Mr. Trump\u2019s reconfiguring of the entire Republican agenda once he got to Washington. \u201cThis is definitely one of the major issues that has transformed the Republican Party under Trump,\u201d said Rory Cooper, who served as an aide to former Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader in 2011. \u201cFree trade, Russia, the deficit and frankly the size and scope of government have all fallen to the wayside.\u201d\u201cThe evil party and the stupid party got together and called it bipartisan,\u201d Brian Riedl, a senior fellow in budget, tax and economics at the conservative Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, said of the big budget deal. \u201cThis is the beginning of a long-term avalanche caused by Social Security and Medicare costs that are only going to get worse every year. I project $2 trillion within a decade or $3 trillion if interest rates return to 1990s levels. So no, the tax cuts will not pay for themselves.\u201dBut tax cuts have been the single major policy success under the Trump administration in Congress, and both continue to say they will be a net positive for the United States Treasury. They are so confident, in fact, that many Republican lawmakers would like to pass another tax cut that would make many of the reductions in the first round permanent. Mr. Trump\u2019s sweet spot has never involved big changes to entitlement programs, even though the biggest fiscal hawks in Congress remain hopeful that he will get there.\u201cI think this issue still resonates with Republican voters and independent voters,\u201d said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, who led an unsuccessful charge to make big changes to Medicaid during Republican attempts last year to repeal the Affordable Care Act. \u201cIndividual candidates may well be focused on other issues, but there are many of us who still feel very strongly about this.\u201dAs to whether Mr. Trump will be helpful going forward on that front, \u201cit\u2019s unclear,\u201d Mr. Toomey said. \u201cI think the president did indicate he was not interested in taking on big entitlement programs early on. Under the right circumstances, I think he could be an ally.\u201dThe net result for Mr. Ryan, now the retiring speaker of the House, is that he will leave a legacy absent the signature issues that propelled his entire legislative career. \u201cThis Congress ended up being about tax reform,\u201d Mr. Cooper said. \u201cIt was the low-hanging fruit because there was a Republican coalition of Trump Republicans and establishment Republicans that united around tax reform.\u201dThe scores of Republicans who ran on the issue in 2010 and 2012 have largely become quiet about debt so as to not run against the Trump agenda, even as the tax cut has not been popular enough to use as a re-election case. So incumbents have turned to things like national security instead.\u201cWe have always believed candidates need to represent their states and districts,\u201d said Sal Russo, co-founder of Tea Party Express. \u201cSo we are not troubled when someone votes crosswise with us if they believe that it\u2019s necessary to adequately represent their constituents. Thus, we will support candidates around a broad range of issues.\u201dDemocrats will most likely not take up the cause in the Republicans\u2019 stead. The base of the party has shown very little interest in the issue and is looking toward candidates who want to expand Medicare to all Americans, as well as other tax-funded programs. What\u2019s more, with Republicans more or less abandoning the issue, they hand Democrats ammunition to charge that their party cares about deficits only when the Democrats are in charge.\u201cA core part of the Republican brand has been fiscal responsibility,\u201d Mr. Chapman, of Heritage Action, said. \u201cAnd it is not good for the brand when deficits continue to skyrocket under Republican control. We are working hard to see what we can do in these future legislative spending battles. But the truth is, conservatives have not sufficiently galvanized the majority of the country around the idea that debts and deficits are a major threat to our country.\u201dAdvertisement"}

The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index shed 3 percent on Wednesday, wiping out its gains for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 4.4 percent, and has fallen more than 12 percent since early September.Just over a month ago, the S.&P. 500 was up nearly 10 percent for 2018, with expectations that coming quarterly corporate earnings reports \u2014 juiced by a generous tax cut and strong economic growth \u2014 would keep sending stock prices upward. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.\u201cIt was kind of a market that was looking for a reason to have some money come out of it,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. \u201cAnd it found it.\u201dThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 608 points, or 2.4 percent, on Wednesday. And the Nasdaq has now fallen into correction territory \u2014 a decline of more than 10 percent from an earlier peak, which indicates a drop that\u2019s more serious than a garden-variety slump. The S.&P. 500 is down to 2,656.10, more than 9 percent off its recent peak on Sept. 20, meaning it, too, is nearing a correction. Some market observers think that investors may be moving to the sidelines before what could be a very close and bitter election. \u201cI think people just want to clear the decks and get the heck out before the midterm elections, frankly,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. President Trump has repeatedly cited the strong performance of the stock market as evidence of the success of his administration\u2019s business-friendly approach. And as the market has slid lately, he has ratcheted up his criticism of the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to raise interest rates as economic growth remains strong. Low interest rates have helped support economic growth and the stock market since the financial crisis 10 years ago. But with unemployment at a 49-year low, the Fed is now raising interest rates, saying it wants to keep the economy from overheating, which could set off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again at its next meeting in December.The rise in interest rates has been particularly painful for some pockets of the markets. Shares of homebuilders are down more than 16 percent this month, as rising mortgage rates have made houses less affordable. Smaller companies \u2014 which are heavily exposed to floating-rate debt \u2014 have also been hurt by rising rates, which increases the cost of their debt payments. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks has fallen more than 13 percent in October. And the president\u2019s trade war with China has increasingly preoccupied the markets, analysts said. Official numbers released by Beijing last week showed China\u2019s economic growth has slowed to 6.5 percent, its lowest level since 2009. The slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, could mean falling sales for American companies that export to that market. As large consumers of metal who have invested heavily to gain access to the Chinese auto market \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 carmakers are particularly vulnerable to such risks. On Wednesday, Ford cited weak sales in China for falling profits. Company officials said issues surrounding trade disputes \u2014 including tariffs on imported steel and aluminum \u2014 could cost Ford $1 billion this year. \u201cWhat is really happening here is that people are saying, \u2018We just don\u2019t know about trade. We don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to hit the margins or the earnings streams next year,\u2019\u201d said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm Weeden & Company. Mr. Purves said investors were eager for a resolution to the trade dispute and nervous that it could escalate further.\u201cI think there is a game of chicken going on between Trump and the markets right now,\u201d he added. On Wednesday, the market tumble snowballed over the course of the day. Technology companies that have driven big market gains were badly battered. Shares in the tech heavyweights Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all fell more than 5 percent. Netflix fell more than 9 percent after a media report that Apple planned to announce a subscription television service that would go head-to-head with its streaming service. The news wasn\u2019t all bad for tech. Later Wednesday, Microsoft reported results that exceeded analyst expectations, sending its shares higher in after-hours trading. And Tesla shares also rose in after-hours trading after the electric-car maker reported its first profit in two years. Advertisement"}

It is no longer about an ideology; it\u2019s about shining President Trump\u2019s shoes. And that is the fundamental issue hanging over the midterm elections.\u201cIt must pay a heavy price for its embrace of white nationalism and know-nothingism,\u201d Boot continues. \u201cOnly if the G.O.P. as currently constituted is burned to the ground will there be any chance to build a reasonable center-right political party out of the ashes.\u201dThough I have often disagreed with past Republican leaders, I also noted some great accomplishments, from the superb diplomacy of George H.W. Bush after the Cold War to the lifesaving AIDS program of George W. Bush in the 2000s.Historically, Republicans were associated with fiscal conservatism, free trade and standing up militarily to autocrats in Moscow. But what does the party stand for today?The most odious pirouette may involve deficit spending. During the height of the 2008-9 recession, not a single Republican House member voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to stimulate the economy.It\u2019s difficult to explain the G.O.P.\u2019s resistance to a stimulus during the recession except as a willingness to let millions of Americans lose their jobs in hopes that President Barack Obama would get blamed. It can\u2019t have been about deficits, because Republicans then passed a tax cut for rich Americans that adds $1.4 trillion to deficits.The Republican turnabout on Russia is similar. Just a few years ago, Republicans denounced Democrats for being too trusting of Vladimir Putin \u2014 and they had a point \u2014 yet now they line up behind a president who gushes about Putin.But congressional Republicans have been spineless about a president who tears immigrant children from parents, declares his \u201clove\u201d for a North Korean leader who is still adding to his nuclear arsenal, and accepts large sums from the Saudi government in his hotel empire even as he downplays its torture-murder of a Washington Post journalist.Granted, a certain amount of hypocrisy is human. Democrats rage at evangelical Christians who embrace a philanderer, but they themselves denounce corruption while still supporting Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.S. Withdraws From 1955 Treaty Normalizing Relations With Iran", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the United States was pulling out of a six-decade-old treaty with Iran that had provided a basis for normalizing relations between the two countries, including diplomatic and economic exchanges.But in his announcement, Mr. Pompeo made clear that the United States would ignore the ruling \u2014 simply by scrapping the bilateral treaty with Iran.\u201cThe Iranians have been ignoring it for an awfully long time,\u201d Mr. Pompeo told reporters at the State Department.He said the legal complaint amounted to an attempt by Iran to interfere with the sovereign rights of the United States. He also said that the court\u2019s decision was outside its jurisdiction and that Iran\u2019s appeals \u201clacked merit.\u201dStill, he said, the United States would continue to try to deliver humanitarian aid to the Iranian people, and existing exceptions to the economic sanctions would remain in effect.After Mr. Pompeo\u2019s announcement, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran said on Twitter that the United States was an \u201coutlaw regime.\u201d He praised the court\u2019s ruling earlier, saying it marked \u201canother failure\u201d for the \u201csanctions-addicted\u201d United States and \u201cvictory for rule of law.\u201dIn legal terms, the United States withdrawal from the 1955 treaty with Iran does not take effect immediately. The treaty remains in place for one year from any announcement of withdrawal, meaning Iran\u2019s lawsuit will proceed.It was negotiated after the C.I.A. helped stage a coup in Iran that Iranians still cite as a gross violation of the country\u2019s sovereignty. The 1953 coup, code-named Operation Ajax, was engineered by Kermit Roosevelt Jr., a grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt, and installed a government that two years later cemented the treaty with President Dwight D. Eisenhower.The treaty sets up commercial relationships, tax structures and access to each nation\u2019s courts. None of that has applied since the 1979 Islamic revolution.\u201cThe treaty with Iran is a weird treaty,\u201d said Julian Ku, a professor of constitutional and international law at Hofstra University Law School. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been friends with Iran in a long time.\u201dLawyers for the United States had argued that the sanctions dispute with Iran was a matter of American national security, and therefore the court had no jurisdiction to intervene. Rulings by the International Court of Justice are legally binding but difficult to enforce; in the past, both the United States and Iran have ignored its orders.Wednesday\u2019s unanimous order by the court\u2019s 15 judges \u2014 including one American \u2014 stopped far short of outright siding with Iran, which had asked for an immediate halt to all sanctions.At the White House, John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, separately announced that the United States would review all treaties that require it to participate in cases before the international court. Additionally, he said the Trump administration would no longer abide by an optional provision to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations that requires certain disputes to be settled by the court.The United States remains in the Vienna Convention itself, but Mr. Bolton was aiming to undermine a lawsuit filed last week by Palestinian officials over the move of the American Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.\u201cThe United States will not sit idly by as baseless, politicized claims are brought against us,\u201d Mr. Bolton said.Robert Malley, the president of the International Crisis Group and a former White House coordinator for the Middle East, North Africa and the Gulf during the Obama administration, said Mr. Bolton\u2019s statement underscored \u201cwhy the Trump administration is increasingly isolated on the world stage.\u201d\u201cThis bellicosity undermines U.S. interests and, by escalating tensions and forfeiting diplomacy, risks putting us on a path toward conflict in the Middle East,\u201d Mr. Malley said.Last week, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said he would consider re-entering negotiations with the United States \u2014 if Mr. Trump first recommitted to the nuclear deal that was struck in 2015.But in withdrawing from the 1955 treaty on Wednesday, Mr. Pompeo also appeared to reject the idea of returning to normalized relations with Iran. That was the overall, long-term objective of the 2015 nuclear accord, in addition to having Iran agree to moving 97 percent of its nuclear material outside its borders.In early November, the United States is expected to impose a broad series of additional sanctions against Tehran that will threaten to cut off companies around the world that also do business with Iran.Administration officials are looking to force Iran to withdraw its troops and militias it supports in Syria.In Yemen, despite large numbers of civilian casualties and growing outrage among American legislators, the United States has continued to support a war being waged by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates against the Iranian-backed Houthis.No one was injured in the strikes, which landed on the perimeter of the airfield near the consulate building. Senior State Department officials had debated for more than a year whether to shut down the consulate to save money.Mr. Pompeo cited \u201csolid\u201d intelligence indicating that Iran was behind the attacks.\u201cWe can see the hand of the ayatollah and his henchmen,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said on Wednesday, referring to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Marlise Simons contributed reporting from Paris, Alan Cowell from London and David M.

{"Headline": "Greenhouse Gas Emissions From Plastics Are Predicted to Rise ", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA sharp increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the petrochemical industry \u2014 which includes plastic, fertilizer and pharmaceutical companies \u2014 threatens to erode climate benefits from reductions in other sectors, according to a report being issued Friday.Petrochemicals are currently the largest industrial energy consumer and the third-largest industrial emitter of greenhouse gas emissions. The report found that direct greenhouse gas emissions from petrochemicals would increase 20 percent by 2030 and 30 percent by 2050.The main driver of the petrochemical industry\u2019s growing climate footprint, according to the report, will be plastics. Worldwide, roughly 300 million metric tons of plastic are produced each year. While it may be easy to switch from bottled water to a refillable container, other plastics are not so easy to replace. In hospitals, for example, IV drips that were once made of glass are now made of plastic because it is cheaper and plastics are less likely to shatter. Petrochemicals are also a fundamental part of the pharmaceutical industry. The predicted increase in petrochemicals will also be driven by an increase in fertilizer use, the result of population growth along with a growing global economy. As developing countries, especially those with larger populations, increase their wealth, they will quite likely increase the use of fertilizer, much of which is produced from natural gas. The report estimates that by 2030, roughly seven percent of increased demand in natural gas will come from petrochemical companies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Fed Is Relaxing Banking Rules. What Goodies Are the Banks Getting?", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Federal Reserve proposed on Wednesday loosening rules for 16 financial institutions, an important move forward in the Trump administration\u2019s effort to roll back bank regulation.The Fed\u2019s proposals would affect banks with $100 billion to $700 billion in assets, including U.S. Bancorp, Capital One and American Express. The changes would not apply to the nation\u2019s eight largest banks, like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, which have significantly more loans and securities on their balance sheets.In May, Congress passed the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act, which pares back some of the regulations introduced after the financial crisis of 2008. The aim was to reduce compliance costs for many banks. Supporters of the law also contended that the banks it covers would not pose a big risk to the wider economy if they were to fail.The act required the Fed to examine banks with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion and draft specific rule changes that would lessen regulatory burdens. But the Fed\u2019s latest proposals would also relax rules for some banks that have more than $250 billion in assets, which drew criticism from Lael Brainard, a Fed governor appointed by the Obama administration.The Fed\u2019s deregulation comes at a time when banks do not seem to be weighed down by regulation. Bank profits are surging, and they are making large payouts to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks.Still, Randal K. Quarles, who President Trump appointed to the Fed to oversee bank supervision, said of the Fed\u2019s proposals, \u201cI am hopeful that firms will see reduced regulatory complexity and easier compliance with no decline in the resiliency of the U.S. banking system.\u201dPerhaps the most significant change concerned a rule aimed at making sure banks have enough cash in times of crisis. The rule, known as the liquidity coverage ratio, requires banks to stockpile so-called liquid assets (like Treasury securities) that can be sold quickly to raise cash during a crunch period. The Fed\u2019s proposal would allow 11 banks, including large regional lenders like SunTrust and BB&T, to stop complying with the ratio altogether, and it relaxes the ratio for four other firms. The Fed would still require the banks that get to drop the ratio to comply with other liquid standards. But Ms. Brainard said in a statement that the expected reduction in liquid assets would make it more likely that the affected banks would come under greater stress during challenging financial conditions.Another big change proposed Wednesday concerned the tests the Fed performs on banks once a year to assess whether they have the financial strength to make it through a financial and economic shock. Bank executives have long complained of the high cost of complying with the tests, but regulators have contended the tests help them and bank executives better understand the risks in their businesses. Under the proposals, 11 banks will be subject to tests once every two years.No bank with over $100 billion in assets will escape the stress tests altogether, a signal of their importance to regulators. The Fed also did not relax rules regarding so-called living wills, the plans that banks must draw up to make it easier for regulators to wind down failing firms. But the Fed said proposed changes to the living wills would be coming soon.The May legislation also contained language that gave the Fed leeway to adjust regulations for firms with more than $250 billion in assets. In reviewing regulation for these bigger banks, the Fed looked at the risks in the businesses of banks with up to $700 billion in assets. PNC Financial Services has $380 billion in assets, and though it is above $250 billion, it is in a category of banks that would, under the Fed\u2019s proposals, enjoy the relaxed liquidity rules. Northern Trust, with a much lower $132 billion in assets, is in a category that does not get that break. The reason is that Northern Trust has significant business overseas. PNC is more of a traditional regional lender.Still, in a statement on Wednesday, Ms. Brainard said the proposals softening the requirements for banks with between $250 billion and $700 billion went \u201cbeyond the provisions\u201d of the legislation passed in May. The proposed changes \u201cweaken the buffers that are core to the resilience of our system,\u201d she added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Robert Pitofsky, Champion of Consumer Protection, Dies at 88", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRobert Pitofsky, who as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission in the Clinton administration advocated stricter enforcement of competition and greater protection for consumers, died on Oct. 6 at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 88.The cause was complications of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, his son David said.Mr. Pitofsky was a leading figure in competition law. An antitrust scholar and a former dean of the Georgetown University law school, he wove in and out of government, private law practice and academia over his career.President Bill Clinton appointed Mr. Pitofsky to head the Federal Trade Commission in 1995. At the time, it was a sleepy agency colloquially referred to as \u201cthe little old lady of Pennsylvania Avenue.\u201dMr. Pitofsky soon sought to call attention to the growing threat of corporate consolidation, particularly with the rise of technology. During his tenure the agency would become the central watchdog for the internet and technology industries.Mr. Pitofsky won support from consumer groups that had pushed for greater scrutiny of mergers and stronger consumer protection in matters like deceptive advertising. But he was also criticized by some free-market conservatives and antitrust lawyers, who said he was trying to expand antitrust enforcement too far.Early on Mr. Pitofsky held public hearings to gather input on how the F.T.C. might look beyond traditional views of antitrust enforcement to better account for the modernization of the economy and the growth of technology.Mr. Pitofsky\u2019s push to update antitrust policy has echoes today, as the F.T.C. is again opening debate on how it approaches competition enforcement in the tech sector. Consumer groups and some lawmakers have raised concerns that a handful of companies, like Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple, have outsize influence on the economy even though they apparently do not violate antitrust laws.Last month, at the first of a series of F.T.C. hearings on antitrust at the Georgetown Law Center, Joe Simons, the current chairman, said he was modeling the hearings after those held by Mr. Pitofsky in 1995.Mr. Simons, who was a student of Mr. Pitofsky\u2019s at Georgetown, said in a statement this week that Mr. Pitofsky was \u201cone of the true giants of his field\u201d and that he had been \u201cinstrumental in establishing a strong bipartisan consensus on how to do antitrust enforcement and policy.\u201dAs F.T.C. chairman, Mr. Pitofsky sought to block nearly a dozen mergers, including that of the office-supply retailers Staples and Office Depot. The companies tried to merge again in 2015 but were again blocked.The agency under Mr. Pitofsky also filed to block the merger of BP Amoco with Atlantic Richfield, until BP agreed to sell off $7 billion worth of Arco\u2019s Alaska oil assets to Phillips Petroleum. In 2000, however, the agency ultimately agreed to approve Time Warner\u2019s $165 billion merger with AOL, with certain conditions.He pledged to make antitrust apolitical and to balance free-market interests with concerns that consolidation among corporations was threatening consumer welfare.Robert Pitofsky was born in Paterson, N.J., on Dec. 27, 1929, to Morris and Sadye Pitofsky. His father fixed textile looms, and his mother sold dresses.He graduated with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English literature from New York University in 1951 and earned a law degree at Columbia Law School in 1954. He served in the Army for two years before joining the private law firm Dewey, Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood in New York, where his first case was defending Eli Lilly against antitrust charges. In 1964 he began teaching law courses at New York University.Mr. Pitofsky joined Georgetown University\u2019s law school in 1973 as a professor and stayed until 1978, when he was appointed an F.T.C. commissioner. He returned to Georgetown Law in 1981 and became dean in 1983. He held that position until 1989.In addition to his son David, Mr. Pitofsky is survived by his wife, Sally Levy Pitofsky; another son, Alex; a daughter, Liz Pitofsky; and seven grandchildren.Mr. Pitofsky returned to teaching several times over the years. In addition to Mr. Simons, President Trump\u2019s nominee to the F.T.C., his students included Christine Varney, who was in charge of antitrust at the Justice Department during the Obama administration.In an interview with Washington Lawyer in 2002, Mr. Pitofsky said, \u201cI think a really good class is one of the great pleasures in life.\u201dAdvertisement"}

When evangelicals joined them, they understood what kind of church they were in. And when Republican holdouts submitted, they didn\u2019t convince themselves that they had judged him too harshly on testimony too scant. They just decided that a pardon was in their self-interests, and they bit their tongues until they lost the ability to speak.Trump enjoys a kind and degree of immunity that few if any politicians in my lifetime have been given. His own exhaustively established indecency inoculates him. As a result, all manner of ugliness slips by \u2014 unnoticed, barely noticed or noticed and accepted as Trump being Trump.But there\u2019s more to it than that.

{"Headline": "Major Climate Report Describes a Strong Risk of Crisis as Early as 2040", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe authors found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the atmosphere will warm up by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels by 2040, inundating coastlines and intensifying droughts and poverty. Previous work had focused on estimating the damage if average temperatures were to rise by a larger number, 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius), because that was the threshold scientists previously considered for the most severe effects of climate change. The new report, however, shows that many of those effects will come much sooner, at the 2.7-degree mark.It may sound small, but a half-degree of temperature change could lead to more dire consequences in a warming world, according to a sweeping new scientific assessment.Avoiding the most serious damage requires transforming the world economy within just a few years, said the authors, who estimate that the damage would come at a cost of $54 trillion. But while they conclude that it is technically possible to achieve the rapid changes required to avoid 2.7 degrees of warming, they concede that it may be politically unlikely. The report was written and edited by 91 scientists from 40 countries who analyzed more than 6,000 scientific studies. The Paris agreement set out to prevent warming of more than 3.6 degrees above preindustrial levels \u2014 long considered a threshold for the most severe social and economic damage from climate change. But the heads of small island nations, fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming.Absent aggressive action, many effects once expected only several decades in the future will arrive by 2040, and at the lower temperature, the report shows. \u201cIt\u2019s telling us we need to reverse emissions trends and turn the world economy on a dime,\u201d said Myles Allen, an Oxford University climate scientist and an author of the report. To prevent 2.7 degrees of warming, the report said, greenhouse pollution must be reduced by 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, and 100 percent by 2050. It also found that, by 2050, use of coal as an electricity source would have to drop from nearly 40 percent today to between 1 and 7 percent. Renewable energy such as wind and solar, which make up about 20 percent of the electricity mix today, would have to increase to as much as 67 percent.\u201cThis report makes it clear: There is no way to mitigate climate change without getting rid of coal,\u201d said Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University and an author of the report.Ms. Warrick said her organization intends to campaign for governments to invest in carbon capture technology. Such technology, which is currently too expensive for commercial use, could allow coal to continue to be widely used.Despite the controversial policy implications, the United States delegation joined more than 180 countries on Saturday in accepting the report\u2019s summary for policymakers, while walking a delicate diplomatic line. A State Department statement said that \u201cacceptance of this report by the panel does not imply endorsement by the United States of the specific findings or underlying contents of the report.\u201dThe State Department delegation faced a conundrum. Refusing to approve the document would place the United States at odds with many nations and show it rejecting established academic science on the world stage. However, the delegation also represents a president who has rejected climate science and climate policy.\u201cWe reiterate that the United States intends to withdraw from the Paris agreement at the earliest opportunity absent the identification of terms that are better for the American people,\u201d the statement said.The report attempts to put a price tag on the effects of climate change. The estimated $54 trillion in damage from 2.7 degrees of warming would grow to $69 trillion if the world continues to warm by 3.6 degrees and beyond, the report found, although it does not specify the length of time represented by those costs.The report concludes that the world is already more than halfway to the 2.7-degree mark. Human activities have caused warming of about 1.8 degrees since about the 1850s, the beginning of large-scale industrial coal burning, the report found.We know. Global warming is daunting. So here\u2019s a place to start: 17 often-asked questions with some straightforward answers.The United States is not alone in failing to reduce emissions enough to prevent the worst effects of climate change. The report concluded that the greenhouse gas reduction pledges put forth under the Paris agreement will not be enough to avoid 3.6 degrees of warming.The report emphasizes the potential role of a tax on carbon dioxide emissions. \u201cA price on carbon is central to prompt mitigation,\u201d the report concludes. It estimates that to be effective, such a price would have to range from $135 to $5,500 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution in 2030, and from $690 to $27,000 per ton by 2100. Americans for Prosperity, the political advocacy group funded by the libertarian billionaires Charles and David Koch, has made a point of campaigning against politicians who support a carbon tax. \u201cCarbon taxes are political poison because they increase gas prices and electric rates,\u201d said Myron Ebell, who heads the energy program at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an industry-funded Washington research organization, and who led the Trump administration\u2019s transition at the Environmental Protection Agency.The report details the economic damage expected should governments fail to enact policies to reduce emissions. The United States, it said, could lose roughly 1.2 percent of gross domestic product for every 1.8 degrees of warming.In addition, it said, the United States along with Bangladesh, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam are home to 50 million people who will be exposed to the effects of increased coastal flooding by 2040, if 2.7 degrees of warming occur.At 3.6 degrees of warming, the report predicts a \u201cdisproportionately rapid evacuation\u201d of people from the tropics. \u201cIn some parts of the world, national borders will become irrelevant,\u201d said Aromar Revi, director of the Indian Institute for Human Settlements and an author of the report. \u201cYou can set up a wall to try to contain 10,000 and 20,000 and one million people, but not 10 million.\u201dThe report also finds that, in the likelihood that governments fail to avert 2.7 degrees of warming, another scenario is possible: The world could overshoot that target, heat up by more than 3.6 degrees, and then through a combination of lowering emissions and deploying carbon capture technology, bring the temperature back down below the 2.7-degree threshold.In that scenario, some damage would be irreversible, the report found. All coral reefs would die. However, the sea ice that would disappear in the hotter scenario would return once temperatures had cooled off.\u201cFor governments, the idea of overshooting the target but then coming back to it is attractive because then they don\u2019t have to make such rapid changes,\u201d Dr. Shindell said. \u201cBut it has a lot of disadvantages.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Red-Hot Economy? Women Aren\u2019t Convinced", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA remarkable gender gap has opened up in Americans\u2019 views of their own finances and the broader national economy.Men feel better about the economy than they have in over a decade. Women are far more skeptical. And the sharp divide has emerged since President Trump was elected two years ago.Asked how they expected the American economy to fare over the next five years, nearly two-thirds of men said they anticipated \u201ccontinuous good times economically.\u201d Women were more likely to expect \u201cperiods of widespread unemployment or depression.\u201d The gaps remain even between men and women who are similar in age, race, education and income.Polls by the Pew Research Center going back to the mid-2000s showed almost no gender gap on economic questions until Mr. Trump took office; since then, men have become significantly more confident, while women\u2019s confidence has stalled.The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment survey has long shown a small gender gap, but the divide grew after Mr. Trump\u2019s 2016 victory and in December reached its widest point on record. The gap has since narrowed slightly but remains larger than before the election.Men\u2019s and women\u2019s views of the economy have diverged since President Trump\u2019s election.Share of adults saying the economy is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent.\u201d Trump\u2019s term\u00a0\u200a\u2014Men50%Women2006200820102012201420162018Share of Democrats50%MenWomen2006200820102012201420162018Share of RepublicansMenWomen50%2006200820102012201420162018Share of adults saying the economyis \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent.\u201d Trump\u2019s term\u00a0\u200a\u2014Men50%Women200520102015Share of Democrats50%MenWomen200520102015Share of RepublicansMenWomen50%200520102015By The New York Times | Source: Pew Research CenterKylie Pierce and Paul Weeldreyer are both 38, both college graduates and both steadily employed \u2014 Ms. Pierce as a grant writer for a local nonprofit, Mr. Weeldreyer as a contract worker for Comcast. Both are financially stable but have struggled to build up savings or buy a home.But while their circumstances are similar, their views of the economy differ sharply. Mr. Weeldreyer, a Wisconsin native who lives in Denver, said the local job market was strong. To the extent that his finances aren\u2019t where he would like them to be, he blames his own choices earlier in adulthood, not the economy more generally. He is confident in the future.\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating not being able to buy a house and stuff, but I guess I don\u2019t lose sleep over it,\u201d he said. \u201cI guess it\u2019ll work out.\u201dMs. Pierce sees things differently. She says there are plenty of jobs where she lives in central New York State, but pay has lagged. She dreams of the day she can pay her bills the day they arrive, rather than stalling until payday.\u201cIt\u2019s gotten a lot harder to do the things that our parents may have done, buy the house and do all the American dream stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything in my life seems to be getting more expensive, and my wages are the same.\u201dTheir political views may also play a role. A registered Republican, Mr. Weeldreyer said he voted for Mr. Trump only reluctantly in 2016 and hadn\u2019t made up his mind about how to vote in next month\u2019s midterms. But he said the economy was \u201cprobably the one area where I would say the president is doing a good job.\u201d Ms. Pierce is a member of the progressive Working Families Party and said she strongly opposed Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda.Still, partisanship isn\u2019t the whole story. Among men who said they \u201cstrongly approve\u201d of Mr. Trump\u2019s overall performance, 76 percent said their finances were better now than a year ago, according to the SurveyMonkey survey. That sentiment was expressed by just 65 percent of women who gave Mr. Trump strong overall marks. Other economic questions reveal a similar gap.\u201cRepublican men are just more confident and more optimistic than even Republican women are,\u201d said Laura Wronski, a research scientist for SurveyMonkey.Mr. Trump has repeatedly promoted his economic record, and Republican strategists are hoping the strong economy will help hold off a potential \u201cblue wave\u201d of Democratic victories next month.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.Diana Shue-Willis is exactly the kind of voter Republicans need to win over to keep control of the House. A college-educated Navy veteran in Virginia Beach, Ms. Shue-Willis is a registered Republican. Her husband works in manufacturing \u2014 a core source of support for Mr. Trump, and an industry that has experienced a rebound since he took office.But Ms. Shue-Willis, 49, is pessimistic about the economy. She lost her house to foreclosure during the last recession and now worries that banks are repeating the mistakes that led to the financial crisis. She worries about the cost of health insurance, and about the jobs available for her daughter, who didn\u2019t earn a high school diploma. She said that the construction industry, where she works, was slowing down, and that she didn\u2019t believe the rosy economic figures she heard on the news.\u201cI think the unemployment rate they talk about on TV is misleading,\u201d she said.Ms. Shue-Willis said she wasn\u2019t sure whom she would vote for next month. She isn\u2019t impressed by her Republican congressman, Scott Taylor \u2014 or by almost anyone else in Congress, a group she called \u201ca bunch of squabbling hypocrites.\u201dIt isn\u2019t clear what, beyond partisanship, is driving the gender divide on the economy. Men have not notably outperformed women in their economic fortunes since Mr. Trump took office. Women have, if anything, received a slightly disproportionate share of jobs, and the pay gap for full-time workers narrowed slightly last year.But hiring has been especially strong in male-dominated sectors such as manufacturing, construction and mining, noted Jed Kolko, chief economist for the job-search site Indeed. That growth, Mr. Kolko said, may be making men more optimistic \u2014 particularly because those same sectors had been in a long slump.\u201cWe are in this unexpected and perhaps temporary moment where job growth is faster on average in traditionally male-dominated jobs,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s policies, Mr. Kolko said, probably have little to do with the blue-collar rebound. But that may not matter. Amber Wichowsky, a political-science professor at Marquette University, said that during the Obama administration, white men \u2014 particularly those without a college degree \u2014 reported feeling that their social status was eroding. Now that might be reversing.\u201cTheir guy\u2019s in office, the economy\u2019s doing well, it\u2019s an even bigger shot in the arm,\u201d Ms. Wichowsky said. \u201cThe psychology\u2019s really important.\u201dEven with the unemployment rate under 4 percent, however, millions of Americans are stuck in part-time or low-paying jobs, and many families have barely begun to recover from the Great Recession.\u201cYou have an economy that, although the stock market and unemployment rate look good, people\u2019s actual lived experience of making ends meet\u201d is less good, said Corrine McConnaughy, a political scientist at George Washington University.Ms. McConnaughy said the uneven nature of the recovery might affect men\u2019s and women\u2019s views of the economy differently. She said research had found that men, on average, gauged the economy based on their own financial situation. Women tend to weigh more heavily the experiences of the people they see around them.For Addie Chase, the economy is working fine. The shopping center that she and her husband own in Stratford, Conn., is fully rented, and she has a strong stable of students for her business as a piano teacher.But Ms. Chase, 67, said Connecticut as a whole was struggling economically. She sees people leaving the state in search of better opportunities, and she worries about the future. And she said her frustrations with the national political environment were hard to separate from her feelings about the economy.\u201cI just feel like I\u2019m angry all the time, which isn\u2019t my personality,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause women are so upset about how things are going, it colors their whole outlook.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Stock investors were whipsawed on Tuesday, as earnings from a pair of industrial firms initially added to concerns about the global economy, but a tumble in oil prices later propped up consumer companies.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index ended the day down 0.55 percent, at 2,740.69, after falling more than 2 percent. Stock markets in China, Japan and Germany \u2014 among the countries most heavily exposed to a slowdown in global trade \u2014 set the tone with overnight trading declines, before high-profile earnings reports in the United States added to the dour mood. After reporting weaker-than-expected third-quarter sales and profits, 3M fell 4.4 percent. The company cut its full-year estimates for profits, citing, in part, signs of a slowing Chinese economy. Rising commodity costs, and their potential to crimp profit margins that have been fattened by corporate tax cuts this year, have become a key concern for stock investors recently.\u201cThe market is quickly changing its focus toward whether the best news from tax cuts is already reflected in earnings,\u201d said Ed Clissold, chief United States strategist at the stock market research firm Ned Davis Research. \u201cEarnings are very unlikely to decline, but the growth rate is going to slow. So any sign that that inflection point is here is going to be viewed negatively by the market.\u201dThe drop in oil prices rippled through stock markets, sending American energy stocks down more than 2.5 percent.But falling energy prices also seemed to lift shares of companies that rely on consumer spending and could benefit as consumers spend less on gasoline. Companies selling consumer staples, such as groceries, rose slightly Tuesday. Even beyond staples, the picture wasn\u2019t all bad in the United States. Shares of the Pulte Group, a homebuilder, rose 7.3 percent after it reported stronger earnings on higher home prices, helping to pull its fellow homebuilder Lennar higher. That\u2019s a welcome sign for the industry, which has been hammered this year as rising mortgage rates have hurt affordability. McDonald\u2019s reported better-than-expected third-quarter profits and revenue, and its shares jumped 6.3 percent. And shares of Verizon rose more than 4 percent after its results exceed expectations. The electric-car maker Tesla surged more than 12.5 percent after the company announced late Monday that it would move up its third-quarter earnings announcement to Wednesday. Some analysts interpreted the move as an indication that good results were on the way. Tesla shares were also helped when a high-profile Tesla critic and short-seller, Andrew Left of Citron Research, made an about face and announced that he was now betting on a rise in the price. Such isolated bright spots have been swamped out by the overall gloom in the stock markets this earnings season as investors scour results for indications that earnings growth will slow. The S.&P. 500 is down more than 6 percent since peaking on Sept. 20. Back then, the benchmark stock market index was up nearly 10 percent for the year. The tumble in stocks has cut that gain to less than 3 percent. \u201cPeople have been assuming that both fourth-quarter and, more importantly, 2019 growth, in terms of G.D.P. growth and earnings, will continue along the path that it was on this year,\u201d said Matt Maley, an equity strategist at the brokerage firm Miller Tabak. \u201cAnd now we\u2019re hearing otherwise.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Estranged in America: Both Sides Feel Lost and Left Out", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNearly half of Democrats say they feel this way, slightly more than Republicans. In the 2016 election, Donald J. Trump tapped into a sentiment strongly held by white working-class voters that America had changed so much around them that they felt estranged in their own country.The seven districts that we\u2019ve polled on that question \u2014 talking to 3,555 likely voters in California, Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota and West Virginia \u2014 are not representative of the entire country. But they contain communities that are pulling ahead in America and those that are falling behind, as well as places that mirror the nation\u2019s demographic future and its past. \u201cNormally, even in a politically polarized society, one side wins and they\u2019re content,\u201d said Stephanie McCurry, a historian at Columbia University. \u201cIt\u2019s the other side that feels shut out of power.\u201dThe moment now reminds her of the 1850s, when Northerners and Southerners were locked in a morally imbued fight over the nature of American values \u2014 and whether America was at its core a slave-owning society. Many Northerners were horrified by the 1857 Dred Scott decision, which effectively declared the United States such a place. Southerners were horrified by Northerners\u2019 reaction to it, Ms. McCurry said.The Senate\u2019s rancorous fight over Judge Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation, she added, has similarly added to pessimism about resolving these conflicts. Ms. Hochschild identifies as a liberal herself, and after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, she said one of the conservative voters she described in her book sent her an email. That is precisely the feeling she had described in Louisiana. \u201cTrump is continually stoking these feelings of resentment, of loss,\u201d said Daniel Cox, the research director with the Public Religion Research Institute. \u201cIf you\u2019re already primed to feel that way, getting a sort of regular dose of that kind of rhetoric I think would cause you to continue to believe it.\u201dThe share of African-Americans saying the same rose to 59 percent from 48 percent (almost identical to what Times polls have found). Mr. Cox suggests, though, that while this sense of estrangement has been politically valuable to Mr. Trump in animating Republican voters, the same probably won\u2019t be true for Democrats. Feelings of loss on the left \u2014 a weakening of values around voting rights, abortion rights, LGBT tolerance \u2014 aren\u2019t as easily bound together in a singular cultural narrative.The fact that \u201cfeeling like a stranger in your own land\u201d can encompass all of these values is part of what makes it a powerful indicator of the American mood. The idea touches something more fundamental than policy preferences, more personal than how people view individual leaders.\u201cThis does get at something a little bit deeper, that \u2018I\u2019m really troubled by \u2014 insert your own thing,\u2019 \u201d said Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster. \u201c \u2018I\u2019m troubled by these political divisions, I\u2019m troubled by how things are going culturally, I\u2019m troubled by crime and the lack of moral fiber.\u2019 I don\u2019t think this sort of limits you.\u201dThere may even be something hopeful in the fact that many Americans are deeply troubled about something \u2014 if not the same thing.\u201cIt is evidence of a healthy process,\u201d said Heather Cox Richardson, a historian at Boston College. In the 1850s and the 1920s, she said, similar moments of widespread disaffection and anger with powerful elites led to broad grass-roots movements that gave way, in their time, to the birth of the Republican Party and later the election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. \u201cIt is also evidence,\u201d she said, \u201cof an exceedingly dangerous process for the people who are in power.\u201dNate Cohn contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "FIFA Averts \u2018Institutional Crisis\u2019 by Delaying Major Vote", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIGALI, Rwanda \u2014 Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, backed down on Friday from plans to hold a vote on the creation of two new competitions that would have meant profound changes for global soccer after he was told that they would lead to an \u201cinstitutional crisis\u201d for the sport.The last-minute about-face came after European members of FIFA\u2019s governing council threatened to walk out if Infantino forced a vote on the creation of a World Cup for clubs and a global league for national teams.Instead, the governing council pushed the decision down the road, approving the creation of a task force to evaluate the proposals, which hold the potential to alter global soccer significantly and provide FIFA with major new revenue streams beyond the men\u2019s World Cup.The decision amounts to an embarrassing retreat for Infantino, although he will lead the task force that is now expected to deliver detailed proposals for the new competitions by next March.The lack of approval casts doubt on the status of a 12-year, $25 billion offer to underwrite the competitions from a consortium led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, according to documents viewed by The New York Times.The Financial Times reported on Thursday that the investors would withdraw their offer if there was no agreement in Kigali, where the council is meeting. The investor group gave FIFA a 60-day deadline last March to agree to its offer, although talks continued as Infantino labored to find consensus. Infantino said the talks would continue.The process has angered organizations representing Europe\u2019s top leagues and clubs, who fear that any new FIFA competitions would come at their expense and would create an additional burden on players amid concerns that many are already overworked.Aleksander Ceferin, president of UEFA, the governing body for soccer in Europe, who had been leading opposition to the plans, had described the negotiations as \u201chighly cynical and ruthless mercantilism.\u201dWith relations between Ceferin and Infantino close to a breaking point over the issue, it was left to emissaries, including Victor Montagliani, a FIFA vice president, to work out a face-saving compromise.\u201cCommon sense prevailed,\u201d Ceferin said as he left the meeting.Infantino, who acknowledged that he could have handled the discussions better, said, \u201cI am happy to have contributed to peace in the world today.\u201dFor months, European leagues and clubs have accused FIFA of failing to take their point of view into account in considering projects that would have a profound effect on them.An analysis of the proposals for the new Club World Cup showed that players would in some instances be required to take the field every 48 hours, under one of the plans, and European representatives have called for a discussion on the soccer calendar before any other decisions are made.Ceferin arrived at the meeting armed with letters from three representative bodies. The European Club Association, the most powerful among them \u2014 it represents more than 200 top clubs \u2014 castigated Infantino for \u201cfailing to address challenges in an open and inclusive manner.\u201dForcing through the new events without more meaningful dialogue, the association wrote, would constitute \u201can institutional crisis with potentially severe and far-reaching consequences.\u201dThe letter was signed by executives from some of the world\u2019s biggest clubs, including Juventus, Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Paris St.-Germain. It was also backed by Real Madrid and Barcelona, the Spanish powerhouse teams, which had previously expressed support for the new FIFA competitions.The World Leagues Forum, a group led by Richard Scudamore, the executive chairman of the English Premier League, warned Infantino in a letter that adding new events without addressing the calendar risked \u201cendangering player health\u201d and that it could \u201cjeopardize the economy of football globally.\u201d\u201cWe do not understand the recklessness with which FIFA is acting on these competition and calendar issues,\u201d the forum said.Infantino, who in his previous role as the top administrator at UEFA had developed close relationships with many of those who are now criticizing him, seemed surprised at the extent of the opposition.\u201cI don\u2019t know why discussions about a football competition and football competitions around the world need to take such dramatic tones,\u201d Infantino said. He insisted that tournaments run by FIFA would benefit not just the top clubs but needier nations that are dependent on FIFA\u2019s largess.Infantino had tried, and failed, to push through an agreement in March, when he stunned members of FIFA\u2019s governing council with details of the $25 billion offer.He said he could not name the backers because of a nondisclosure agreement, even as he sought the council\u2019s permission to move quickly, citing a 60-day time limit on the offer.For its part, SoftBank has not commented on the negotiations, even though details of its involvement leaked six months ago. It recently hired the management consulting firm McKinsey and the sports marketing company IMG to conduct a financial analysis of its offer.Studies commissioned by the investors found that the return was likely to be well below the $25 billion guaranteed to FIFA. The proposal called for a guaranteed $2 billion for each edition of the national team competition and $3 billion for each Club World Cup.SoftBank did not respond to a request for comment on Friday.Advertisement"}

There are many ways to dig around for clues about such things \u2014 and this week we explored a few of them.Sometimes you get out in the streets... Their views on when government should intervene and when it should not are by no means universal, but the debate raises interesting questions about the way a local issue can feed into a sense of national and international identity.Does Sydney want to be a big global city like New York or Hong Kong where anything goes (at least in some places) and officialdom reacts to trouble as it emerges? Or does it want to prioritize prevention, safety and perhaps the calmer quality of life found in smaller cities?Sometimes you talk to officials...When I asked Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister, what he thought Australians wanted their country to be in an interview this week, he had a quick answer: \u201cAustralians don\u2019t know what they want.\u201dHe argued that the country should embrace the status of becoming \u201ca creative middle power,\u201d meaning that it should aim to grow its population to around 50 million, and begin to see itself in the same category as the United Kingdom and France.\u201cThat brings responsibilities,\u201d he said.Would a Labor government become more externally focused? Is the country becoming more willing to play a larger role?Mr. Rudd mostly demurred, choosing instead to explain that Australia\u2019s national psyche was still wrapped up in a history defined by distance and reliable alliances with major powers \u2014 first Britain, then the United States.Breaking away from that position, even when the United States is becoming more unpredictable, is still a major challenge.\u201cAustralians don\u2019t take themselves seriously as a regional and global power,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause they don\u2019t think anyone else would.\u201dSometimes you ask New York Times readers...Here\u2019s one thing we do know: Australians are extremely proud of their compulsory voting system and want the world to know about it.But I figured I\u2019d add a couplemore worthwhile responses from Australian readers about the compulsory voting system that didn\u2019t fit into the article.\u201cI don\u2019t see how a democracy can work without it.

The compulsion is minor, but the effects of this policy are huge. Look at when our elections take place \u2014 on Saturdays, ensuring EVERYONE can vote. Look at where the voting booths are \u2014 neighbourhood schools, gyms, places where the most people can go. And look at the sense of community when we vote. We turn up, chat to locals, buy fundraising sausages in bread and home made jams (they\u2019re known as democracy sausages). And we all vote.\u201d\u2014 Stuart PageAustralians often talk about not wanting to self-promote or even celebrate their own accomplishments, but clearly there are areas where confidence comes easily and is well-deserved.As the country moves closer to a federal election, there will be more signals pointing to Australia\u2019s urges and mood \u2014 the vibe, as fans of \u201cThe Castle\u201d would say \u2014 and we\u2019ll continue to try and put what\u2019s happening into context.Now here are a few other stories from The Times that you shouldn\u2019t miss, along with a recommendation.______Maybe it\u2019s also time for us to do something similar or more ambitious for cities in Australia.

{"Headline": "As Storms Keep Coming, FEMA Spends Billions in \u2018Cycle\u2019 of Damage and Repair", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDAVANT, La. \u2014 In the exact spot where Hurricane Katrina demolished the Plaquemines Parish Detention Center, a new $105 million jail now hovers 19 feet above the marsh, perched atop towering concrete pillars. Described by a state official as the \u201cTaj Mahal\u201d of Louisiana corrections, it has so much space that one of every 27 parish residents could bunk there.But on an average day in the first half of this year, more than 40 percent of its 872 beds went unoccupied, making it one of the emptiest jails in the state, records show. And because of its isolated, flood-prone location, the jail still must be evacuated before any major storm or risk becoming an accidental Alcatraz.There is but one reason the Plaquemines jail was rebuilt on endangered land, with needless capacity, at immense cost: The sheriff wanted it that way. But unlike most new jail construction, his project did not have to be financed through bond sales or other local revenues, with voters able to hold him accountable. Rather, because the old jail was destroyed by a natural disaster, the cost was covered by federal taxpayers, through a Federal Emergency Management Agency program that is required by law to distribute billions in aid but exerts little control over how the money is spent.FEMA\u2019s public assistance program has provided at least $81 billion in this manner to state, territorial and local governments in response to disasters declared since 1992, according to a New York Times analysis of federal data. But an examination of projects across the country\u2019s ever-expanding flood zones reveals that decisions to rebuild in place, often made seemingly in defiance of climate change, have at times left structures just as defenseless against the next storm.Other efforts have required enormously expensive engineering to ensure protection. Yet in some instances, restrictions on construction in flood plains have effectively prohibited FEMA from safeguarding its multimillion-dollar investments in new and repaired public buildings.Local officials desperate to restore normalcy to disoriented communities will get to decide how to spend those federal dollars \u2014 choices made more consequential, and costly, as sea levels rise and Atlantic storms generate greater surge and rainfall because of climate change. What once seemed random climatic misfortune now occurs more predictably. Coastal scientists and disaster recovery experts agree that if rebuilding in the same place once dared lightning to strike twice, it now tempts a more certain fate.For evidence, visit Princeville, N.C., a town of 2,000 on the Tar River. In 1999, a hurricane named Floyd engorged the river until it spilled over a levee, ruining the town hall, Princeville Elementary School, the police and fire station, the senior center and virtually every other structure.\u201cI thought, \u2018Once in a lifetime,\u2019\u201d said Mayor Bobbie Darnell Jones, who was rescued from his house by helicopter.Leaders of the town, which was settled by newly emancipated slaves, rejected suggestions from state officials to move the entire community to higher ground. Instead, FEMA spent more than $5 million in public assistance grants to clear debris, build a new town hall and school, repair other buildings and replace fire trucks, a garbage truck, even a riding lawn mower, the agency\u2019s records show.Since at least 1950, an empathetic nation has supported the impulse to rebuild in place by financing much of the cost of disaster recovery through the federal budget. But the process adheres to the American conviction that, regardless of who pays, decisions about land use and infrastructure should be made as locally as possible.With local officials often incentivized to replicate the past, experts in disaster relief say changes in federal law and regulations may be needed to reorient the system to reflect climate realities.Grants have gone to every state and territory, with New York and Louisiana the biggest recipients because of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005. About a fourth of the money has been used to repair and replace public buildings.In most instances, grants cover at least 75 percent of the cost to return a damaged building to its prior state while also complying with current codes. If the cost of repair is more than half that of replacement, FEMA will pay to build anew. The program also provides grants for hazard mitigation to minimize future damage.When structures in designated flood plains are rebuilt or repaired, FEMA requires that they be elevated to at least the 100-year flood level \u2014 high enough, that is, to withstand a storm with only a 1 percent chance of occurring in a year. Buildings that serve a critical function, like hospitals or power plants, must be raised to the 500-year level.The agency can pay to relocate destroyed buildings if it is deemed cost-effective, but it often isn\u2019t. In New York City, FEMA spent more than $700 million \u2014 with the city pitching in $80 million more \u2014 to repair 72 schools damaged during Sandy. But the city\u2019s high cost of real estate and construction dictated that only one would be moved, to an adjacent site where it will be elevated, according to the Mayor\u2019s Office of Recovery and Resiliency.Instead, the money was spent on measures that accepted the inevitability of future flooding, like raising vents, relocating electrical systems to rooftops and replacing drywall with building materials that could be easily dried and disinfected.But the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, recently found that the separate flood insurance program had paid $5.5 billion from 1978 to 2015 to repair and rebuild more than 30,000 properties that had flooded more than once. Claims for those residences and businesses had been submitted an average of five times.Critics see both FEMA programs as symptomatic of a disjointed and backward-looking approach to disaster planning that devotes inordinate resources to rebuilding at the expense of prevention.\u201cThe fundamental problem is that the entire system is reactive,\u201d said Jeff Hebert, vice president for adaptation and resilience at the Water Institute of the Gulf, a Louisiana-based research group. \u201cIt would be transformational if we took the money that we spend on disasters and instead spent it on the front end on really good adaptation.\u201dAmong Hurricane Katrina\u2019s victims was Lakefront Airport in New Orleans, a general aviation airport built on a jut of land reclaimed from Lake Pontchartrain. Politics drove the selection of the site in the 1930s, but it seemed a good enough idea. The airport would be close to the city center and could accommodate seaplanes, a popular mode of passenger transportation at the time.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.The classic Art Deco terminal, a working monument to the romance of flight, wowed travelers when it opened in 1934. Eight murals of exotic destinations ringed the second floor of a grand atrium, their locations corresponding to the directions on a compass rose inlaid into the terrazzo floor. Three years later, Amelia Earhart slept in the visiting pilots\u2019 quarters on her way to California for her final journey.In 1964, the terminal acquired a Brutalist concrete cladding that made it usable as a Cold War fallout shelter, and its glamour faded. But after Katrina flushed four feet of water through the building, the authority that runs the airport decided to restore its prior glory.It found a willing partner, up to a point, in FEMA, which provided $68.8 million in public assistance grants to repair the airport and its grounds, according to authority officials. That included $20 million for such a lush renovation of the terminal that it is booked regularly for charity galas and debutante balls.And yet, despite FEMA\u2019s substantial investment, the agency has been stymied by its own rules from taking steps to prevent a recurrence in the next big storm.The airport is not much more protected from Pontchartrain\u2019s storm surge than before. Parts are buffered only by a low bulkhead because of fears that a higher one might interfere with takeoffs and landings.In 2015, the airport\u2019s operator, known as the Non-Flood Asset Protection Management Authority, asked FEMA to provide an additional $65 million to build a pump system and movable flood wall that could be put into place before storms. FEMA refused, arguing in part that it would qualify as new construction, which the agency said it could not pay for in certain designated flood zones.The airport authority lost its appeal of that decision in July by the 2-to-1 vote of a federal arbitration board. In dissent, the chief judge, Jonathan Zischkau, wrote that the decision \u201cleaves the entire airport facility \u2014 and a considerable number of people \u2014 at risk and unprotected from future hurricanes and flood disasters.\u201dWilma Heaton, the chairwoman of the authority, said she was determined to continue searching for funds, but considered FEMA\u2019s position nonsensical.\u201cStorm after storm, we know what happens without adequate flood protection,\u201d Ms. Heaton said. \u201cNot addressing it is insanity.\u201dFew places have benefited from FEMA\u2019s largess like Plaquemines Parish, which protrudes southeast from the New Orleans suburbs into the Gulf of Mexico. And few places better embody the costly contradictions of rebuilding on endangered land.Plaquemines was pummeled by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 and again by Hurricane Isaac in 2012. Since 2000, FEMA has routed $902.1 million in public assistance grants to the parish for 1,000 separate projects, the Times analysis found, an average of $38,637 for each of the 23,348 current residents. That is barely less than the assessed value of all taxable property.With the exception of the New Orleans bedroom community of Belle Chasse, the parish consists largely of two narrow strips, bordered by levees, on either bank of the Mississippi River. Floodwater breached and topped the 16-foot mounds during Katrina, but they have since been repaired and fortified. Nonetheless, state scientists project that in the case of a 100-year storm, most of the parish outside Belle Chase would be submerged at least 13 feet.A fifth of the Plaquemines population left after Katrina, according to census estimates. But because FEMA will pay to rebuild to prior size and capacity, those changes have not always factored much into recovery planning.FEMA allowed the Plaquemines school board to consolidate and restructure its system after Katrina, including eliminating one of eight schools. But it nonetheless spent nearly $100 million to rebuild three schools on the west bank, and another $36 million to rebuild Phoenix High, the only one on the east bank.Like the jail, the new schools are engineering marvels, red brick fortresses raised more than 20 feet on a forest of columns. But some are clearly larger than needed. Phoenix was designed to accommodate 400 students from prekindergarten through 12th grade, but enrolled only 190 this fall, according to the school board. An average of 13 seniors have graduated each year since it reopened in 2012.School board officials said they had not been willing to bus students long distances to Belle Chasse or across the river by ferry.\u201cWe\u2019re obligated to provide an education for the people who are here,\u201d said Ronald E. White Jr., the chief financial officer. \u201cIt\u2019s not our job to say you can\u2019t live here.\u201d\u201cPlus we wanted to rebuild our communities,\u201d said Denis Rousselle, the superintendent. \u201cPeople would not come back if you didn\u2019t have schools.\u201dFEMA provided enough money to replace damaged contents that the system was able to refurnish even the schools that were not destroyed, Mr. Rousselle said.\u201cThey\u2019ve been so generous with us,\u201d the superintendent said. \u201cI\u2019ve been elated with it.\u201dEven before Katrina made landfall nearby, the Plaquemines jail did not come close to filling its more than 800 beds. The average population was 395 in 2004 and 274 in 2003, according to reports obtained through an open records request. But that did not stop the sheriff at the time, Irvin F. Hingle Jr., known as Jiff, from insisting that the jail be rebuilt at the same capacity on the same site.John Connolly, a senior public assistance adviser in FEMA\u2019s Louisiana Recovery Office, tried to persuade Mr. Hingle to make the jail smaller and move it to higher, more accessible ground. \u201cThey were not receptive to that and largely that was the end of it, sadly,\u201d Mr. Connolly recalled. \u201cWe really did not have the leverage to insist on it.\u201dBecause the jail site sits in a flood zone, FEMA could require that the 207,000-square-foot building be built atop columns, but not that it be moved, explained Thomas M. Womack, the director of the recovery office. \u201cThat\u2019s just what our regulation and policy call for,\u201d he said.Those who knew and worked with him, including his successors and other parish officials, said Mr. Hingle had hoped to revive the devastated economy on the east bank, his political base. Additionally, they said, the sheriff viewed the jail as a profit center that supported his other operations and thus expanded patronage.Essential to his success was his ability to win contracts with federal agencies that paid top rates to house their detainees. Mr. Hingle had a deal with the Department of Homeland Security to hold up to 220 immigration and customs detainees at a daily rate of $47.19 per inmate, records show. That is almost double the paltry $24.39 paid by the state and parish.Things changed after Katrina forced the jail\u2019s evacuation. The federal agency now opts not to house inmates in Plaquemines, or anywhere else south of Lake Pontchartrain, said Bryan D. Cox, a spokesman for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.The state corrections system, which uses local jails to relieve crowding, nonetheless remains the Plaquemines jail\u2019s primary supplier. The current sheriff, Gerald A. Turlich Jr., also secured a contract with the United States Marshals Service. While the jail\u2019s average monthly census grew to 548 in the second quarter from fewer than 100 when it opened in 2015, only one in seven are there on local charges.\u201cTwo hundred beds would have been fine, and you would have saved a lot of federal taxpayer dollars,\u201d said Lonnie Greco, who won the sheriff\u2019s job after Mr. Hingle\u2019s indictment (and then lost it to Sheriff Turlich). \u201cAt one time it was a thing to build big prisons to make money, but that time is gone.\u201dThe detention center is not so elevated that it would necessarily stay dry in another Katrina. But it was built of thick precast concrete to withstand a major storm, with backup generators and raised water tanks and circuitry, along with basketball courts, roomy living pods, more than 600 security cameras, biometric entrance scanners and video screens that inmates can use to talk to family members via Skype.\u201cIt seemed an awfully expensive choice,\u201d he said.Sheriff Turlich said that when he took over in 2016, the maintenance and operation of the all-but-empty jail was draining $2 million from the department\u2019s $25 million budget. To help bring it into balance, he raised property tax rates by 8 percent.Agustin Armendariz contributed research.Follow Kevin Sack and John Schwartz on Twitter: @ksacknyt and @jswatz.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Italy\u2019s Debt Rating Is Cut to One Level Above Junk", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe rating on Italy\u2019s debt was slashed on Friday by Moody\u2019s Investors Service to one level above junk in a reaction to the Italian government\u2019s decision to accept higher budget deficits in coming years.Moody\u2019s also highlighted the fact that higher deficits would keep Italy\u2019s debt at its current high levels of 130 percent of the overall economy.Italy\u2019s populist government wants to increase expenditures in a bid to stimulate a dormant economy, despite European Union rules that require all members to reduce budget deficits.For months now, global investors have fretted that Italy\u2019s new government would challenge European economic orthodoxy, leading to a potential exit from the euro.The war of words between Rome and European leaders in Brussels and Frankfurt, where the European Central Bank is based, has increased in recent weeks, prompting a prolonged sell-off in Italian 10-year bonds.Yields of these bonds \u2014 which move in the opposite direction of their price \u2014 have more than doubled since May to 3.5 percent. Italian bond yields are approaching the 5 to 7 percent levels of 2012, the depth of the European Union debt crisis.The brinkmanship between Italy and the rest of Europe is feeding worries that the eurozone might experience another debt crisis, similar to what happened when Greece could no longer sell its bonds to investors and was bailed out by the International Monetary Fund.However, the Italian economy is 15 percent of the total eurozone economy, compared with Greece\u2019s 2 percent. And a blowup in Italy, one of the most indebted countries in the world, would not only rattle Europe but spread throughout global markets.\u201cItaly has the ability to change the direction of global markets,\u201d said Julian Brigden of Macro Intelligence 2 Partners, an independent research company in Vail, Colo., in a research note on Friday.The rating on Italy\u2019s debt is Moody\u2019s lowest before a bond is considered junk. But Moody\u2019s pointed out in its note that Italy had advantages, including a large, diversified economy and a trading surplus with other countries. For these reasons, Moody\u2019s said, the broader outlook for the country remains stable.The Moody\u2019s downgrade is not likely to be the only one, because rating agencies tend to move in unison. And unless the authorities in Rome decide to reverse course, the debt controversy will continue for some time.The Italian debt standoff is occurring at a jittery time for global investors. The United States stock market, by far the best-performing large-equity market in the world over the past year, has been in a rut, with investors uncertain about corporate earnings, rising interest rates, a trade war with China and global growth.European markets have been under pressure because of fears of slowing growth and worries over the health of the region\u2019s largest banks \u2014 especially those in Italy. Italian banks are among the largest holders of Italian bonds. So the more the bonds fall in value, the worse it is for the large banks.Shares of UniCredit, the largest bank in Italy, have fallen 26 percent this year.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With $30 Million, Obscure Democratic Group Floods the Zone in House Races", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRADENTON BEACH, Fla. \u2014 The billboard flickered from the side of a truck, displaying an image of Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida, wearing a yachtsman\u2019s cap. Keith Fitzgerald, a local dignitary invited by the group Floridians for a Fair Shake, stood before it as he tore into the lawmaker\u2019s record.Floridians for a Fair Shake has criticized Mr. Buchanan for months, with paid advertising, campaign workers, and events like this, on a recent Sunday in a beachside parking lot. Yet Mr. Fitzgerald, a former Democratic state legislator and something of the guest of honor, confessed, \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know a whole lot about this group.\u201d\u201cThey told me what they were doing,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where the money comes from.\u201dA structure unknown even to some of those involved, Floridians for a Fair Shake and 13 other groups around the country are funded and coordinated out of a single office in Washington, with the goal of battering Republicans for their health care and economic policies during the midterm elections.At the center of the effort is an opaquely named Democratic organization, the Hub Project, which is on track to spend nearly $30 million since 2017 pressuring members of Congress in their districts. The great bulk of its funding has come from so-called dark money \u2014 funds from donors who are not legally required to reveal their names.With that money, the Hub Project \u2014 in an initiative run by a former Obama administration official and public relations specialist, Leslie Dach, and Arkadi Gerney, a former political strategist for the liberal Center for American Progress \u2014 set up an array of affiliate groups around the country, many with vaguely sympathetic names like Keep Iowa Healthy, New Jersey for a Better Future and North Carolinians for a Fair Economy. The Hub Project then used them to mobilize volunteers and run advertising on policy issues against Republican members of Congress many months before the election.While some of its visible activities during the midterms have been previously reported, the Hub Project has never before disclosed the scale of its efforts or discussed them extensively on the record.Mr. Gerney, the group\u2019s executive director, said in an interview that the initiative targeting several dozen congressional districts had been designed to keep the focus on the Republicans\u2019 legislative agenda in an election heavily dominated by President Trump\u2019s personality. He described it as a test case for a larger theory of Democratic politics, defined by continuous attacks on Republican policies rather than on Mr. Trump.\u201cIt\u2019s a very chaotic media environment and, understandably, lots of people are chasing Trump\u2019s Twitter feed,\u201d Mr. Gerney said. \u201cBut for most people, their health care, their family finances, their economic future \u2014 these things really matter.\u201dMr. Gerney displayed no ambivalence about using undisclosed contributions \u2014 traditionally a source of dismay for Democrats \u2014 to punish Republicans for last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax law and their attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in unilateral disarmament,\u201d Mr. Gerney said.Mr. Gerney and others involved in the effort described it unfolding in stages, first targeting five congressional districts in the summer of 2017, then expanding to a map of 19 seats over the next 11 months. In some districts, the Hub Project\u2019s state affiliates were running paid advertising months before other outside groups got involved \u2014 and before members of Congress mobilized to defend themselves.A former senior official with the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Jessica Floyd, has overseen the advertising.Polling conducted for the Hub Project, and scrutinized by a pair of Stanford University researchers in an analysis shared with The New York Times, found that voters in districts where its affiliates operated were likelier to remember their representative\u2019s votes on health care and taxes, though in some cases ad campaigns also appeared to generate backlashes among Republicans.In North Carolina\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, the affiliate group North Carolinians for a Fair Economy spent about $736,000 criticizing Mr. Holding, a third-term lawmaker in a conservative-leaning district, and pressuring the Republican in television ads to \u201cstop raising the cost of health care.\u201d Carter Wrenn, a political adviser for Mr. Holding, said the attack had come as something of an ambush and forced Mr. Holding to scramble to air an ad defending his record.\u201cThey made the first big attack on George,\u201d said Mr. Wrenn, adding that he had sought unsuccessfully to discern who was behind the attack: \u201cWe tried to figure out who they were, but there\u2019s not much you can tell about who funds them and who they are, exactly.\u201dMr. Holding is battling for re-election against his Democratic challenger, Linda Coleman.Mr. Gerney confirmed that the Hub Project controls the money flowing from the Sixteen Thirty Fund into the state-level groups, but the larger nonprofit does not have to disclose its funding sources.Mr. Gerney also confirmed that the Hub Project controls a super PAC of its own, Change Now, which has been funding advertising this fall against a smaller list of Republican-held districts that includes some of the same targets. The group has filed a report with the Federal Election Commission showing it received $1.75 million in funding from the League of Conservation Voters, the influential environmental group, and several people involved with the effort said future reports were expected to show contributions from national labor unions.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.\u201cThey really dislike dark money and any type of political spending,\u201d Ms. Muller said of voters. At the same time, she noted, research suggests \u201cvoters trust outside-group ads more than they trust candidate ads.\u201dMr. Dach said that the network of state groups had bolstered the Hub Project\u2019s credibility with voters, connecting it with local activists who in some cases ended up starring in ads. Mr. Dach, a former Obama administration health care official, said the 14-month advocacy campaign had helped keep policy at the forefront of the midterm election.Mr. Dach and Mr. Gerney both said they decided to go on the record with the details of the campaign because they hoped Democrats would adopt it for future election cycles. In the past, Mr. Dach said, Democrats had lacked the funds and focus to sustain an argument on core issues like health care.\u201cThese issues are clear, they\u2019re understandable to people, but I think we neglected and we were financially unable to sustain this kind of work before,\u201d Mr. Dach said. \u201cWe have been on the same message \u2014 pre-existing conditions, age tax, health care costs, sabotage \u2014 from day one.\u201dThe event in Bradenton Beach taunting Mr. Buchanan was emblematic of the group\u2019s approach \u2014 and its limitations. Democrats had been hopeful of flipping the conservative-leaning district, anchored in the comfortable and predominantly white suburbs on the south end of Tampa Bay. A prominent local trial lawyer, David Shapiro, jumped in as the Democratic candidate and the race intensified after a Hub Project researcher discovered Mr. Buchanan\u2019s yacht purchase.Yet as voters on the right have grown more energized about the midterm elections, Mr. Buchanan has appeared somewhat more secure in his re-election prospects. As Mr. Fitzgerald assailed the Republican\u2019s voting record, flanked by an activist dressed as a yacht captain, Vince Cavell looked on skeptically from a short distance.Mr. Cavell, 66, who retired to the area after a career in the computer business, shrugged at the attacks on Mr. Buchanan\u2019s support for the tax law.\u201cI\u2019m enjoying the lower taxes,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

That is a monumental shift for a country where small family farms have dominated the rural landscape for centuries.It may sound tragic, as a traditional way of life gives way to modernization, much like the disappearance of the small American family farm. But the transformation is good for China and the entire global economy.Bigger farms become more efficient. Those farmers can make more money. And more people are free to move to the city, creating even more consumers for Ford cars, Starbucks cappuccinos and Apple iPhones. \u201cIf everybody farmed, then everybody wouldn\u2019t have that much land,\u201d said Zheng Yunshou, a 51-year-old Shanhui farmer. \u201cBut if one household out of 10 does all the farming, then they can make enough for themselves, and the other nine can also make enough by working elsewhere.\u201dHis son still lives at home, but he prefers his job operating an excavator at construction sites to toiling at his father\u2019s cornfield. Mr. Zheng\u2019s daughter has left for a far-off city, where she \u201cdoes something with computers,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not sad about it,\u201d he added. \u201cThe farm will not be sufficient to support my son.\u201d The result is a thriving business cultivating corn and carrots. Mr. Zheng invested in planters, pesticide sprayers and other equipment, including a new, shiny red harvester, parked in a lot behind his modest home. Piles of corn are stored in a warehouse next door. During autumn, he employs over 100 people from about 10 villages to harvest his carrots.By farming on such scale, Mr. Zheng can make money smaller farmers can only dream about \u2014 roughly $80,000 a year. Much of it is reinvested in more land and equipment.\u201cIn 10 years\u2019 time, a lot of land will be rented to big farmers like me,\u201d Mr. Zheng said.That opportunity has drawn others. Over the past 10 years, Zhang Mianhuan, 59, has increased the size of his farm 10 times, to more than 30 acres, on which he grows corn and sorghum. On his old, small plot, he pocketed a measly $300 a year \u2014 barely enough to get by. Now, he earns about $9,000. \u201cFarmers think, \u2018The more land the better,\u2019\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \u201cIt means more income.\u201d The seismic shifts in rural China could threaten community spirit. One afternoon in Shanhui, the farmers congregated in a central square, chatting under the shade cast by awnings and a traditional wooden pavilion. A few hours earlier, many had celebrated the wedding of a young local woman, feasting on roast lamb, fried chicken and local tofu, and toasting one another with plastic cups filled with baijiu, a favorite, sinus-clearing alcohol. (Typically, the bride will leave the village to join her new husband in a nearby town.)The changes separate families. Zheng Chengsheng, 66, had to stop farming two years ago after he was badly injured in a motorbike accident. Now he rents out his family plot, allowing him to support himself and his wife. His three children all work in cities. His daughters make it back to Shanhui only during the Chinese New Year holiday, while his son lives in a nearby town.\u201cI would prefer my son to come back. Then he can be by my side,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife and I are concerned that we\u2019ll be by ourselves when we\u2019re older. It is a common worry here.\u201dIn some villages, farms are getting larger and the population is dwindling at an even faster pace than in Shanhui. But that does not necessarily mean China\u2019s village will completely die out. China\u2019s population is so large that hundreds of millions of people will most likely remain in the countryside even as cities swell. That means many areas of China may not develop the sort of supersize industrial farming common to places like America\u2019s Midwest.\u201cChina\u2019s situation is completely different and cannot follow the U.S. model,\u201d said Li Ping, a senior attorney at Landesa, a nongovernmental organization that helps secure land rights for the world\u2019s poor. \u201cVillage size will be somewhat shrunk, but the village will still be there.\u201dThe residents of Shanhui think so, too. Though they assume the population will shrink, they remain convinced the village will become wealthier. \u201cEverything will just get better,\u201d said Zheng Nanda, the retired farmer, a typical sentiment shared by the villagers. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to worry about anything.\u201dWhatever the future holds for Shanhui, many villagers feel little nostalgia for their poorer past. As the sun sets and the air cools, Wang Yulin, 61, tends to his fresh corn seedlings in a field on Shanhui\u2019s outskirts, as he has done for decades. But with his three children off working in cities, he realizes that one day, he will probably have to give up his farm.He greets the prospect with a shrug. \u201cYou can\u2019t make much money farming,\u201d he said.Zhang Tiantian contributed research.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misidentified a man standing next to a pile of corn. It was a farmer, but not Zhang Mianhuan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Teacher Walkouts, Arizona Republicans Jostle Onto Education Platform", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX \u2014 Campaign signs are clustered on street corners and highway ramps across this low-slung, sun-baked city, proclaiming \u201c#YesforEd\u201d and \u201cProtect Public Education.\u201d In TV commercials, the Republican governor promises to \u201cput more money in the classroom, not bureaucracy.\u201d \u201cOur schools are falling apart,\u201d his Democratic challenger counters.The teachers\u2019 protest movement, which calls itself #RedforEd, has transformed the political battleground. The movement remains so popular in Arizona that candidates and causes across the ideological spectrum are competing to identify with it \u2014 including conservatives who, in years past, might have been more likely to criticize teachers or unions than associate with activist educators.That has left some Democrats \u2014 teachers\u2019 traditional allies \u2014 scrambling to differentiate themselves.It is a pattern that has played out in several states where teachers have walked off the job this year, including Oklahoma, West Virginia and Kentucky. The teachers\u2019 movement has energized Democrats in red states, with record numbers of educators running for office. But it may have had an even greater impact on Republican politics. In primaries, it has picked off Republican legislators who opposed funding for teachers and schools. And it has convinced conservative leaders that voters, particularly suburban parents, are looking for full-throated support, and open pocketbooks, for public education.In Arizona, which has some of the lowest school funding in the nation, nowhere are these issues more prominent than in the governor\u2019s race. Both candidates have claimed the mantle of education champion.\u201cI\u2019m the one who\u2019s been on the side of the teacher,\u201d Gov. Doug Ducey, the Republican incumbent, said in an interview at his campaign headquarters last week.The governor, the former chief executive of the ice cream franchise Cold Stone Creamery, argues that a growing economy will ensure that schools funding and teacher pay will continue to rise. He also says that if re-elected, he will seek to cut taxes \u2014 a pledge that leaves some educators skeptical they will see all the funding they have been promised.Mr. Ducey\u2019s challenger, David Garcia, a professor of education at Arizona State University, has a radically different vision.Mr. Garcia says that if he is elected, he will push to close corporate tax loopholes, end tax credits for private school tuition and revisit the effort to raise taxes on the wealthy, perhaps through a new ballot initiative.But Mr. Garcia is betting that concern about public education among women, younger voters and Latinos \u2014 including many who are newly registered, or do not typically turn out for midterm elections \u2014 can carry him. He says those voters are not being reached by pollsters, who have him trailing Mr. Ducey.\u201cYou see new people, new energy, new enthusiasm,\u201d Mr. Garcia said over lunch at a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix. \u201cThey\u2019re not out there to vote for the same old politics.\u201dMr. Garcia is an unusual candidate in Arizona. He is an Army veteran with a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago and an expert on the huge troves of data that have transformed education research over the past two decades.He used some of that data to create the state\u2019s first school rating and accountability systems when he worked for the state Education Department in the late 1990s and early 2000s. In that role, he sometimes butted heads with teachers\u2019 union leaders, who at the time were skeptical of using student data to judge schools, he said.Nevertheless, the state\u2019s largest teachers\u2019 union, the Arizona Education Association, has enthusiastically endorsed him this year.Mr. Garcia sometimes sounds more like Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont than the centrist Democrats more typical in Arizona, like Kyrsten Sinema, the Senate candidate, who has not endorsed him.In addressing the other big issue roiling the state \u2014 immigration \u2014 Mr. Garcia has called to \u201creplace ICE\u201d with an immigration enforcement system \u201cconsistent with our American values.\u201d The Ducey campaign and its surrogates quickly reframed Mr. Garcia\u2019s position as \u201cabolish ICE.\u201dMr. Ducey believes his opponent has misjudged an electorate that remains fundamentally conservative.\u201cFor a fourth-generation Arizonan, he doesn\u2019t seem to know the state of Arizona very well,\u201d the governor said.Swing voters are paying close attention. Katy O\u2019Connor, an art teacher wearing her #RedforEd T-shirt, went door to door in an upper-middle class neighborhood in Phoenix last week, campaigning for the Democratic ticket. She spoke with Curtis Miller, 57, who described himself as an undecided \u201cliberal Republican.\u201dMr. Miller said he was sympathetic to teachers and willing to pay higher taxes if the money was spent efficiently on education. But he was concerned, he said, about illegal immigration, and leaning toward voting for Mr. Ducey.\u201cWe don\u2019t have the money to support everybody,\u201d Mr. Miller said.Ms. O\u2019Connor said that even if Mr. Miller would not support Mr. Garcia, she hoped he would vote for other education priorities down the ballot. Democrats have a shot at flipping control of the State Senate, and there is a fierce contest for state schools superintendent.Then there is Proposition 305, a ballot initiative that, if passed, would expand access to educational savings accounts, a voucherlike system that provides tax dollars for private school tuition.The campaign to approve it has produced red posters and a slogan, #YesForEd, seemingly intended to ride the popularity of #RedforEd while standing at odds with most of its activists.Even campaigns that have little to do with schools are trying to align with the teachers\u2019 movement. The electricity industry opposes a ballot initiative that would require utilities to draw some of their energy from renewable sources. Their yard signs declare: \u201cHigher Electric Bills Hurts AZ Schools.\u201dDespite the diversity of causes and candidates elbowing for the education platform, the differences between the Republican and Democratic visions remain stark. Mr. Ducey sees education in Arizona as a competitive marketplace. He supports sending more tax dollars to private and religious schools and increasing the number of public charter schools. \u201cParents are good consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey know what\u2019s best for their child.\u201dMr. Garcia wrote his dissertation on Arizona charter schools, and has continued to research them. When asked about the subject, he grabbed a notebook and pen out of a reporter\u2019s hands and drew a graph in the shape of a \u201cU.\u201d Most charter schools in Arizona, he said, are either excellent, like the one his older daughter attends, or low-performing. Few are average.Mr. Garcia said he supported school choice, but only within the public system. He opposes spending taxpayer dollars on private school tuition, which he says leeches funding from public education. When he was growing up in Mesa, outside Phoenix, his own parents, a factory worker and commercial painter, chose to send him to an elementary school outside his neighborhood that was better than the local school.\u201cThe Legislature and the governor believe that only those who have left traditional public schools are making a choice,\u201d Mr. Garcia said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s not true. Hundreds of thousands of parents are making a choice to be in a traditional public school. And we need to honor that choice.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Cuomo to Debate Republican Foe After Week of Barbs and Chicken Insults", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byGov. Andrew M. Cuomo and his Republican opponent, Marcus J. Molinaro, have agreed to a televised debate on Tuesday, after more than a week of wrangling, dodging and barbs over who was more afraid to face the other.The debate would be Mr. Cuomo\u2019s first one-on-one face-off with his general election opponent for governor; in previous years, he has participated in debates with his Republican challenger as well as other minor-party candidates.Mr. Molinaro rejected that proposal, calling for more notice for voters and a televised meeting. A weekend of continued rhetorical missiles ensued, with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s team now being the one to accuse Mr. Molinaro of hiding from a debate.Finally, on Sunday, Mr. Cuomo offered a televised debate for Tuesday. Mr. Molinaro accepted on Monday.\u201cThe voters of New York won an important victory last night,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said during a news conference.Mr. Cuomo\u2019s team called the acceptance overdue. \u201cAfter days of ducking the debate, we\u2019re glad Marc Molinaro has finally agreed,\u201d Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for the Cuomo campaign, said on Monday. \u201cSee you tomorrow.\u201dAs with Mr. Cuomo\u2019s debate against his primary election opponent, Cynthia Nixon, there will be no opening or closing statements; both candidates will be seated; Marcia Kramer, from WCBS, will be one of the moderators; and the debate will be taped beforehand, to be broadcast later in the day.But Mr. Molinaro brushed off questions about whether he would be at a disadvantage during the debate, or how he would prepare for a one-on-one encounter that had come together on such short notice.\u201cI\u2019ll be spending some time with my kids,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said, adding that he had been preparing for the debate \u201csince the day\u201d he announced his campaign.Mr. Cuomo spent the day before the debate in New York City and on Long Island, attending the Nassau County Democratic Committee\u2019s fall dinner; his aides declined to say how he would prepare for the debate. Mr. Molinaro held a news conference on developmental disabilities and met with city voters.The debate will likely be Mr. Molinaro\u2019s biggest platform yet to attack the governor on public corruption, the upstate economy and the breakdown of the city\u2019s subway system, three topics Mr. Molinaro has made central to his campaign. (Mr. Molinaro on Monday also called for two more debates upstate, a challenge Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign has not addressed.)Mr. Molinaro also plans to play up his underdog story, emphasizing his personal biography \u2014 he has repeatedly said he grew up in a family that relied on food stamps \u2014 and contrast it with the governor\u2019s, in an attempt to cast Mr. Cuomo as the scion of a political dynasty, according to a person with knowledge of Mr. Molinaro\u2019s plans.\u201cThis is a big opportunity for me to present myself,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said on Monday.Still, barring a major slip-up from Mr. Cuomo, it seems unlikely that one hour on television, right before Game 1 of the World Series, would turn the tide for Mr. Molinaro. But it is precisely the possibility of those slip-ups in an unscripted, unpredictable debate that has made Mr. Cuomo \u2014 a micromanager by temperament \u2014 almost congenitally wary of such matchups, according to a person familiar with the governor\u2019s thinking.Mr. Molinaro seemed to acknowledge that had stood to gain far more from the debate than Mr. Cuomo did. \u201cWe have what we asked for,\u201d he said.The governor, for his part, has often invoked the urgency of the \u201cblue wave\u201d nationwide, and he may use the debate to tar Mr. Molinaro as a \u201cmini-me\u201d of President Trump who has been weak on women\u2019s rights, gun safety and white supremacists. That message is hardly new to the airwaves, though: Mr. Cuomo\u2019s campaign has spent more than $1.75 million on television ads since the primary election in September, according to campaign finance filings. Mr. Molinaro\u2019s has spent $100,000.At the same time, Mr. Cuomo has also tried to broadcast a wider message, perhaps to an audience beyond New York, that the backlash to Mr. Trump would be seen in a \u201cred, white and blue wave,\u201d and that the administration\u2019s policies were not merely anti-New York, but \u201canti-American.\u201dThe debate is set to air on tape delay at 7 p.m. on television and radio by WCBS, and shared with local affiliates around the state. The moderators will be Ms. Kramer, a longtime TV reporter for the station, and Rich Lamb from the station\u2019s radio affiliate.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Infosys Built Its Global Machine With Indian Workers. Can It Adjust to Trump\u2019s \u2018Hire American\u2019?", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhen Infosys, a big Indian technology outsourcing company, opened a new office in Indianapolis this year, executives hailed it as a step along a new path.Infosys built itself into a global giant by running the digital engine rooms of American corporations with armies of engineers in India. But the new technology center \u2014 a sprawling open-plan space in a downtown office tower \u2014 is in the epicenter of the American Midwest.And its recruits are people like Keith Smith Jr., a graduate of Indiana University, who previously held a variety of jobs before Infosys trained him as a software engineer.Ravi Kumar, a president of Infosys, described the office as \u201ca manifestation of what the future is going to look like.\u201dThe company, a shining success story in the Indian economy, is under mounting pressure to hire more Americans and do significantly more work onshore, in what would be a striking overhaul of its corporate culture and its business practices. In the process, Infosys has become a case study of how market forces and immigration changes by the Trump administration are reshaping corporations.Policy changes from the Trump administration may be even more threatening. As part of his efforts to curb the flow of foreign workers into the United States, President Trump called for tighter controls on skilled worker visas in his \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d executive order last year.Traditionally, Indian outsourcers like Infosys have deftly exploited the skilled-worker visa system. The majority of its employees in the United States hold one of those visas, analysts estimate. The company has also been fined by the government for abusing visa rules in the past, and its practices continue to draw the scrutiny of federal investigators.All the steps Infosys is now taking \u201cwould be a huge change,\u201d said Rod Bourgeois, an expert on the industry and the head of research at Deep Dive Equity Research. \u201cIt\u2019s not in their DNA.\u201dOther big offshore outsourcing companies are also responding to the market and political threats, including Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro and Cognizant. But Infosys made the biggest, most public commitment to building up its work force in the United States, when the company declared last year that it would hire 10,000 workers in America by sometime in 2019.Then, Infosys began to announce the creation of tech centers in America. Indianapolis was the first, followed by offices in Raleigh, N.C.; Providence, R.I.; and Hartford. Last month, the company said its next hub would be in Arizona. Infosys says it has hired more than 5,800 American workers.\u201cWe will be looking for talent that is closer to our client clusters,\u201d said Mr. Kumar, who is the point man in the company\u2019s initiative to hire American workers. \u201cAnd our operating model will evolve.\u201dFor now, though, an estimated 80 percent of the 200,000 Infosys workers are in India, a market that accounts for 3 percent of its worldwide revenue of $11 billion last year. The company garners 60 percent of its revenue in North America, mainly in the United States, where Infosys employs more than 20,000 workers, analysts estimate. About two-thirds of the Infosys workers in America, they say, have been Indians with skilled-worker visas.The main such visa program, H-1B, was intended to bring in talented foreigners with special skills who would complement the domestic work force and strengthen the United States economy.But critics say the Indian outsourcers mastered the use of legal loopholes to obtain an outsize share of skilled-worker visas, which, in turn, allowed the companies to hire less costly Indian workers.The government continues to monitor the company. One current and two former Infosys employees, who spoke on the condition that they not be identified, said federal investigators had questioned them in recent months about the company\u2019s visa handling.The Justice Department and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services did not respond to requests for comment.Infosys also faces two private, civil lawsuits accusing the company of discrimination in hiring, promotions and firing.The accounts from testimony and interviews with witnesses tied to those suits vary in detail. But the stories share themes that illustrate how hard it could be for Infosys to change its ways.The plaintiffs and witnesses were experienced lawyers, human relations managers, salespeople and engineers who joined Infosys as the company expanded rapidly in the United States. Things went smoothly at first, when the newcomers brought in new customers or smoothed the way with government agencies.But tensions surfaced. Important decisions were all made in India. Questions were unwelcome. Complaints brought retaliation \u2014 reassignments, demotions, abrupt firings and belittling remarks.\u201cIt\u2019s basically a corporate caste system, run out of India,\u201d said Erin Green, a former immigration lawyer for Infosys, who filed one of the civil suits against the company in Texas last year. \u201cAnd people who are not Indian are at the bottom.\u201dDaniel Kotchen, a lawyer who has a pending suit against the company in Wisconsin on behalf of former workers, said, \u201cInfosys has a business model that is discriminatory \u2014 its rigid and explicit preference for a certain kind of person.\u201dInfosys is fighting the suits, denying discrimination and saying its work force reflects the global labor pool for technology skills.\u201cEmployment at our company,\u201d Infosys said in a statement, \u201cis decided on the basis of qualifications, merit and the needs of our clients.\u201dEven as Infosys increases hiring in America, its lower-paid engineers back in India still animate the business. Wage rates in India have risen in recent years, but the gap is still sizable \u2014 a third or a fourth the rates in the United States.Programming work done in India, analysts estimate, is twice as profitable as writing code in America. On a typical project, 70 percent or more of the work is done in India.The Indian employees working at United States companies are often there mainly to understand customer needs and communicate with the large teams back in India. They are vital to the Infosys business, but are a fraction of the company\u2019s engineering work force.That formula \u2014 the so-called global delivery model \u2014 has been embraced by non-Indian companies, like IBM and Accenture, for parts of their business. But it has been the prime engine of business for Infosys.\u201cIt may be changing some, but Infosys is certainly not abandoning its cash-cow business model,\u201d said Ronil Hira, an offshore outsourcing expert at Howard University.In India, Infosys is a hiring and training machine. Its pitch in the United States is that it is transplanting a version of that model here, no matter the higher costs. \u201cWe\u2019re going to create pools of talent that do not exist in the United States,\u201d Mr. Kumar said, and \u201cstrengthen the American work force.\u201dThe message is appealing to state governors, winning Infosys praise and tax breaks. In Indiana, Infosys says it plans to hire 3,000 workers by 2023, after a recent announcement that it would build a training center on a 70-acre site near the Indianapolis airport.Gov. Eric Holcomb, a Republican, describes the Infosys presence as an important building block for his state\u2019s economic development \u2014 and well worth a generous incentive package of tax credits and training grants.Governor Holcomb shrugs off critics who claim that Infosys undercuts American workers. \u201cThey\u2019re hiring here,\u201d he said.Mr. Smith, the recent recruit who was hired last October, spent his first two months in an intensive training program, honing his skills in several programming languages and developer tools. Before Infosys, he held jobs in marketing, video production and work-force recruiting, and completed a four-month course at a coding boot camp. His current Infosys assignment is helping a large telecom company on web projects.Mr. Smith, 35, views his Infosys job as an on-ramp to the digital economy. \u201cI see limitless potential,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

He was 86.His death was confirmed by his son Piet.Mr. Botha was a busy figure on the world diplomatic scene as foreign minister from the late 1970s through the \u201980s, a time of deepening unrest in South Africa, when the government crackdown on protests to white rule was growing increasingly violent.It was also a time of rising international pressure against the racist regime. Mr. Botha fought the imposition of Western sanctions on his country.A bluff, plain-spoken man popular with the white electorate and a jocular off-the-record drinking companion of journalists, Mr. Botha at times showed a moderate streak rarely found among his hard-line party fellows.In 1970, during his first address to Parliament as a member, he urged the government to subscribe to the United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights, a move that had been strongly resisted.In 1974, while serving as South Africa\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, he stated that discrimination on the basis of skin color \u2014 the foundation of apartheid rule \u2014 was indefensible.And in 1986, with the end of apartheid approaching, he said at a press briefing, \u201cIt would possibly become unavoidable that in the future you might have a black president of this country,\u201d as long as minority rights were guaranteed.

Botha (no relation), forced him to retract the statement.Mr. Botha was \u201cone of the few\u201d from his party \u201cwho recognized at an early stage that apartheid was a wrong and crime against humanity,\u201d the A.N.C. said in a statement after his death.Mr. Botha declared his support for the African National Congress in 2000.\u201cAfrikaners, whites should support the A.N.C.,\u201d he said in interviews. \u201cWe cannot just continue with blacks voting A.N.C. and whites voting for the opposition. I want to break with the racist attitudes of the past.\u201d Some news reports said he had actually joined the A.N.C., but he denied this years later.Roelof Frederik Botha was born on April 27, 1932, in Rustenburg, about 80 miles west of Pretoria. His father, also named Roelof Frederik, was a schoolteacher; his mother, Maria Elizabeth (Dreyer) Botha, was a homemaker.Mr. Botha was educated in Potchefstroom, to the south and closer to Johannesburg, and received a law degree from the University of Pretoria.His nickname, Pik, is short for pikkewyn, Afrikaans for penguin. He acquired it later on, some thought, because of his resemblance to that bird when he wore a suit.Mr. Botha joined the foreign service and served in Sweden and West Germany. In 1963 he helped defend South Africa in a case brought by Liberia and Ethiopia against it in the International Court of Justice at The Hague, challenging its administration of South West Africa, which later became Namibia. The case was dismissed.In 1975 he was appointed ambassador to the United States while also serving as permanent representative to the United Nations.As foreign minister, Mr. Botha was involved in the talks that led to Zimbabwe\u2019s independence in 1980, and talks that preceded Namibia\u2019s independence a decade later. He negotiated a delicate peace accord between South Africa and Mozambique in 1984.In addition to his son Piet, Mr. Botha\u2019s survivors include his wife, Ina; another son, Roelof; two daughters, Anna Hertzog and Lien Botha; and a number of grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His first wife, Helena Bosman, died in 1996.Toward the end of his life, Mr. Botha paid tribute to Nelson Mandela and the goal of racial coexistence.Speaking of Mr. Mandela, he said, \u201cI so often experience his capacity to forgive, and then his will to improve the country, its systems, the poor black people, uplift them but without damaging the economy.\u201dHe added, \u201cBlack and white in this country need each other to succeed.\u201dAn earlier version of this obituary misspelled Mr. Botha\u2019s middle name. His full name was Roelof Frederik Botha, not Frederick.Kimon de Greef contributed reporting from Cape Town.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philipsburg, Montana, 11:57 A.M.", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "Documenting moments across the country, large and small, quiet and indelible.Supported byWhen this project was being conceived, a storm named Florence did not exist. It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L. Whitfield sermonized from the Gospel According to John. In one of the pews they built a dollhouse out of Bibles. Pastor Whitfield was baptized in the bayou that runs behind the church 54 years ago. Now he was leading the small congregation, sweat beading on his brow.Sunday at noon in the United States. Two girls and their dolls, salvation and stories in the air.

Stark, the little boy, stared out at all of this, a child of the desert in dank, humid air, and then he looked up at his father and said that when he grew up he was going to play professional soccer in Italy, and then he was going to come back to Florida and be a fishing guide.We set out to document 24 different hours in 24 states, to shine a lens on the lives of people rarely in the headlines.

Whitfield, 69, was baptized in the 15-mile bayou that runs behind True Vine Missionary Baptist Church in 1964, but it took him 35 years to get back to this place where he was first made in the spirit. In the intervening time, he came of age, worked as a contractor, had daughters and sons, built two churches with his own hands and led them, and saw his sons join the ministry and lead their own congregations in other Delta towns.His return to his spiritual birthplace was not a matter of if, but rather when \u2014 18 years ago this month.

{"Headline": "Donald Trump Versus the Jungle", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president\u2019s fantasy is that the U.S. can ignore the global forces of nature.Opinion ColumnistWhen Donald Trump spoke at the United Nations on Sept. 25 and provoked guffaws from the diplomats in the audience for his boasting, Trump insisted that they were not laughing at him, they were laughing with him. I wasn\u2019t there so I can\u2019t say what they were actually doing on the outside. But on the inside, I\u2019m pretty sure I know: They were crying.They were crying over the fact that the America they had come to know and respect over the last 70 years \u2014 and whose generosity and security order they had come to rely upon and even take advantage of at times \u2014 had left the building.It had been replaced by Trump\u2019s America, which is different in two fundamental ways. First, Trump\u2019s America does not see itself as the galvanizer and protector of the liberal global order that brought more peace, prosperity and democracy to more corners of the world over the last 70 years than at any time in history \u2014 defying the natural order of things, which is constant jungle-like conflict, protectionism and strongman rule.Second, Trump\u2019s America is unafraid to engage in the raw exercise of power against any foe or friend to gain economic or geopolitical advantage \u2014 no matter how big or small \u2014 and, at the same time, is ready to overlook any human rights abuse or killing by any country deemed friendly to Trump personally or not interesting to him geopolitically.It all depends just how far Trump goes with this. Will it be a mild departure from the approach of every other U.S. president of the postwar era \u2014 each of whom understood that we had an overall interest in being the overall steward of a democratizing global order \u2014 or a radical departure? I don\u2019t know yet, but if you look around, a lot of people are acting as if the cat\u2019s away so the mice can play.Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has felt quite confident about poisoning ex-spies living in Britain. And how about that Russian investigative journalist who just happened to jump out a window? And how about China arresting the head of the global policing organization, Interpol, Meng Hongwei, a Chinese citizen, when he was home for a visit? He is now being investigated for corruption.The key pillars of this liberal world order, Kagan argued, were the conversion of Germany and Japan from aggressive dictatorships to pacifist democracies, the building of a global trading regime and the backing of it all with certain made-in-America norms and rules of commerce and geopolitics, buttressed by the U.S. Navy, Air Force and Army.\u201cWe did not do all of this out of an abundance of generosity, or the post-World War II statesmen saying, \u2018Gosh, how do we make the world a better place?\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cIt actually came from them saying: \u2018How do we prevent the world backsliding into the kind of world war we just survived?\u2019\u201d This was not charity for them, but cold, calculating self-interest. They knew any order they created would pay back a hundred times for the world\u2019s biggest economy.In other words, this liberal world order \u201cis not the product of human evolution\u201d \u2014 as if human beings have somehow learned to be more peaceful with one another, Kagan argued. It developed because the most powerful nation on the planet, the United States of America, \u201cwas born of Enlightenment principles,\u201d and, after being dragged into two world wars in the 20th century, it decided to use its power to spread and maintain those principles \u2014 not everywhere and always, but in many places a lot of the time.And when I say \u201cpower\u201d I don\u2019t just mean military power. I mean also convening power. When the U.N.\u2019s top climate body issues a report \u2014 as it just did \u2014 that says our weather, our ocean levels, our agriculture and our ecosystems are going to be disrupted, so much more than people realize, unless we take huge steps now to mitigate climate change, and the U.S. president ignores it, we are failing in our task to stabilize the liberal global order and are paving the way for disorder.\u201cEvery gardener understands that the forces of nature are always trying to overrun it with vines and weeds \u2014 and it is a constant struggle to keep the jungle back,\u201d said Kagan. Same in geopolitics. We are always tending toward tribalism and authoritarianism and great power conflict. That\u2019s the jungle always trying to return. And U.S. values backed by U.S. power have been what prevented that.So when Trump says that we are just going to look out for ourselves, he shows his ignorance of both history and economics. Trump is pursuing \u201ca great American fantasy,\u201d added Kagan. And it is not a fantasy that we can be \u201cisolationists\u201d and we\u2019ll be O.K. It\u2019s a fantasy that we can be \u201cirresponsible\u201d and we\u2019ll be O.K. The world will be far more threatened by too little American order-making than too much.\u201cIt will be springtime for thugs,\u201d Kagan concluded \u2014 and the signs of that are now multiplying.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Nominee Draws Scrutiny for Ties to Ukrainian Energy Interests", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe head of that team, William N. Bryan, was a career civil servant with an expertise in energy infrastructure and security.But he was a neophyte when it came to the notoriously factional and corrupt world of Ukrainian politics. And it was not long before American and Ukrainian government officials began raising concerns that he was being co-opted by a Ukrainian company seen as aligned with a prominent oligarch \u2014 concerns that grew when Mr. Bryan later joined a consulting firm that pursued business proposals with the company.Now, four years later, those relationships are attracting new scrutiny as Mr. Bryan awaits a Senate confirmation vote to become President Trump\u2019s homeland security under secretary for science and technology.Mr. Bryan said he followed all the rules and made very little money from the private business with Ukrainian entities.As part of the confirmation process, the Senate is examining Mr. Bryan\u2019s relationship with the founders of the Ukrainian company, the Energy Industry Research Center, and his work for the Ukrainian government-owned gas company, Naftogaz.A federal investigative agency is looking into a former colleague\u2019s accusations that Mr. Bryan used his Energy Department position to try to steer government funds to the center, which United States and Ukrainian officials believe to be aligned with Rinat Akhmetov, a billionaire oligarch who maintains close connections to pro-Russia political forces in Ukraine.Mr. Bryan has not been charged with any wrongdoing. In an interview, he said that he \u201cnever made a dime off any of the people I knew from the Ukraine, deliberately, because I didn\u2019t want to violate any of the ethics rules.\u201dWhile operating under that designation at the Energy Department, Mr. Bryan was affiliated with a Virginia consulting firm, ValueBridge International, and he remained with the firm after he left the Energy Department in mid-2016.The overlap between his Energy Department work and ValueBridge\u2019s efforts, revealed in documents and interviews, underscores the lure of big money that is often dangled in front of Washington officials and consultants by powerful foreign interests looking to shape American politics and policy. It also highlights the difficulty in discerning the motivations of those interests.The whistle-blower complaint against Mr. Bryan was filed by Robert Ivy, who worked with Mr. Bryan on the Ukraine project when both men were officials at the Energy Department.Represented by John N. Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit law firm, Mr. Ivy, who remains employed by the Energy Department, filed the complaint last month with the United States Office of Special Counsel, a federal agency that investigates whistle-blower complaints.The complaint, which was obtained by The New York Times, accuses Mr. Bryan of violating ethics rules by working on matters in which he had a financial interest, and of shaping Energy Department policy to benefit Mr. Akhmetov and his allies in exchange for \u201cvaluable promises of future private business dealings.\u201dMr. Akhmetov, whose net worth is estimated to be $5.7 billion, looms large over Ukrainian politics \u2014 and he in some ways set in motion the sequence of events that resulted in the special counsel\u2019s case against Mr. Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.And as the team in Ukraine prepared for its second winter in 2015, some Ukrainian and American officials began questioning whether Mr. Bryan was carrying water for Mr. Akhmetov. They specifically raised concerns about Mr. Bryan\u2019s reliance on data, analysis and recommendations provided by the Energy Industry Research Center, a company widely seen as aligned with Mr. Akhmetov and sometimes in conflict with American priorities for helping Ukraine\u2019s government reduce oligarchs\u2019 influence and stand up to Russia.American officials took the concerns seriously, with one flagging them for an Energy Department political appointee, who responded that \u201cthe reality of Ukraine is that almost everybody is carrying someone else\u2019s water.\u201dThe center has \u201cprovided analytical services\u201d to Mr. Akhmetov\u2019s company, DTEK, and other companies, a DTEK spokeswoman said, but she added that DTEK does not fund the center.Vadym Glamazdin, a founder of the Energy Industry Research Center who worked closely with Mr. Bryan in Ukraine, said the company \u201chas absolutely no connections to Akhmetov.\u201d He said he remains friends with Mr. Bryan, and praised his work in Ukraine as selfless. \u201cWe were able to get through the winters of 2014 and 2015 to a great extent because of the work of Bill and his team, and I, as a Ukrainian, am grateful for what they did for us.\u201dMr. Bryan said he was referred to the center by the Ukrainian government, but had nothing to do with allocating government funds to it.Within a few months of the emails and the letter airing concerns about his relationship with the Energy Industry Research Center, Mr. Bryan retired as a full-time Energy Department official, went on \u201cspecial government employee\u201d status and joined ValueBridge to start an energy consulting practice.Not long afterward, ValueBridge teamed up with the center on a bid for funding from the United States Agency for International Development for a project in Ukraine related to energy and economic development, according to documents and interviews. The proposal was prepared and submitted even as Mr. Bryan continued working with the center as an Energy Department employee.Mr. Bryan left the department for good in mid-2016 and went to work full time at ValueBridge. It signed a contract in February 2017 to represent Naftogaz, the Ukrainian gas company.Mr. Bryan said he made only $4,200 for organizing the Houston event. He said he ultimately lost money at ValueBridge because he dipped into personal funds for business development.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Presidential Race: Who\u2019s Ahead and What to Expect", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 There has been no lack of drama in the lead-up to Brazil\u2019s presidential election on Sunday. One candidate was jailed, another was stabbed and a week before the voting, women organized nationwide protests against the front-runner.The presidential contest, the most splintered and divisive race since the end of the military dictatorship in the 1980s, has for many Brazilians come down to who is the least bad option.The front-runner by a wide margin is the far-right former army captain, Jair Bolsonaro, according to the polls. A member of Congress since 1991, he was long a marginal figure best known for incendiary comments defending Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship and attacking women, gays and blacks.In addition to electing the next president from a field of 13 candidates, voters will also choose 27 governors and more than 1,600 state and federal lawmakers. In Brazil, there are 147.3 million eligible voters, and voting is obligatory.As anger and frustration with entrenched political corruption has grown, Mr. Bolsonaro has presented himself as an anti-establishment maverick who could effectively combat corruption and rein in soaring violence and crime.His main rival, former S\u00e3o Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, entered the race only last month. He was selected to represent the left-wing Workers\u2019 Party after the former president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, was sentenced to prison on corruption charges and barred from running as the party\u2019s candidate.Until the courts ruled him out, Mr. da Silva had been leading in the polls. But it appears that the Workers\u2019 Party has been unable to transfer Mr. da Silva\u2019s broad support among impoverished Brazilians to the less charismatic Mr. Haddad.The crowded field also includes Marina Silva, the daughter of Amazon rubber tappers; Geraldo Alckmin, the pragmatic and market-friendly former governor of S\u00e3o Paulo; and a candidate, Cabo Daciolo, who describes himself as a messenger from heaven.Still, some analysts think that Mr. Bolsonaro, 63, could defy the projections and emerge victorious on Sunday night despite \u2014 or perhaps because of \u2014 his lack of support from a major political party and a shoestring budget that relied on social media to build a base.Brazil uses an electronic ballot system and is expected to tally results within a couple of hours after polling stations close in the westernmost state of Acre at 6 p.m. Eastern Time.Soaring crime, the worst recession on record and institutionalized political corruption have been the three main issues in the campaign.Despite accomplishing little of note during his seven terms as a lawmaker, Mr. Bolsonaro gained prominence when a massive corruption investigation known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash, engulfed all of Brazil\u2019s major political parties.He cultivated an image as an abrasive, but honest politician with a clean record. This was in contrast with the Workers\u2019 Party, which has been largely blamed for the vast bribery schemes of the past decade and a half.Mr. Bolsonaro, who insists that he is the only candidate tough enough to stop criminals, has posed often for photos with his fingers pointed like loaded pistols. With his unfiltered comments and amateur videos on social media, he offered ready solutions for the country\u2019s problems: He wants to make it easier for citizens to own guns and for the police to shoot criminals.As his standing in the polls has improved, opponents rallied behind the motto #EleN\u00e3o, or #NotHim, taking to the streets and the internet to encourage voters to elect anyone but Mr. Bolsonaro.Brazil\u2019s sputtering economy has also divided voters. Many of the country\u2019s poorest people, who benefited from expanded social programs during Mr. da Silva\u2019s two terms as president, have embraced his stand-in, Mr. Haddad. The Workers\u2019 Party insisted that Mr. Haddad \u201cwould make Brazil happy again.\u201dBut many other voters blame the Workers\u2019 Party for the deep recession that started on its watch. Every time the polls show Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s popularity growing, the markets rally on the hope that he will curtail social spending and make fiscal changes.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters also worry that a victory for Mr. Haddad would deal a blow to the Car Wash investigation, which might lead to Mr. da Silva being freed from prison, despite his corruption conviction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Two Iowas? Candidates for Governor Try to Claim Both", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMARSHALLTOWN, Iowa \u2014 When Fred Hubbell addresses an audience, he does not pace but picks a spot, plants his feet and hardly moves.The scion of a wealthy family from Des Moines, Mr. Hubbell often reverts to business themes when talking about his Democratic bid for governor.\u201cIf you\u2019re the governor in Iowa, you\u2019re the C.E.O. of the state,\u201d he said in a recent interview.When the incumbent, Kim Reynolds, talks, she spreads her arms wide and sometimes speaks so quickly she sounds like a state fair auctioneer. A Republican, Ms. Reynolds describes herself as a \u201csmall-town girl\u201d and has tried to paint Mr. Hubbell as a liberal elitist.\u201cHe just doesn\u2019t know Iowans,\u201d she said after a recent Republican Party dinner. \u201cI just don\u2019t think he understands them.\u201d\u201cMy story,\u201d Ms. Reynolds likes to say, \u201cis the Iowa story.\u201dSince President Trump captured Iowa by nearly 10 points in 2016, two versions of Iowa \u2014 cosmopolitan and progressive, rural and conservative \u2014 have been battling to define the state\u2019s identity.Now, with the midterm elections less than three weeks away, a related question has emerged in this closely watched race for governor between Ms. Reynolds and Mr. Hubbell: Which candidate is more Iowan?The political makeup in Iowa would suggest that voters are leaning in Ms. Reynolds\u2019s direction. In addition to Mr. Trump\u2019s victory here, Republicans now hold both Senate seats, three of the state\u2019s four congressional districts, the governor\u2019s seat and both branches of the Legislature.But if Iowa seems to have moved toward an irreversible reddening, energized Democrats are hoping that the elections in November will prove otherwise.The elections are not just an early test for Iowa Democrats. The outcomes, particularly in the governor\u2019s race, will send a message about the political mood of this bellwether state and its first-in-the-nation caucuses, when it will pass judgment on what is shaping up to be the most diverse field of Democratic presidential candidates in history. Already, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey has campaigned in the state. In the coming days, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Kamala Harris of California will arrive as well.Gov. Kim Reynolds greeted supporters after a debate against Mr. Hubbell in Des Moines this month.Political strategists list several reasons Iowa could reverse course, including a Trump-initiated trade war that disproportionately affects the state\u2019s farmers, and an economy that, while strong nationally, has nevertheless left many behind, Democrats say. There is also no United States Senate race to help mobilize Republicans.Even some Republicans acknowledge that Democrats have momentum.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re as red as we seem today,\u201d said Craig Robinson, a consultant and a former political director of the Iowa Republican Party. \u201cIf you look at what happened in 2016 and the makeup with the Legislature, we look very red. But I also think there\u2019s weaknesses with Iowa Republicans that we don\u2019t necessarily boast and talk about.\u201dIn small towns across the state, there are farmers and working-class voters who appreciate plenty about Mr. Trump, including his anti-trade message. Even on Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war, which is driving down the prices of soybeans and corn, many farmers have taken a wait-and-see approach.\u201cA lot of us are disgusted with what the Democrats have been doing,\u201d said Joleen Ballard, 66, who was selling pumpkins and gourds at a fall festival in Toledo, a small town about 70 miles from Des Moines. She voted for Mr. Trump, she said. And come Election Day, she planned to vote for Ms. Reynolds.\u201cShe\u2019s been through what a lot of us in Iowa have,\u201d Ms. Ballard said. \u201cShe\u2019s one of us.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s success among white, working-class voters spanned much of the Midwest, powering victories in Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio. As Democrats try to reclaim these states, they are counting on young voters, women and minorities in the cities and suburbs to provide the bulk of Democratic support. But here in Iowa and elsewhere, they are also making appeals to small-town voters who went for Mr. Trump.It was no coincidence, for example, that Mr. Hubbell chose as his running mate Rita Hart, a farmer and state senator who represents rural areas in the eastern part of the state.Mr. Hubbell, whose family name is so entrenched in Des Moines that one of the main roads leading out of the city is called Hubbell Avenue, likes to talk about how he is a fifth-generation Iowan. He is banking heavily on a moderate, Iowa-focused message that revolves around \u201cbread-and-butter issues\u201d \u2014 health care, education, the economy.He tends to pepper his remarks with financially abstruse phrases like \u201cfiscal impact analysis\u201d and \u201ctax-credit review panel.\u201d He rarely, if ever, mentions Mr. Trump. \u201cI got to be honest with you,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m pretty well focused on what\u2019s going on in our state.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a fiscally responsible person and a progressive on social issues,\u201d Mr. Hubbell said. \u201cWhen I talk to people, if I ask them to describe themselves, 80 percent of them say they\u2019re that.\u201dOn a recent Monday afternoon, Mr. Hubbell, 67, addressed a small crowd of mostly seniors in a cramped room for a get-out-the-vote rally in Marshalltown, a city of 27,000 about an hour northeast of Des Moines. In July, it had been hit hard by a tornado, and many windows in buildings on Main Street were still blown out. The air smelled damp and vaguely like mothballs.\u201cWe\u2019re hoping your tornado hits the Republicans!\u201d someone in the audience yelled to Mr. Hubbell. \u201cI hope it\u2019s just as powerful.\u201d\u201cIf it is,\u201d Mr. Hubbell said, flatly, \u201cit will get a lot of Democrats elected.\u201dMs. Reynolds, 59, also likes to talk about how she is a fifth-generation Iowan. Where Mr. Hubbell can appear stiff, she is constantly moving.\u201cI\u2019m a hugger,\u201d she said at one point during a brief interview, stopping, again, to offer someone a hug.Previously the lieutenant governor to Terry E. Branstad \u2014 before Mr. Trump named him ambassador to China \u2014 Ms. Reynolds was appointed the state\u2019s first female governor last year. She is anti-abortion \u2014 she recently signed a bill banning abortion after six weeks \u2014 a stance Democrats view as a potential weakness among social progressives but which endears her to Iowa\u2019s large evangelical population. Like many Republican candidates, she warns that her opponent wants to raise voters\u2019 taxes.Around the state, opinions about the candidates are mixed.\u201cKim Reynolds is keeping the seat warm for Terry Branstad,\u201d said Dave Musgrove, a 57-year-old project manager from Des Moines. He and his wife, who were walking in a steady rain on the way to vote early, said they supported Mr. Hubbell.Out in Traer, a rural farming town of under 2,000 with dirt roads that can turn to mud, Ken Adolphs felt differently.\u201cThe only thing I can say about Fred,\u201d he said, referring to Mr. Hubbell, \u201cis he was a man born with a silver spoon in his mouth.\u201dMr. Adolphs, 69, owns a 300-acre farm where he grows corn, soybeans and vegetables. As he drove a utility vehicle across his fields, he pointed out where cattle graze.Democrats are hoping farmers like Mr. Adolphs vote out Republican incumbents in part because they feel squeezed by Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war.But Mr. Adolphs is having none of it.He acknowledged that the tariffs were pushing prices down, but said he was playing the long game. \u201cThe thought out here,\u201d he said, \u201cis if you can get more balance in the trade, things are going to work out better.\u201dWhen his tour of the farm was done, he pulled back around to the front of his house.On his lawn was an American flag. Beside it were yard signs for Republicans.Advertisement"}

Beijing hopes it can convince those voters \u2014 and their elected representatives \u2014 that the president\u2019s trade war could hurt them.Over the summer, the Chinese took aim at Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader. In his home state, Kentucky, 18,000 jobs depend on whiskey. So they put a 25 percent tariff on it. Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, is from Wisconsin, a leading producer of cranberries. So cranberries were added to the list, for good measure. And China went after pork and soybeans, two of the leading farm products in Iowa, home of Charles E.  Grassley, a powerful member of the Senate Agriculture Committee.\u201cForty percent of our exports are now under punitive tariffs,\u201d said Jim Monroe, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council.Share of all export-dependent jobs that are threatened by tariffs within counties won by:Trump8.1%Clinton3.2%The Chinese aren\u2019t the only ones playing this game. Mexico also took aim at whiskey. So did the European Union. And Canada. Mexico added pressure on Mr. Grassley\u2019s voters with a tariff on pork. The European Union sent a message to the House speaker by singling out motorcycles \u2014 delivering a blow to Harley-Davidson, which is based in his state.While trade relations with Mexico and Canada may be more cordial now that they have reached a deal with the United States to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mexican and Canadian tariffs are likely to remain in place until the Trump administration lifts its original protectionist measures.With China, the war remains hot. Last month, Mr. Trump announced tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to top off the original list of $50 billion. China has announced retaliation on a total of  $110 billion worth of goods from the United States.The target lists drawn up by the United States\u2019 four largest trading partners show a similar pattern.Mexico\u2019s tariffs0.2%1.4%5.2%Share of all export-dependentjobs that are threatenedCanada\u2019s tariffs0.7%3.2%14%European Union\u2019s tariffs0.3%1.1%5.8%Mexico\u2019s tariffs0.2%1.4%5.2%Share of all export-dependent jobs that are threatenedCanada\u2019s tariffs0.7%3.2%14%European Union\u2019s tariffs0.3%1.1%5.8%Mexico\u2019s tariffsCanada\u2019s tariffsEuropean Union\u2019s tariffs0.2%1.4%5.2%0.7%3.2%14%0.3%1.1%5.8%Share of all export-dependent jobsthat are threatenedMexico\u2019s tariffsCanada\u2019s tariffsEuropean Union\u2019s tariffs0.2%1.4%5.2%0.7%3.2%14%0.3%1.1%5.8%Share of all export-dependent jobsthat are threatenedMexico\u2019s tariffsCanada\u2019s tariffsEuropean Union\u2019s tariffs0.2%1.4%5.2%0.7%3.2%14%0.3%1.1%5.8%Share of all export-dependent jobsthat are threatenedThink of the workers assembling Harleys on the shop floor and the truck drivers hauling finished hogs to port. The geography of the retaliation \u2014 two rounds from China and one each from Mexico, the European Union and Canada \u2014 reveals the common calculations.Tariffs are, in the first instance, a shot in the foot. They raise the cost of imports, hurting domestic consumers as well as companies that import intermediate goods \u2014 from steel to integrated circuits \u2014 that go into their finished products.In designing a retaliation package, a primary objective is to limit self-inflicted harm. \u201cThe first priority is that the tariffs should have a minimum impact on prices of basic consumer goods in Mexico, the second that they don\u2019t disrupt our value chains, including products which have alternative sources of supply,\u201d said Guillermo Malpica Soto, who heads the office dealing with trade and Nafta for Mexico\u2019s Economy Ministry in Washington.Political messaging comes in third. \u201cWe choose states where we can create the right political incentives to get this resolved soon,\u201d Mr. Malpica said.The objective, at least at the beginning, did not require much precision targeting. Other countries could hit mostly Republican-held, pro-Trump enclaves simply by focusing on steel and aluminum \u2014 much of which comes from the declining industrial areas that delivered the Midwest to the president \u2014 and agricultural goods from rural America, which remains deeply Republican. Even Canada\u2019s retaliation, which Ottawa said was dictated strictly by reciprocity, weighs more heavily on Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters.The Brookings researchers estimated that 13 percent of export-dependent jobs in rural America were affected by the tariffs, in that they depend either directly or indirectly on products hit by tariffs. Big, diverse cities with large service economies are somewhat more insulated. In large metropolitan areas, only 3.5 percent of export-dependent jobs are exposed.30%2520CountiesClinton wonShare of all export- dependent jobs that are threatenedTrend lineCountiesTrump won0010%2030405060708090Trump\u2019s share of county election votes30%2520Share of all export- dependent jobs that are threatenedTrend line10CountiesClinton wonCountiesTrump won50010%2030405060708090100Trump\u2019s share of county election votes30%2520Share of all export- dependent jobs that are threatened15Trend line10CountiesClinton wonCountiesTrump won50010%2030405060708090100Trump\u2019s share of county election votes30%2520Share of all export- dependent jobs that are threatened15Trend line10CountiesClinton wonCountiesTrump won50010%2030405060708090100Trump\u2019s share of county election votesBut choosing targets has become more difficult. Chad P. Bown at the Peterson Institute for International Economics notes that China was more precise in its first round of retaliation \u2014 focused heavily on agricultural products \u2014 than in its second round in September. By then it had exhausted its agricultural imports from the United States and had to put tariffs on lots of intermediate goods, parts and components that lack the same political impact and might damage supply chains at home.Tariffs do change behavior. In 1971, President Richard M. Nixon imposed a 10 percent tariff across the board in the hope of forcing Japan, Germany and some other countries to revalue their currencies. The tactic worked within months. In the 1980s, tariffs on Italian wine and French cheese helped persuade the European Union to put its Common Agricultural Policy on the negotiating table in the talks that created the World Trade Organization.Retaliation can be an effective defense. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs of 1930, imposed by Congress on 800 imported products, as varied as wool and goldfish, are the most notable precedent for the trade war that Mr. Trump seems to have in mind. They set off a tit-for-tat brawl that stifled trade around the world, lengthening the Great Depression.But Douglas Irwin, a trade historian at Dartmouth College, argues that the retaliation by American trading partners made a difference. Republicans weren\u2019t swayed. But once Democrats took over the government in 1933, they heeded the pleas of Southern agricultural interests shut out of European markets. In 1934 President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act and set off a cascade of tariff reductions.Those episodes are hardly perfect analogies. But history does suggest it\u2019s best to hit back. \u201cIt inflicts a political cost and acts as a deterrent,\u201d Professor Irwin said. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t face a political cost, who knows what Trump would do?\u201d He still has a further $250 billion or so worth of Chinese imports to hit.Sources: Brookings Institution (tariff data); David Leip\u2019s U.S. Election Atlas (election data)Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mexico\u2019s President-Elect Rethinks His Campaign Promises", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Winning Mexico\u2019s presidency this summer did not slow down Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador: Three months into his transition, he is traveling across the country to thank voters, replay his campaign promises and pledge, \u201cI will not fail you.\u201dBut now there\u2019s often an asterisk: \u201cWe wish we could give more.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador was elected by a landslide in July on a mandate to battle corruption, reduce soaring violence and tackle the country\u2019s entrenched inequality. Now those promises are colliding against a reality too complex to be reduced to a stump speech.As a result, a new note has crept into his speeches. He has backtracked on many of his signature issues and hedged on his commitments, trying to whittle down his supporters\u2019 outsize expectations.During his campaign, he had vowed to cancel construction of a costly airport to replace Mexico City\u2019s congested hub. Now, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador says citizens will decide the airport\u2019s fate in a vote later this month. Critics say the poll\u2019s design is rigged against the new airport; fewer than 2 percent of Mexico\u2019s voters will get ballots.Some Mexicans and analysts say these shifts might be the result of a pragmatic and necessary adjustment to the reality of governing, after the hyperbole of campaigning.As he prepares to switch from the opposition to the role of president on Dec. 1, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador \u201cis seeing Mexico with different eyes for the first time,\u201d said Jes\u00fas Silva-Herzog, a political scientist at the School of Government at the Tec de Monterrey in Mexico City.He now has a \u201cheavy responsibility on his shoulders,\u201d Mr. Silva-Herzog added, and that edges him toward a more prudent stance.Others are less charitable. Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador is improvising, critics say, because he had given little thought to the nuts and bolts of governing.\u201cSomeone who has almost 20 years of experience campaigning and still does not know what to do shows that either he isn\u2019t very concerned about change through policymaking \u2014 or he does not know how to do it,\u201d said Vidal Romero, a political scientist at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, a university in Mexico City.Either way, the uncertainty over what to expect is extremely troubling, Mr. Romero said.The president-elect, who promised to abstain from the lavish lifestyle of Mexico\u2019s political elite \u2014 to the point of saying he would sell the presidential plane and fly commercial \u2014 has even stumbled over image issues.Such missteps and reversals take a toll, said Carlos Bravo Regidor, the director of the journalism program at CIDE, a Mexico City university.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador \u201cisn\u2019t president yet and already he is administering disappointment,\u201d Mr. Bravo said.Governing also requires solid institutional capabilities that Mexico does not have, Mr. Bravo said. Building those, he said, is a slow and painful task that does not render results in the short term \u2014 a reality that the president-elect will soon confront.\u201cHe believes that strong honest leadership can go a long way,\u201d Mr. Bravo said. \u201cBut there\u2019s a point where that sort of an iron will is not enough.\u201dNowhere is that more obvious than in dealing with Mexico\u2019s unchecked violence, where the new government will have to take on the escalating murder rate and the impunity associated with 12 years of the government\u2019s drug war.\u201cThe challenges are extraordinary, and the victims have the right to truth and justice,\u201d said Guillermo Trejo, a professor at the University of Notre Dame. \u201cThe state has the responsibility to respond.\u201dMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s response so far has involved mixed signals.In moves that were widely welcomed by human rights groups, he has promised to work with international organizations to look for the tens of thousands of Mexicans who went missing during the drug war.Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador and his transition team have met with anguished relatives of Mexico\u2019s dead and missing at forums around the country \u2014 including the parents of 43 students who vanished after their arrests four years ago.But earlier this month, Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s incoming public security minister canceled the last five forums with families of victims \u2014 with a tweet. This was interpreted as a slap in the face to victims in those states, which are among the most violent in the country.Tackling the problem requires more than the good will of the president, analysts said. It requires effective law enforcement \u2014 and Mexico has weak judicial and police systems which, in many cases, have been co-opted by or colluded with organized crime.A first step to strengthen the judicial system would be creating an independent attorney general\u2019s office. But a bill introduced in Congress by Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s party, which has an effective majority, would leave key elements, like the selection of the person to fill the position, in the president\u2019s hands.While Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador has made significant adjustments to his promises even before taking office, Mr. Silva-Herzog said, more may be in store.\u201cThe reality will prove to be much more stubborn than what he expects,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Nashville, Tennessee, 11:02 P.M.", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "Documenting moments across the country, large and small, quiet and indelible.Supported byWhen this project was being conceived, a storm named Florence did not exist. It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L. Whitfield sermonized from the Gospel According to John. In one of the pews they built a dollhouse out of Bibles. Pastor Whitfield was baptized in the bayou that runs behind the church 54 years ago. Now he was leading the small congregation, sweat beading on his brow.Sunday at noon in the United States. Two girls and their dolls, salvation and stories in the air.

He was a manager at a lunch meat manufacturing company and was active in most every way, and played a range of sports.Not very far beneath the surface, though, were warning signs. There were nine children on his mother\u2019s side of the family; all but one of his mother\u2019s siblings died of heart disease. One of Troy\u2019s uncles died at 36.

Stark, the little boy, stared out at all of this, a child of the desert in dank, humid air, and then he looked up at his father and said that when he grew up he was going to play professional soccer in Italy, and then he was going to come back to Florida and be a fishing guide.We set out to document 24 different hours in 24 states, to shine a lens on the lives of people rarely in the headlines.

Whitfield, 69, was baptized in the 15-mile bayou that runs behind True Vine Missionary Baptist Church in 1964, but it took him 35 years to get back to this place where he was first made in the spirit. In the intervening time, he came of age, worked as a contractor, had daughters and sons, built two churches with his own hands and led them, and saw his sons join the ministry and lead their own congregations in other Delta towns.His return to his spiritual birthplace was not a matter of if, but rather when \u2014 18 years ago this month.

{"Headline": "You\u2019ve Become Rich. That Doesn\u2019t Mean You\u2019re Great at Everything.", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewIn allowing the best competitors to rise to the top in our market economy, we allow enormous wealth to concentrate in relatively few hands. The competition that produced Apple, Tesla and Google has also produced billionaires.Perversely, the wealth generated this way is having an unintended consequence. Wealth accumulated in one arena is frequently used to acquire control in others. The result is far from efficient, since success in one arena hardly assures success in another.The problem is obvious in sports.In basketball or baseball, for example, teams place their best players in the game in the crucial moments that separate a win from a loss. You might think that there should be similar care taken in the executive suite, too, so that the best managers are in place to make the crucial business decisions. Yet sports superstars like Michael Jordan or Derek Jeter \u2014 as well as businessmen like James Dolan of the Knicks and Rangers, but originally of the Cablevision empire \u2014 have been running teams with less than monumental success in the won-lost column.It\u2019s quite possible, of course, that the best days are still to come for Mr. Jordan\u2019s Charlotte Hornets, Mr. Dolan\u2019s teams and for the Miami Marlins, which Mr. Jeter hasn\u2019t run for very long. But it still seems fair to say that while money is portable from one field to another, talent often is not.This problem is hardly unique to sports. It is endemic in free markets. Success and wealth that move from one arena to another often breed inefficiency.Of course the leap from talented salesperson to manager is nowhere near as large or as consequential as the leaps that great wealth allows.A hedge fund manager who buys a newspaper has the power to decide what constitutes news. A rich app developer who starts a foundation can decide which philanthropic projects are worthwhile. A real estate developer who donates heavily to a local theater may have considerable influence over which plays will come to life.Neither wealth accumulation nor the use of wealth to influence a wide array of unrelated ventures is particularly new, of course: The rich have been patrons of the arts and sciences for decades.But the phenomenon of wealthy people seeking to influence areas in which they have no particular expertise appears to be particularly severe today, partly because of the young age at which people can now become wealthy. The problem is not that younger people are less able than older ones. It is that they have more years in which to meddle.Competition places some constraints on how long the wealthy can stay at the top. But not much.While reputation depreciates, wealth accumulates. An athlete cannot keep playing solely on the basis of his performance from a decade ago. Wealth, however, has a long memory, and it brings its own luck. Virtually all major league sports teams have increased in value, both the good ones and the bad ones. The biggest challenge is being wealthy enough to own one in the first place.Short of wholesale revamping of the economy, we cannot change the power wealth gives. We can, however, work to thwart one of the accomplices to the problem: our own psychologies, which magnify the power of wealth.Psychologists studying stereotypes have noted that one of the most basic dimensions for evaluating people is by their competence. The problem is that competence is often viewed as a general attribute; rather than realizing that people are skilled at individual activities, we imagine that they are talented at nearly everything. We overgeneralize ability.Few beliefs play to human hubris more than the belief in the universality of talent \u2014 a belief that successful people have the \u201cit\u201d that lets them do great things in every walk of life, certainly including politics.Wealth can be intoxicating, leading a billionaire into economically destructive narcissism. Like nepotism, this kind of narcissism favors familiarity over talent, except that the person being privileged is yourself.But the successful do not just benefit from their own wealth. They benefit from our mistaken perceptions. The fungibility of wealth amplifies this faulty and dangerous notion that money is equivalent to generalized ability.Each of us can temper how we view successful people, recognizing that their talents are specific. Running a tech startup that makes billions doesn\u2019t make one a virtuoso who can disrupt all industries. Managing an investment fund doesn\u2019t give one deep insight into which social projects will have the greatest impact on poverty. And so on.When someone builds a better mousetrap, the world should beat a path to his door.

One of the greatest horrors born that day was that it was little surprise.\u201cWe failed the people of Palu,\u201d said Rusdy Mastura, the city\u2019s former mayor.In a front-line earthquake zone, much of Palu had sprung up in the form of unreinforced buildings on soft ground. A tsunami was quickly detected, but no siren rang around the city. And despite hard lessons from previous natural disasters in which the Indonesian authorities discouraged outside help at the expense of their citizens, the international aid effort in Palu was still dogged by resistance and confusion.The most prominent active fault on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, Palu Koro is akin to a \u201cfault superhighway,\u201d according to Ian M. Watkinson, a seismologist who has studied the area, which is part of an earthquake-plagued arc along the Pacific Ocean called the Ring of Fire.In a paper first published online in 2016, Mr. Watkinson and Robert Hall of Royal Holloway, University of London, warned that what made the city of Palu so ideal for human habitation \u2014 fertile land on a horseshoe bay, backed by verdant mountains \u2014 was also what made it so dangerous.Mr. Watkinson and Mr. Hall wrote in their paper that Palu was particularly at risk for strong earthquakes, the liquefaction of its soft and saturated soil, and tsunamis barreling down its narrow bay.All three calamities struck on Sept. 28.\u201cIt\u2019s not that we wanted to be right,\u201d Mr. Watkinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s that the geological evidence pointed very strongly to the likelihood of something like this occurring.\u201dIn 2012, the Geological Agency at Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources produced a map of Palu that documented areas where liquefaction was likely to occur. Many of the city\u2019s large residential zones \u2014 like Petobo and Balaroa, another neighborhood inundated on Sept. 28 \u2014 were included in the highest-risk red zone.\u201cWe delivered the geological map to the Central Sulawesi government,\u201d said Sri Hidayati, who runs the earthquake mitigation division at the geological agency. \u201cBut probably they didn\u2019t know the meaning of the map. We never received any feedback.\u201dAs Indonesia\u2019s economy developed, Palu\u2019s population surged, prompting new developments on swampy, sandy soil. Nearby deforestation and gold mining shifted sediment in the region, making the ground less stable underfoot.Petobo and Balaroa, another Palu neighborhood inundated by liquefaction, used to be mainly sago fields, flat expanses with ample water access. When the government began building subsidized housing for new residents, many of them civil servants, in the 1980s and 1990s, this converted farmland seemed a natural fit.\u201cWe never knew about liquefaction,\u201d said Suhardy, a building contractor who lives near Balaroa. \u201cWhat we only knew was that Palu is earthquake-prone.\u201dThe dangers of the earth are hard-wired into Indonesians. On Thursday, a 6.0 magnitude earthquake struck offshore near the islands of Bali and Java, and at least three people were reported killed. On Saturday, a 5.6 magnitude quake hit northern Sulawesi.\u201cThe whole of Indonesia is at high risk of earthquakes,\u201d said Rahmat Triyono, the earthquake and tsunami chief at the Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency. With four tectonic plates jostling under the Indonesian archipelago, the country is now cleaved by 295 active faults, up from 81 in 2010.Yet in the rush to accommodate a rapidly urbanizing country, new buildings were thrown up, often made of poor quality cement, Mr. Watkinson said.\u201cThere\u2019s a transition time when the growth of a country exceeds the ability for building engineers to design for peak survivability,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you compare to Tokyo or Santiago, which have strictly enforced building codes and earthquake-resistant buildings, none of that is possible in a city like Palu.\u201dSukmandaru Prihatmoko, chairman of the Indonesian Association of Geologists, said that although Indonesian building codes looked adequate on paper, \u201cenforcement has been weak, very weak.\u201dBuilding the foundations of houses beyond the sandy layer that is prone to liquefaction could have prevented loss of life in Palu, Mr. Sukmandaru said.\u201cThen again, if you are building a housing complex, you don\u2019t really want to add that extra cost of an extra deep foundation,\u201d he added.In the days following Palu\u2019s tragedy, with 70,000 people displaced and aftershocks still unnerving survivors, the city\u2019s leadership seemed to have disappeared.Neither the mayor of Palu, Hidayat, nor the vice mayor, Sigit Purnomo Syamsuddin Said, responded to repeated calls and text messages from The New York Times.\u201cWhere are the civil servants? Where was the governor\u2019s office? Where was the mayor\u2019s office?\u201d Vice President Jusuf Kalla of Indonesia asked last week in Jakarta, the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cThe government was not present when they were needed.\u201dInstead, the military has tried to instill order. But in the chaotic days after the quake, soldiers could be seen helping themselves to some of the supplies trucked in by aid groups or standing by as residents swarmed the vehicles. With little information flowing in from local officials, military personnel dispatched to Palu struggled to calculate the body count, stumbling over basic addition.In one case, updates to the daily death toll were foiled when it was discovered that the previous day\u2019s numbers had been written on a whiteboard in permanent marker.And although foreign aid was eventually allowed in, unlike during the earthquake on the island of Lombok in August, the national disaster mitigation agency took to Twitter last week to warn that \u201cforeign citizens who are working with foreign NGOs are not allowed to conduct any activity on the sites affected,\u201d ordering international groups to \u201cretrieve their personnel immediately.\u201dThe next day, the Foreign Ministry issued a statement clarifying that the directive was not meant as a blanket renunciation of foreign aid but rather a plea for better integration with local agencies.\u201cAll assistance including foreign volunteers should only enter after coordination and approval has been given, so their purpose, role and function are clear,\u201d the statement said.But foreign aid workers continue to complain of delays in getting supplies approved for import and of being hassled on the ground by officials.\u201cWe are an earthquake- and tsunami-prone country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe risks are very clear, but the budget allocated does not match the risks.\u201dChains of command are frayed. On Sept. 28, a tsunami warning was issued by the agency a couple of minutes after the quake. A siren had been placed near Palu\u2019s stadium for just that purpose. But it never sounded. Mr. Rahmat said that he was still unsure why.\u201cWe also have to check if the system is 24 hours,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe when the warning went out, the office had closed. We don\u2019t know.\u201dOr perhaps it was human error by a government worker that resulted in merrymakers at a beach festival in Palu being swept out to sea, never aware that a tsunami was rolling in.\u201cEven though the operator\u2019s job is to turn on the siren, it\u2019s human to panic, then run,\u201d Mr. Rahmat said.In Gorontalo Province, on the same island as Palu and marred by another major active fault, Sultan Kalupe, the head of the spatial planning division of the provincial ministry of public works, said he was surprised to hear from a Times reporter that a government map had been issued in 2012 cautioning that his region was at a high risk of liquefaction.The Gorontalo map was issued by the Geological Agency the same year Palu\u2019s hazards were published.\u201cWe never knew such a study existed,\u201d Mr. Sultan said. \u201cIf there is such a study, that would be great because we are revising our city plan.\u201dIn the wake of the Palu earthquake, he said, city officials were intent on moving residents away from the most liquefaction-prone areas. Where the money for this project will come from is unclear.\u201cWhen you know you have the potential for disaster but you didn\u2019t make any plan,\u201d Mr. Sultan said, \u201cthat\u2019s catastrophic.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Trump Trade Strategy Is Coming Into Focus. That Doesn\u2019t Necessarily Mean It Will Work.", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTaking an aggressive stance with traditional allies now seems to be just a warm-up for the main event: isolating China.But that has changed in recent weeks, with a more coherent approach starting to become apparent \u2014 though not one with any guarantee of success.The strategy that has jelled goes something like this: The president has been beating up on traditional allies, including Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Japan and South Korea. He has been assailing them publicly, placing tariffs on their steel and aluminum, and threatening to tax their automobiles. But fundamentally, that was just about softening them up to extract moderate concessions favorable to American interests.Now that the administration has shown it can get to yes with those deals, similarly patterned agreements with Europe and Japan are expected to come next. After revised deals with those allies are in place, the administration will most likely seek a concerted effort among them to isolate China and compel major changes to Chinese business and trade practices. One telling piece of evidence for this strategy: a provision in the new North American deal that will make it hard for Mexico or Canada to negotiate a trade deal with a \u201cnonmarket\u201d economy like China without risking their favored access to the United States\u2019 huge market.Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, outlined this strategy at the Economic Club of Washington on Thursday. \u201cChina is first and foremost,\u201d he said at one point.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of unfair trading practices, and the biggest culprit is China,\u201d he said. The administration was able to complete the new North American deal, he said, with \u201ca combination of pressure and negotiations.\u201d\u201cWe are talking to the European Union again, we are talking to Japan again, and we are moving to what I have characterized as a trade coalition of the willing to confront China,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said. (He didn\u2019t note that he\u2019d borrowed a term also used for the allies that joined in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which President Trump has called a disaster.)The sense among analysts that the administration has been pursuing a single coherent strategy contrasts with earlier in the year. At that point, from the outside at least, the administration seemed to be changing its approach by the week, and sometimes by the day. It has often seemed that there has been a series of improvised moves, with different senior officials favoring different approaches.Now, with the new North American deal, it\u2019s become easier to see how the different elements of Trump trade fit together. The \u201cnonmarket\u201d provision seems devised to give the United States veto power over any deal Canada or Mexico might seek with China.But just because there is a more coherent strategy in the administration\u2019s stance toward global trade than in the recent past doesn\u2019t mean it will work. And there are still plenty of reasons for skepticism.\u201cI do think we can see a strategy, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good strategy,\u201d said Mary E. Lovely, a professor at Syracuse University and a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThey\u2019re going to use these bilateral deals to strong-arm countries into lining up behind the U.S. on China. But when we get there, what\u2019s the next step? I don\u2019t know what the endgame is.\u201dThere\u2019s a risk that even if the effort to isolate China succeeds, the result might be simply a bifurcated world trade system in which there is one orbit of countries with close ties to the United States, and another tied to China, with minimal overlap.A crucial question is whether the administration\u2019s strategy of pummeling allies with attacks, threats and tariffs can yield not just revised trade agreements, but also the trust needed to undertake a concerted campaign against China.Ms. Lovely jokes that it would really be the \u201ccoalition of the coerced\u201d rather than Mr. Kudlow\u2019s \u201ccoalition of the willing.\u201dThe new North American deal, a case study in such unwillingness, shares many elements with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which was negotiated by the Obama administration and abandoned by the Trump administration in early 2017.The whole agreement was intended as a strategic counterweight to Chinese economic power in the Pacific Rim.But rather than reopen the T.P.P., the Trump administration chose the path of separate deals with each country. The bet is that the United States will have greater negotiating leverage in a series of bilateral deals with allies than it would in some large multicountry agreement \u2014 even if many of the details of agreements end up looking similar, as was the case with the new U.S.M.C.A.The risk of that approach is that when the United States hammers out each deal separately, it may be hard to then turn around and create any kind of unified pressure against China.\u201cTo go into battle, together, you need to know that a partner is reliable, that if they tell you something, they\u2019ll stick to it,\u201d said Phil Levy, a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. \u201cThis administration has been anything but reliable on trade policy.\u201dStill, a few things are apparent now that were not at all clear at the beginning of the summer.The Trump administration isn\u2019t just looking to blow things up; so long as negotiators can claim victory for American interests, there are deals to be had for allies. And unpleasant as trade skirmishes with Europe or Canada or Japan may be, they\u2019re really a warm-up for a trade war with China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Cameroon on Brink of Civil War as English Speakers Recount \u2018Unbearable\u2019 Horrors", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBUEA, Cameroon \u2014 A soldier\u2019s crumpled corpse at a traffic circle. Young men gunned down in their living room while partying. A teenage boy killed by a stray bullet while watching television. Outbursts of gunfire so frequent that children call them \u201cfrying popcorn.\u201dThe horrors residents recount here at the base of cloud-covered Mount Cameroon are part of a conflict that has been upending the English-speaking regions of this country in recent months.\u201cThis situation, it\u2019s unbearable,\u201d said Leonard Etuge, one of the few holdouts still living in a once-bustling neighborhood along a highway called Mile 16 that is now littered with charred, overturned vehicles and shell casings.Cameroon is still grappling with a tangled colonial past that involved three European powers \u2014 Germany, France and Britain \u2014 and in recent years, it has become a vital partner of the United States in the battle against Islamist extremism in Africa.Now, the country is on the brink of civil war.Mr. Biya has been traveling the country to rally support in a contest expected to be highly lopsided, given his tight grip on the nation. Separatists have vowed to do all they can to disrupt the vote, escalating an already volatile situation.200 mileschadNIGERIABamendaCENTRALAFRICANREPUBLICcameroonYaound\u00e9Area ofdetailCONGOREPUBLICGulf ofGuineaGABONMT. CAMEROONEkonaN8BueaN3cameroon10 milesBy The New York TimesBut the election will do little to settle the uprising against Mr. Biya in Cameroon\u2019s two English-speaking regions, contiguous areas along the Nigerian border. Turnout in them is expected to be extremely low \u2014 largely because few people are left to vote. In some areas, locals officials estimate more than 90 percent of residents have fled.Communities like Ekona, a small town near a dormant rubber plantation, have been completely abandoned. Burned homes, crushed tin shacks that housed businesses and a blackened beer truck attest to the fierce battles here. Many of the concrete homes and stores along the road were riddled with large bullet holes.Ekona had been a flash point of fighting. A military captain blamed separatists for the damage, accusing them of lashing out at residents who didn\u2019t respect their calls to create a \u201cghost town,\u201d by abandoning the streets and staying home. But local news reports offered a much different explanation: a gun battle between separatists and security forces in June that sent residents escaping into the forest.English-speaking areas make up a fifth of the population, and with their palm oil, rubber and banana plantations they are a significant contributor to Cameroon\u2019s economy. Most of those operations are now closed because of the violence.The protests were part of a broad sense of marginalization that had been mounting since the post-World War I era, when the League of Nations appointed France and England as joint trustees of what was then German Kamerun. Colonialists pushed their own cultures on each region.Though the nation officially recognizes both languages, Mr. Biya, who governs from the French-speaking capital of Yaound\u00e9, has concentrated power and resources in Francophone areas, while people in Anglophone regions complain bitterly about unpaved roads and a lack of other infrastructure.The campaign posters of Mr. Biya plastered across the country and T-shirts handed out on street corners only reinforce the gulf between the two sides. In a nod to his experience, one of his campaign slogans is \u201cThe Power of Experience.\u201d But for English-speaking voters, the posters translate the slogan awkwardly, saying \u201cThe Force of Experience\u201d instead \u2014 an ominous echo of the violence being waged in English-speaking areas.\u201cTo make that kind of mistake,\u201d sighed Derick Woteva Wambo, the chief in a neighborhood in Buea, an English-speaking city. \u201cOh, this whole country.\u201dMr. Wambo estimated that only about 10,000 of Buea\u2019s 200,000 residents remain in the city, a normally quaint mountainside area where the violence has been unrelenting. Many fled after episodes like one Mr. Wambo witnessed last week.At 6:30 a.m. on Sept. 27, he said he was called to a home where he found the bodies of six men strung across a living room, some limp across chairs and one lying by a door as though he was trying to escape. Another body had already been taken to the morgue.Before they died, the men were having a party, smoking marijuana in the early morning hours and making noise, Mr. Wambo said. He said security forces heard the racket and executed them after deciding they were separatists, who are rumored to be heavy smokers. One of the dead included a neighbor who also heard the noise and decided to investigate, he said.Mr. Wambo called Buea \u201cparadise\u201d compared with what is happening in smaller villages. He says he has visited them to find rotting corpses and residents terrified that their young men will be mistaken for fighters and killed.Mr. Biya\u2019s government says the separatists are terrorists and has refused to open any dialogue with them.As for human rights abuses by government security forces, Issa Tchiroma Bakary, the communications minister, said that officials had been investigating the allegations they hear about.\u201cIt is unacceptable to commit a crime and unlawful killing today, tomorrow or after tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cNo army in the world is immune against misbehavior in a handful of its elements.\u201dSeparatists in some areas, including the English-speaking city of Bamenda, have blocked roads by felling trees and destroying bridges in an attempt to thwart soldiers from what is expected to be a major offensive. But the actions have also trapped civilians who are desperate to flee.Some others don\u2019t want to leave. One young man selling fruit on the streets of Buea this week said he knew his age alone made him a target.\u201cIf I die, I want to die in my own home,\u201d he said.Another man who fled to Yaound\u00e9 said he had endured a series of atrocities before finally giving up and packing his family of four into his brother\u2019s living room. Eleven people are now jammed into the small apartment, where he has hung a poster of numbers for his 4-year-old daughter. She has forgotten how to count to 10 after being out of school for so long.In Mile 16, schools have been closed for two years. The man, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of being targeted, said he had repeatedly run into roadblocks from separatists and shakedowns from soldiers who came to homes and helped themselves to laptops, televisions and cash. They even took soda without paying from a 12-year-old girl running a small store near his office, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re working for you,\u201d he said they told her. It was a small thing, but he was outraged.Then he saw a body floating down a nearby stream, and that of a soldier at a traffic circle.But what finally pushed him to escape was the aftermath of gunfire as soldiers, shooting wildly, chased two men on motorcycles. One of the bullets entered his neighbor\u2019s living room window and struck and killed a teenage boy watching television.When asked if he was going to vote Sunday, the man\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cFor what?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been voting for years and the results have never changed.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: This Year\u2019s Stock Gains Are Wiped Out", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMatt Phillips of the NYT explains what\u2019s driving the rout:Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.Either way, optimists may find solace in U.S. futures markets trading up slightly this morning, which hints at a brighter start for the day.More from Matt Rosenberg and Maggie Haberman of the NYT:China\u2019s effort is a 21st-century version of what officials there have been doing for many decades, which is trying to influence American leaders by cultivating an informal network of prominent businesspeople and academics who can be sold on ideas and policy prescriptions and then carry them to the White House. The difference now is that China, through its eavesdropping on Mr. Trump\u2019s calls, has a far clearer idea of who carries the most influence with the president, and what arguments tend to work.Combined with the eavesdropping is a lobbying effort by Beijing involving close Trump friends like Steve Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group and Steve Wynn, the former casino magnate. One U.S. official told the NYT that the Chinese were pushing for those friends to persuade Mr. Trump to sit down with President Xi Jinping of China as often as possible.The profit will help stabilize Tesla\u2019s finances. But the question now is whether the automaker can continue this success. It has struggled to deliver cars to customers, and it hasn\u2019t yet rolled out its long-promised $35,000 Model 3. More from Mr. Boudette on what could yet happen:If sales falter, the company could quickly find itself in a financial squeeze. It has to make bond payments of $230 million in November and $920 million in March. It can use stock for the second payment but only if its share price is above $360. At the same time, Tesla hopes to build a factory in China, which will require hundreds of millions of dollars in capital expenses.The suit, built on three years of investigations, does not charge the company with creating climate change. But it claims that the company essentially kept two sets of books when accounting for the effects of global warming: publicly, it claimed to be ready for stringent regulations, while internally it discounted potential costs of climate policies, prosecutors said. Executives as senior as Rex Tillerson, the former Exxon C.E.O. who later became President Trump\u2019s secretary of state, \u201cknew for years\u201d about the practice, the complaint said.An Exxon spokesman dismissed the lawsuit as \u201cbaseless.\u201d But as the NYT points out, New York attorneys general have had success bringing shareholder fraud lawsuits before, aided by the state\u2019s sweeping Martin Act.At stake isn\u2019t just hundreds of millions of dollars in punishment, but also a reputation that Exxon has tried to shape as a global leader on climate change issues.That starts with cars, said Mr. Khosrowshahi: \u201cIf there\u2019s one big goal for Uber, it\u2019s to replace car ownership.\u201d But Uber is also betting on bike and scooter rentals, food delivery, aircraft, and drones. The goal, he said, is to develop four or five multibillion-dollar businesses.That will come at a cost. Uber is at least a few years away from making money on ride-hailing, and investing in new technologies will require more cash. The company says revenue from mature markets is helping cover costs elsewhere, but prospective investors in its forthcoming I.P.O. will decide if that\u2019s enough to make a bet on its vision.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

But behind the drunken antics at the Deni Ute Muster, a network of friendship is lifting awareness of mental health issues.Supported byDENILIQUIN, Australia \u2014 It\u2019s been called the most debauched outdoor party in Australia: a wild, rollicking weekend where rural masculinity is on display and beer and banter flow endlessly.But for the Thompsons, the event carries more weight and meaning. They first went to the party, the Deni Ute Muster, three years ago, not long after losing their son, Bryan, to suicide.Bryan\u2019s mother, Lyn Thompson, 54, said she just knew it was his kind of festival. She pulled some faded pictures from her wallet, showing a son who had been eager to grow up, she said \u2014 a tall, 24-year-old bricklayer raising three children in small-town Australia with a heavy burden of responsibility.\u201cWhen we\u2019re here, he\u2019s with us,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re anywhere he\u2019s with us. But especially here.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not just a music festival,\u201d said Vicky Lowry, the Deni Ute Muster\u2019s general manager. \u201cIt is a celebration of rural Australia, it brings it all together.\u201dThat Aussie ideal was on display even before the festivities officially started as young men arrived in utes crammed with camping gear and beer, honking, whooping and waving from the windows.By last Friday morning, the area was blanketed with dust as utes skidded around in circles, with judges awarding points for skill and crowd reaction. Among the fans was a group of young men and women from a rural part of the state of Victoria. They had made bets on how many children would be conceived at the muster. \u201cI was being nice and said a thousand this year,\u201d said Karly Mitchell, 20.Many of their fathers were prone to bottling their emotions, they said, but among themselves there was a greater awareness of mental health issues. And technology, they said, was essential in their support networks.For some, the kind of communication fostered by internet access is hard to come by. At a bull-riding pen where young cowboys in bright shirts and white hats greased their ropes, I met Kurt Jamison, 24, who said he lived at a remote, 1,600-acre cattle station where until recently, there was no Wi-Fi. Sometimes, he said, he would go two weeks without seeing another person.\u201cYou end up talking to yourself,\u201d he said, as he leaned on the white gate bordering the bullpen. \u201cYou talk to your dogs.\u201dFor a few months last year, he said his depression worsened and he began drinking to cope with loneliness. But he said he was used to hiding his feelings. \u201cEven at school I was the school clown \u2014 but inside I was hating it,\u201d he said.\u201cI just messaged him back saying, \u2018Mate, everything\u2019s going to be all right,\u2019\u201d he said, a beer in hand. He said he stayed in touch with the man, just to see how things are going.\u201cThey just think we\u2019re all ferals,\u201d he said, referring to people who saw the festival as nothing more than a rowdy beerfest. \u201cBut really, you come here, it\u2019s just a good atmosphere. It\u2019s lovely.\u201dThe festival\u2019s endurance may lie in its adaptability. In the last few years, it has leaned toward being more family focused, inviting a wider scope of musicians and providing more activities. It has also limited the amount of alcohol allowed in and is now working more closely with the local police.\u201cWe\u2019ve had to evolve and move with the times,\u201d said Ms. Lowry, the festival\u2019s general manager.Many of the farmers who attended looked pleased, though in some cases the openness seemed limited to the muster itself. Feelings of discontent were evident among the crowd, which was overwhelmingly white. More than a few people had tags on their hats with a pointed message: \u201cOur land, our country, our way.\u201d In some conversations, pride and struggle had a way of edging into populist nationalism.\u201cThis is the worst season of drought we\u2019ve had for a long time. How many nations overseas have offered aid to our farmers?\u201d said Jamie Heyde, an ex-serviceman with a bear tattoo on his arm and an Amazon Kindle on his thigh. \u201cYou don\u2019t sit there and help someone else out if your footing is crumbling beneath you,\u201d he added.Mr. Heyde, who said he voted for Senator Pauline Hanson \u2014 Australia\u2019s main right-wing populist politician \u2014 said that he does not have a problem with immigration. But immigrants should be aware that they are \u201cAustralian first and foremost,\u201d he said.Later that night, Ms. Underwood, the American country star, sang of cowboys, mothers, love and land. For those at the show, just being with so many people from similar backgrounds seemed to be a relief.There were no cows to be milked and no sheep to be shorn, no drought to worry over. Thousands of people roamed the ute paddock. Dozens of fires sent up black smoke as men revved their utes until they backfired.More quietly, men and women in scuffed jeans could be seen taking pictures of the sunset and offering each other beers. They cheered as a woman in a pink vest, who produced a pair of bagpipes, began playing \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d\u201cThis is my main family. This is a family section to me,\u201d Rhys Martini, 24, said hoarsely as he stood in front of his ute, which had a row of bras across the bumper. \u201cReal brothers and sisters here.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Fujimori Is Ordered Back to Prison in Peru, Angering Supporters", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLIMA, Peru \u2014 Alberto Fujimori, the former Peruvian dictator imprisoned for human rights abuses but then pardoned last year, was ordered back to prison on Wednesday, reigniting debate over the fate of one of the region\u2019s most contentious figures.Human rights advocates hailed the ruling, but Mr. Fujimori\u2019s defiant supporters and his politically powerful daughter, Keiko, gathered outside his house on Wednesday to condemn it.\u201cThis is persecution against my family,\u201d Ms. Fujimori said.It was the latest dramatic turn for Mr. Fujimori, 80, who ruled as a dictator in the 1990s after suspending the Constitution, only to land in a prison cell when he tried to stage a political comeback in the early 2000s.He was freed last December, but his fate was reversed again on Wednesday, with the Supreme Court issuing orders for his arrest \u201cso he would be returned to penitentiary,\u201d according to a statement released on Twitter.Miguel P\u00e9rez Arroyo, a lawyer for Mr. Fujimori, told Peruvian television that Mr. Fujimori was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the decision but would comply while filing an appeal.By early evening, Mr. Fujimori had been taken to a hospital in Lima, the capital, where authorities had arrived with orders to arrest him.The ruling was the latest episode in a drama that has captivated the nation since Mr. Fujimori\u2019s pardon late last year, which brought back memories of his dictatorship and played a part in the toppling of a president this year.Mr. Fujimori had been sentenced in 2009 to a 25-year term for rights abuses that included the killing of more than two dozen people by a military death squad that prosecutors said Mr. Fujimori had created. Last December, President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned Mr. Fujimori on medical grounds.The announcement took Peru by surprise as Mr. Kuczynski was not an ally of the ex-president. But he was facing an impeachment threat led by the former president\u2019s daughter, Ms. Fujimori, who held a seat in Congress, leading many to see the pardon as part of a deal for the president\u2019s survival.But the move backfired as victims\u2019 groups organized protests, and the United Nations condemned the release. By March, Ms. Fujimori led another push to oust Mr. Kuczynski amid a corruption scandal, and the president resigned.The former dictator, meanwhile, had remained a free man.Francisco Sober\u00f3n, the director of the Association for Human Rights, a Peruvian group, applauded the court\u2019s decision to put Mr. Fujimori back in jail.\u201cIt\u2019s a great achievement for the families after 26 years of struggling for justice that was cut short by that terrible pardon,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an encouragement for justice in Peru,\u201d he said, describing the system as in a state of crisis because of widespread corruption.Victims groups had previously sought a reversal of the pardon, bringing a case before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights this year. The court, in turn, sent the case back to Peru\u2019s government, asking it to examine whether the pardon was legal.An\u00edbal Quiroga, a law professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, said that even though the president can pardon criminals, the Supreme Court had a strong case for overruling Mr. Fujimori\u2019s pardon. Peru may have run afoul of international treaties by freeing someone of Mr. Fujimori\u2019s stature who was convicted of human rights violations, he said.While Peru has been known for a growing economy and popular tourist sites, Mr. Fujimori\u2019s release was a reminder of a more bitter era that many in the country would rather forget.The son of Japanese immigrants, Mr. Fujimori was elected in 1990 as a political outsider at a time when the Shining Path and the T\u00fapac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, left-wing rebel groups, challenged the military and engaged in terror campaigns that left around 70,000 people dead. Hyperinflation was racking Peru\u2019s economy.Claiming that Congress was incapable of taking on either threat, Mr. Fujimori suspended the Constitution and ruled as an autocrat. While he eventually restored laws and was re-elected in 1995, his government came increasingly under suspicion for corruption, attacks on political opponents and massacres of civilians. After resigning in 2000, he fled to Japan.His 2009 trial exposed some of the darkest days of the dictatorship. The court found that Mr. Fujimori had created a death squad in the 1990s that had murdered 15 people at a neighborhood gathering in Lima and another 10 who were kidnapped and whose bodies were later burned. Among the dead was an 8-year-old boy.Despite the conviction, Mr. Fujimori and his political family remain popular among many Peruvians for having defeated the Shining Path.His daughter, Ms. Fujimori, wields vast power in the Congress, where her party has the largest number of seats. Mart\u00edn Vizcarra, the president who took over after Mr. Kuczynski\u2019s resignation, has yet to establish himself as a powerful force.Fernando Tuesta, a political scientist in Lima, said that Ms. Fujimori\u2019s political star continues to rise and that she will likely use her aging father\u2019s imprisonment as a rallying cry.\u201cI think that she is going to take this to the streets in the next few days to boost her candidates\u201d in coming elections, Mr. Tuesta said. \u201cThey will take advantage of this.\u201dAndrea Zarate reported from Lima, Peru, and Nicholas Casey from Medell\u00edn, Colombia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Brazil\u2019s Markets Have Surged on Hope of Bolsonaro Victory. Can He Deliver?", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byS\u00c3O PAULO, Brazil \u2014 Looking at Brazil\u2019s rallying stock market and stronger currency, it might seem as if Jair Bolsonaro, the right-wing presidential candidate favored by investors, had already won and the country was bouncing back from its painful recession.Mr. Bolsonaro has a substantial lead over his left-wing rival, Fernando Haddad, in Sunday\u2019s election.\u201cThe financial market is deluding itself with the promise of a liberal economic program\u201d from Mr. Bolsonaro, Mr. Schwartsman said.Part of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s appeal lies not in what he stands for, but in what he stands against.This election has effectively become, for investors and for many Brazilians, a referendum on Mr. Haddad\u2019s Workers\u2019 Party, or PT. It governed Brazil through a boom-and-bust cycle from 2003 to 2016. Many Brazilians blame the PT for the country\u2019s economic decline \u2014 and Mr. Bolsonaro was remarkably effective in presenting himself as the leftist party\u2019s polar opposite.\u201cIf the markets are a little apprehensive about Bolsonaro, they should feel completely insecure when it comes to the PT,\u201d said Gustavo Bebianno, the president of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s Social Liberal Party.The vote comes as the nation, home to the world\u2019s eighth-largest economy, is struggling to emerge from a brutal economic downturn. That slump \u2014 worsened by a political crisis and a widespread corruption scandal \u2014 has left nearly 13 million people unemployed.Without swift and largely unpopular measures \u2014 including pension reform \u2014 the fiscal deficit and public debt could balloon out of control and push the country back into recession.But Mr. Bolsonaro is not your average business-friendly conservative. With his abrasive rhetoric, shoot-first approach to fighting crime and socially conservative agenda, he is more often compared with leaders like President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines than with traditional free-trade minded fiscal conservatives.When asked about the economy, Mr. Bolsonaro professes ignorance and points to his would-be finance minister, Paulo Guedes, a University of Chicago-educated and market-friendly economist handpicked to reassure the business elite.Central to Mr. Guedes\u2019 ambitious plan for the economy is to put every public company and property \u2014 including the state-run electricity giant Eletrobras and the giant oil company Petrobras \u2014 on the auction block to raise over $400 billion.That, he argues, would reduce public debt while crucial pension reform is hammered out.But when asked about the idea during a recent television interview, Mr. Bolsonaro torpedoed it.\u201cAre you going to privatize in exchange for anybody\u2019s money?\u201d he said. \u201cChina isn\u2019t buying in Brazil, China is buying Brazil! Are you going to leave our energy in the hands of the Chinese?\u201dDuring his seven terms as a lawmaker, Mr. Bolsonaro voted against privatizations, calling the landmark breakup and sale of the telecommunications monopoly a \u201cbarbarity.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro, a former army captain, has defended Brazil\u2019s military dictatorship and alienated many voters with incendiary attacks on women, blacks and gays. Nonetheless, he handily won the first round of voting, in part by positioning himself as the wrecking ball willing to demolish the political establishment Brazilians were so furious with after years of corruption scandals and economic turmoil.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s embrace by investors came late in the game, with influential groups like the agribusiness lobby endorsing him just days before the first round of elections.As the race narrowed, markets sided with Mr. Bolsonaro over Mr. Haddad, who became the Workers\u2019 Party candidate after the courts deemed the former president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, the party\u2019s de facto leader, ineligible to run because he was convicted of money laundering and corruption. He is serving a 12-year sentence.Many Brazilians hold the Workers\u2019 Party responsible not only for the multibillion-dollar bribery scheme uncovered by a corruption investigation known as Lava Jato, or Carwash, but also for the deep recession that began under Mr. da Silva\u2019s chosen successor, former president Dilma Rousseff.Vanessa Gomes, a real estate broker in S\u00e3o Paulo, is among those who want a change.\u201cWe know what 14 years of the PT brought \u2014 high interest rates and high unemployment,\u201d she said. \u201cProperties have been sitting on the market for two years. Bolsonaro is going to change that. I\u2019ve already got clients just waiting for elections to be over to buy.\u201dStill, experts are divided over what \u201cBolsonomics\u201d will look like.\u201cI think it\u2019s a massive risk,\u201d said Eduardo Mufarej, a former investment banker who founded the nonpartisan organization RenovaBR, which sought to get political outsiders elected this year.\u201cMarkets are seeing the glass half full now,\u201d Mr. Mufarej said, adding that 2019 will be a crucial year.With lower interest rates, low inflation and a backlog of investments coming to market once elections are over, the economy will almost certainly rebound, Mr. Mufarej predicted. But it might not last long, he said.\u201cIt will be a honeymoon,\u201d he said.But, he added, \u201cUnless structural measures are implemented, like pension reform and tax reform, 2020 will be a completely different story.\u201dAnalysts warn that without drastic measures debt could reach unsustainable levels in the next two years, leaving the government unable to finance itself and pushing the economy back into recession.In Brazil, workers on average retire at 55, earning 70 percent of their final salary. Social security accounts for a third of all government spending, which has contributed to record fiscal deficits. That makes pension reform among the thornier challenges the new president will face.While Mr. Guedes has repeatedly vowed to push an unpopular measure through Congress, Mr. Bolsonaro has again sent mixed signals.\u201cWe can\u2019t penalize those who have already acquired rights,\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro said of draft reform in a recent interview. \u201cWe can play with things, we have ideas and proposals in that sense, but no one will be penalized.\u201dMarkets are optimistic his tune will change once the campaign is over.\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t the policy orientation,\u201d said Chris Garman, a Brazil expert at Eurasia Group, pointing out that Mr. Bolsonaro spoke to dozens of economists over the last year, looking for someone with the right liberal credentials. \u201cThe problem is, how much can they get done?\u201dIn pushing through any changes, Mr. Bolsonaro will be up against a fragmented Congress with 30 political parties. He does not have a track record of building coalitions, and has said he will not partake in the traditional horse-trading required to pass legislation in Brazil.Mr. Mufarej, the former investment banker, said Mr. Bolsonaro could lose the chance to act if he doesn\u2019t expand his inner circle beyond mostly military men and entice competent and experienced professionals to critical jobs.To Eurasia\u2019s Mr. Garman, the risk is ending up with watered-down measures.\u201cWe will see compromises along the way,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get pension reform done in a year, we could see a real blowout.\u201dManuela Andreoni contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Could Hold Back a Democratic Wave? Economy, Confidence, Independence", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn some tight House races the local economy is the most pressing concern. In Virginia, Minn., some residents blame trade deals championed by Democratic administrations, and environmental regulations, for the closing of plants and shuttered storefronts.YARDLEY, Pa. \u2014 Sitting at her pumpkin-decorated dining room table, Kristen Donnelly ticked off her top political concerns: pay equity for women, gun control and anti-immigrant sentiment. (Her husband of five years has a green card.)As for the president? \u201cI would never vote for Trump,\u201d Ms. Donnelly declared.\u201cHe\u2019s definitely on the moderate side,\u201d Ms. Donnelly said, praising his support for the nuclear family, the police department and \u201cthe idea that America as a nation is good, and that we can continue to protect the American experiment as it stands.\u201dLost in all the talk about a Democratic blue wave is a set of sober reality checks \u2014 from the quantifiable to the emotional \u2014 that may help Republicans reduce their losses, and possibly even retain their 23-seat majority.In many neighborhoods with key House races, daily life is pretty good. Unemployment is at a five-decade low. Confidence is spilling over among consumers and businesses. The economy is on track to grow at its fastest pace in years.Those developments benefit people whom Democrats have targeted, too: Women in upscale, right-of-center, white suburbs where Hillary Clinton edged out a victory; Trump voters in struggling rural and industrial areas with deep Democratic roots; and minorities in racially diverse metro areas.While the president looms large over this election, drawing out both opponents and supporters, local issues like school funding or mining are in the forefront of some races. In others, Republican incumbents\u2019 blend of personality and policy positions has won over independents and moderates.In recent months, The New York Times interviewed dozens of voters in battleground House districts, and spoke at length with three of them about the nuances of the races in their areas, how politics affected their lives, and their views and concerns about the midterms. These voters have a history of crossing party lines in their districts \u2014 one in Pennsylvania, one in Minnesota and one in California \u2014 and discussed what would ultimately persuade them to vote Democrat or Republican.Ms. Donnelly in Bucks County, for instance, noted Mr. Fitzpatrick\u2019s independent streak. \u201cI have had personal interactions where I\u2019ve told him he\u2019s dead wrong,\u201d she said, \u201cand he\u2019s been very respectful.\u201dKristen Donnelly, a registered independent, at her home in Yardley, Pa., early this month.\u201cWhen you look at the underlying political environment in this district, you would expect the Democrat to be ahead,\u201d Patrick Murray, the institute\u2019s director, said. \u201cBut Fitzpatrick has been able to overcome this with a solid reputation among his constituents.\u201dMs. Donnelly said she is willing to give Mr. Fitzpatrick the benefit of the doubt because \u201che has earned my trust.\u201dSo when the Republican candidate Pete Stauber first asked Larry Cuffe, the mayor of the small town of Virginia, for his support at the town\u2019s Land of Loon festival last summer, Mr. Cuffe turned him down. \u201cI was already committed to Rick Nolan,\u201d the Democratic incumbent, he said.Then in February, Mr. Nolan dropped out of the race. Within hours, Mr. Cuffe, 65, said he was on the phone, telling Mr. Stauber: \u201cI\u2019m behind you 100 percent.\u201d Three other mayors in nearby towns also threw Mr. Stauber their support.For Mr. Cuffe, a former sheriff and U.P.S. delivery man, the switch wasn\u2019t hard, and not just because he knew Mr. Stauber as a police lieutenant in Duluth, or remembered him playing hockey with a Detroit Red Wings farm team.Like many of his friends and neighbors, Mr. Cuffe voted for Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, but had been drifting away from the Democratic Party.Trade deals that Democratic administrations had championed brought in cheap foreign steel that led to the closing of a local taconite plant and strings of shuttered storefronts. Environmentalists in the party battled the timber and mining concerns that provide many of the struggling region\u2019s best-paid jobs. \u201cIt\u2019s our way of life,\u201d Mr. Cuffe said.He and others throughout the Iron Range were won over in 2016 by Mr. Trump\u2019s outspoken hostility to existing trade deals, support of mining and America First appeals. They helped him become the first Republican presidential candidate since Herbert Hoover to win the district. Mr. Nolan, elected by a wide margin in 2012, hung onto his seat by just 2,010 votes.Mr. Cuffe said that if he had not already promised Mr. Stauber his support, \u201cI would have considered voting for Radinovich.\u201dStill, he noted: \u201cMining is the big issue, and I don\u2019t see that in the Democratic platform.\u201dLocal issues play less of a role in Orange County, Calif., where candidates are courting minority voters.Once a synonym for conservatism, this wealthy overwhelmingly white region is now one-fifth Asian and one-third Latino. The shift has given Democrats hope of winning one or more of the four congressional seats held by Republicans in the county.Sal Rasheed, who lives with his wife and three children in the 45th Congressional District, is part of that demographic transformation.

{"Headline": "Paul Volcker, at 91, Sees \u2018a Hell of a Mess in Every Direction\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDealBookThe former Fed chairman, whose memoir will be published this month, had a feisty take on the state of politics and government during an interview.Paul Volcker, wearing a blue sweatsuit and black dress socks, stretched out on a recliner in the den of his Upper East Side apartment on a Sunday afternoon. His lanky 6-foot-7 frame extended beyond the end of the chair\u2019s leg rest. He added an ottoman to rest his feet.\u201cI\u2019m not good,\u201d said Mr. Volcker, 91, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who came to prominence after he used shockingly high interest rates to help end the runaway inflation of the late 1970s and early \u201980s. Long one of finance\u2019s wise men, he has been sick for several months. But he would rather not talk about himself. Instead, Mr. Volcker wants to talk about the country, the economy and the government. And if he had seemed lethargic when I arrived, he turned lively in his laments: \u201cWe\u2019re in a hell of a mess in every direction,\u201d he said.Hundreds of books surrounded Mr. Volcker \u2014 filling shelves and piled high on virtually every flat surface \u2014 as did pink pages of The Financial Times, folded into origami. \u201cRespect for government, respect for the Supreme Court, respect for the president, it\u2019s all gone,\u201d he said. \u201cEven respect for the Federal Reserve. \u201cAnd it\u2019s really bad. At least the military still has all the respect. But I don\u2019t know, how can you run a democracy when nobody believes in the leadership of the country?\u201d\u201cI had no intention of writing a book, but there was something that kind of was irritating me,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m really worried about this governance thing.\u201d\u201cThere is no force on earth that can stand up effectively, year after year, against the thousands of individuals and hundreds of millions of dollars in the Washington swamp aimed at influencing the legislative and electoral process,\u201d he wrote in the book.Reagan \u201cdidn\u2019t say a word,\u201d Mr. Volcker wrote. \u201cInstead Baker delivered a message: \u2018The president is ordering you not to raise interest rates before the election.\u2019\u201d Mr. Volcker wasn\u2019t planning to raise rates at the time. The book is not limited to tales of the past, however. It addresses current policy, like the 2 percent inflation target that has become the goal of the Federal Reserve.With a laugh, he told me that he believed the policy was driven by fears of deflation. \u201cAnd we haven\u2019t had any deflation in this country for 90 years!\u201dBut there is something more worrisome affecting policy than fear, he told me. Money.Over the din of traffic outside an open window, Mr. Volcker hoarsely sounded an alarm on the power it has to shape our culture and our politics.\u201cThe central issue is we\u2019re developing into a plutocracy,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an enormous number of enormously rich people that have convinced themselves that they\u2019re rich because they\u2019re smart and constructive. And they don\u2019t like government, and they don\u2019t like to pay taxes.\u201d Washington, when he arrived, \u201cwas a city filled with bureaucrats,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t make them bad.\u201d At the time, civil servants \u2014 like his father, the township manager of Teaneck, N.J. \u2014 were respected. \u201cI grew up in a world in which good government was a good term,\u201d he said.Schools like the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton, he said, have failed to educate a new generation of civil servants. He said they no longer taught governing but policy \u2014 a shift that he contended allowed them to hold forums and discussions with generals and under secretaries. \u201cRich guys,\u201d he said, \u201clike to go.\u201d He called it \u201chobnobbing wholesale.\u201d \u201cThey can argue war and peace and poverty and everything else,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you go to a school of public policy, you\u2019re not learning how to run the goddamn government. You\u2019re learning how to debate political issues.\u201d Unlike President Barack Obama, who invited Mr. Volcker to consult on economic and regulatory policy \u2014 and asked him if he would be willing to be Treasury secretary, he said \u2014 this White House hasn\u2019t called him. Even so, he has met Mr. Trump twice, both times before he took office.The other was an unsuccessful attempt by Mr. Volcker to get Mr. Trump to use \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d to raise money for a charitable organization. \u201cWe had a very nice lunch, and he said, \u2018Interesting idea,\u2019 but put me off otherwise,\u201d Mr. Volcker said.Mr. Volcker is no great fan of the president, but he acknowledged that Mr. Trump had cannily recognized the economic worries of blue-collar workers. Mr. Trump \u201cseized upon some issues that the elite had ignored,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about that, in kind of an erratic way, but there it is.\u201d He wondered how many lectures and presentations he had sat through with economists \u201ctelling us open markets are wonderful, everybody benefits from open markets.\u201dToday, Mr. Volcker is already starting to worry about the next financial crisis. Asked about the stability of the banks, he said, \u201cThey\u2019re in a stronger position than they were, but the honest answer is I don\u2019t know how much they\u2019re manipulating.\u201dThat, he said, is the real challenge facing economic policymakers. \u201cEverybody talks about monetary policy,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the lesson of all this is we need better, stronger supervisory powers.\u201dEven as our conversation came to an end, Mr. Volcker looked as if he could keep talking for hours. I told him that, rather than look sick or depressed about the state of the world, he appeared energized. Or, I told him, that was at least the impression he left.\u201cLeave it that way,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Engaged in Suspect Tax Schemes as He Reaped Riches From His Father", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "The president has long sold himself as a self-made billionaire, but a Times investigation found that he received at least $413 million in today\u2019s dollars from his father\u2019s real estate empire, much of it through tax dodges in the 1990s.President Trump participated in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud, that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents, an investigation by The New York Times has found.Mr. Trump won the presidency proclaiming himself a self-made billionaire, and he has long insisted that his father, the legendary New York City builder Fred C. Trump, provided almost no financial help.But The Times\u2019s investigation, based on a vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records, reveals that Mr. Trump received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father\u2019s real estate empire, starting when he was a toddler and continuing to this day.Much of this money came to Mr. Trump because he helped his parents dodge taxes. He and his siblings set up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents, records and interviews show. Records indicate that Mr. Trump helped his father take improper tax deductions worth millions more. He also helped formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents\u2019 real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns, sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings.These maneuvers met with little resistance from the Internal Revenue Service, The Times found. The president\u2019s parents, Fred and Mary Trump, transferred well over $1 billion in wealth to their children, which could have produced a tax bill of at least $550 million under the 55 percent tax rate then imposed on gifts and inheritances.The Trumps paid a total of $52.2 million, or about 5 percent, tax records show.The president declined repeated requests over several weeks to comment for this article. But a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Charles J. Harder, provided a written statement on Monday, one day after The Times sent a detailed description of its findings. \u201cThe New York Times\u2019s allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100 percent false, and highly defamatory,\u201d Mr. Harder said. \u201cThere was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone. The facts upon which The Times bases its false allegations are extremely inaccurate.\u201dMr. Harder sought to distance Mr. Trump from the tax strategies used by his family, saying the president had delegated those tasks to relatives and tax professionals. \u201cPresident Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever with these matters,\u201d he said. \u201cThe affairs were handled by other Trump family members who were not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law.\u201dThe president\u2019s brother, Robert Trump, issued a statement on behalf of the Trump family:\u201cOur dear father, Fred C. Trump, passed away in June 1999. Our beloved mother, Mary Anne Trump, passed away in August 2000. All appropriate gift and estate tax returns were filed, and the required taxes were paid. Our father\u2019s estate was closed in 2001 by both the Internal Revenue Service and the New York State tax authorities, and our mother\u2019s estate was closed in 2004. Our family has no other comment on these matters that happened some 20 years ago, and would appreciate your respecting the privacy of our deceased parents, may God rest their souls.\u201dThe Times\u2019s findings raise new questions about Mr. Trump\u2019s refusal to release his income tax returns, breaking with decades of practice by past presidents. According to tax experts, it is unlikely that Mr. Trump would be vulnerable to criminal prosecution for helping his parents evade taxes, because the acts happened too long ago and are past the statute of limitations. There is no time limit, however, on civil fines for tax fraud.The findings are based on interviews with Fred Trump\u2019s former employees and advisers and more than 100,000 pages of documents describing the inner workings and immense profitability of his empire. They include documents culled from public sources \u2014 mortgages and deeds, probate records, financial disclosure reports, regulatory records and civil court files.The investigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records \u2014 bank statements, financial audits, accounting ledgers, cash disbursement reports, invoices and canceled checks. Most notably, the documents include more than 200 tax returns from Fred Trump, his companies and various Trump partnerships and trusts. While the records do not include the president\u2019s personal tax returns and reveal little about his recent business dealings at home and abroad, dozens of corporate, partnership and trust tax returns offer the first public accounting of the income he received for decades from various family enterprises.What emerges from this body of evidence is a financial biography of the 45th president fundamentally at odds with the story Mr. Trump has sold in his books, his TV shows and his political life. In Mr. Trump\u2019s version of how he got rich, he was the master dealmaker who broke free of his father\u2019s \u201ctiny\u201d outer-borough operation and parlayed a single $1 million loan from his father (\u201cI had to pay him back with interest!\u201d) into a $10 billion empire that would slap the Trump name on hotels, high-rises, casinos, airlines and golf courses the world over. In Mr. Trump\u2019s version, it was always his guts and gumption that overcame setbacks. Fred Trump was simply a cheerleader.\u201cI built what I built myself,\u201d Mr. Trump has said, a narrative that was long amplified by often-credulous coverage from news organizations, including The Times.Certainly a handful of journalists and biographers, notably Wayne Barrett, Gwenda Blair, David Cay Johnston and Timothy L. O\u2019Brien, have challenged this story, especially the claim of being worth $10 billion. They described how Mr. Trump piggybacked off his father\u2019s banking connections to gain a foothold in Manhattan real estate. They poked holes in his go-to talking point about the $1 million loan, citing evidence that he actually got $14 million. They told how Fred Trump once helped his son make a bond payment on an Atlantic City casino by buying $3.5 million in casino chips.But The Times\u2019s investigation of the Trump family\u2019s finances is unprecedented in scope and precision, offering the first comprehensive look at the inherited fortune and tax dodges that guaranteed Donald J. Trump a gilded life. The reporting makes clear that in every era of Mr. Trump\u2019s life, his finances were deeply intertwined with, and dependent on, his father\u2019s wealth.By age 3, Mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars from his father\u2019s empire. He was a millionaire by age 8. By the time he was 17, his father had given him part ownership of a 52-unit apartment building. Soon after Mr. Trump graduated from college, he was receiving the equivalent of $1 million a year from his father. The money increased with the years, to more than $5 million annually in his 40s and 50s.Fred Trump\u2019s real estate empire was not just scores of apartment buildings. It was also a mountain of cash, tens of millions of dollars in profits building up inside his businesses, banking records show. In one six-year span, from 1988 through 1993, Fred Trump reported $109.7 million in total income, now equivalent to $210.7 million. It was not unusual for tens of millions in Treasury bills and certificates of deposit to flow through his personal bank accounts each month.Fred Trump was relentless and creative in finding ways to channel this wealth to his children. He made Donald not just his salaried employee but also his property manager, landlord, banker and consultant. He gave him loan after loan, many never repaid. He provided money for his car, money for his employees, money to buy stocks, money for his first Manhattan offices and money to renovate those offices. He gave him three trust funds. He gave him shares in multiple partnerships. He gave him $10,000 Christmas checks. He gave him laundry revenue from his buildings.Much of his giving was structured to sidestep gift and inheritance taxes using methods tax experts described to The Times as improper or possibly illegal. Although Fred Trump became wealthy with help from federal housing subsidies, he insisted that it was manifestly unfair for the government to tax his fortune as it passed to his children. When he was in his 80s and beginning to slide into dementia, evading gift and estate taxes became a family affair, with Donald Trump playing a crucial role, interviews and newly obtained documents show.The line between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion is often murky, and it is constantly being stretched by inventive tax lawyers. There is no shortage of clever tax avoidance tricks that have been blessed by either the courts or the I.R.S. itself. The richest Americans almost never pay anything close to full freight. But tax experts briefed on The Times\u2019s findings said the Trumps appeared to have done more than exploit legal loopholes. They said the conduct described here represented a pattern of deception and obfuscation, particularly about the value of Fred Trump\u2019s real estate, that repeatedly prevented the I.R.S. from taxing large transfers of wealth to his children.\u201cThe theme I see here through all of this is valuations: They play around with valuations in extreme ways,\u201d said Lee-Ford Tritt, a University of Florida law professor and a leading expert in gift and estate tax law. \u201cThere are dramatic fluctuations depending on their purpose.\u201dThe manipulation of values to evade taxes was central to one of the most important financial events in Donald Trump\u2019s life. In an episode never before revealed, Mr. Trump and his siblings gained ownership of most of their father\u2019s empire on Nov. 22, 1997, a year and a half before Fred Trump\u2019s death. Critical to the complex transaction was the value put on the real estate. The lower its value, the lower the gift taxes. The Trumps dodged hundreds of millions in gift taxes by submitting tax returns that grossly undervalued the properties, claiming they were worth just $41.4 million.The same set of buildings would be sold off over the next decade for more than 16 times that amount.The most overt fraud was All County Building Supply & Maintenance, a company formed by the Trump family in 1992. All County\u2019s ostensible purpose was to be the purchasing agent for Fred Trump\u2019s buildings, buying everything from boilers to cleaning supplies. It did no such thing, records and interviews show. Instead All County siphoned millions of dollars from Fred Trump\u2019s empire by simply marking up purchases already made by his employees. Those millions, effectively untaxed gifts, then flowed to All County\u2019s owners \u2014 Donald Trump, his siblings and a cousin. Fred Trump then used the padded All County receipts to justify bigger rent increases for thousands of tenants.After this article was published on Tuesday, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance said the agency was \u201creviewing the allegations\u201d and \u201cvigorously pursuing all appropriate areas of investigation.\u201dAll told, The Times documented 295 streams of revenue that Fred Trump created over five decades to enrich his son. In most cases his four other children benefited equally. But over time, as Donald Trump careened from one financial disaster to the next, his father found ways to give him substantially more money, records show. Even so, in 1990, according to previously secret depositions, Mr. Trump tried to have his father\u2019s will rewritten in a way that Fred Trump, alarmed and angered, feared could result in his empire\u2019s being used to bail out his son\u2019s failing businesses.Of course, the story of how Donald Trump got rich cannot be reduced to handouts from his father. Before he became president, his singular achievement was building the brand of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire, a brand so potent it generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue through TV shows, books and licensing deals.Constructing that image required more than Fred Trump\u2019s money. Just as important were his son\u2019s preternatural marketing skills and always-be-closing competitive hustle. While Fred Trump helped finance the accouterments of wealth, Donald Trump, master self-promoter, spun them into a seductive narrative. Fred Trump\u2019s money, for example, helped build Trump Tower, the talisman of privilege that established his son as a major player in New York. But Donald Trump recognized and exploited the iconic power of Trump Tower as a primary stage for both \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d and his presidential campaign.The biggest payday he ever got from his father came long after Fred Trump\u2019s death. It happened quietly, without the usual Trumpian news conference, on May 4, 2004, when Mr. Trump and his siblings sold off the empire their father had spent 70 years assembling with the dream that it would never leave his family.Donald Trump\u2019s cut: $177.3 million, or $236.2 million in today\u2019s dollars.Early experience, cultivated connections and a wave of federal housing subsidies helped Fred Trump lay the foundation of his son\u2019s wealth.Before he turned 20, Fred Trump had already built and sold his first home. At age 35, he was building hundreds of houses a year in Brooklyn and Queens. By 45, he was building some of the biggest apartment complexes in the country.Aside from an astonishing work ethic \u2014 \u201cSleeping is a waste of time,\u201d he liked to say \u2014 the growth reflected his shrewd application of mass-production techniques. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle called him \u201cthe Henry Ford of the home-building industry.\u201d He would erect scaffolding a city block long so his masons, sometimes working a second shift under floodlights, could throw up a dozen rowhouses in a week. They sold for about $115,000 in today\u2019s dollars.By 1940, American Builder magazine was taking notice, devoting a spread to Fred Trump under the headline \u201cBiggest One-Man Building Show.\u201d The article described a swaggering lone-wolf character who paid for everything \u2014 wages, supplies, land \u2014 from a thick wad of cash he carried at all times, and whose only help was a secretary answering the phone in an office barely bigger than a parking space. \u201cHe is his own purchasing agent, cashier, paymaster, building superintendent, construction engineer and sales director,\u201d the article said.It wasn\u2019t that simple. Fred Trump had also spent years ingratiating himself with Brooklyn\u2019s Democratic machine, giving money, doing favors and making the sort of friends (like Abraham D. Beame, a future mayor) who could make life easier for a developer. He had also assembled a phalanx of plugged-in real estate lawyers, property appraisers and tax accountants who protected his interests.All these traits \u2014 deep experience, nimbleness, connections, a relentless focus on the efficient construction of homes for the middle class \u2014 positioned him perfectly to ride a growing wave of federal spending on housing. The wave took shape with the New Deal, grew during the World War II rush to build military housing and crested with the postwar imperative to provide homes for returning G.I.s. Fred Trump would become a millionaire many times over by making himself one of the nation\u2019s largest recipients of cheap government-backed building loans, according to Gwenda Blair\u2019s book \u201cThe Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President.\u201dThose same loans became the wellspring of Donald Trump\u2019s wealth. In the late 1940s, Fred Trump obtained roughly $26 million in federal loans to build two of his largest developments, Beach Haven Apartments, near Coney Island, Brooklyn, and Shore Haven Apartments, a few miles away. Then he set about making his children his landlords.As ground lease payments fattened his children\u2019s trusts, Fred Trump embarked on a far bigger transfer of wealth. Records obtained by The Times reveal how he began to build or buy apartment buildings in Brooklyn and Queens and then gradually, without public trace, transfer ownership to his children through a web of partnerships and corporations. In all, Fred Trump put up nearly $13 million in cash and mortgage debt to create a mini-empire within his empire \u2014 eight buildings with 1,032 apartments \u2014 that he would transfer to his children.The handover began just before Donald Trump\u2019s 16th birthday. On June 1, 1962, Fred Trump transferred a plot of land in Queens to a newly created corporation. While he would be its president, his children would be its owners, records show. Then he constructed a 52-unit building called Clyde Hall.It was easy money for the Trump children. Their father took care of everything. He bought the land, built the apartments and obtained the mortgages. His employees managed the building. The profits, meanwhile, went to his children. By the early 1970s, Fred Trump would execute similar transfers of the other seven buildings.The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.For Donald Trump, this meant a rapidly growing new source of income. When he was in high school, his cut of the profits was about $17,000 a year in today\u2019s dollars. His share exceeded $300,000 a year soon after he graduated from college.How Fred Trump transferred 1,032 apartments to his children without incurring hundreds of thousands of dollars in gift taxes is unclear. A review of property records for the eight buildings turned up no evidence that his children bought them outright. Financial records obtained by The Times reveal only that all of the shares in the partnerships and corporations set up to create the mini-empire shifted at some point from Fred Trump to his children. Yet his tax returns show he paid no gift taxes on seven of the buildings, and only a few thousand dollars on the eighth.That building, Sunnyside Towers, a 158-unit property in Queens, illustrates Fred Trump\u2019s catch-me-if-you-can approach with the I.R.S., which had repeatedly cited him for underpaying taxes in the 1950s and 1960s.Donald Trump went to work for his father after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. His father made him vice president of dozens of companies. This was also the moment Fred Trump telegraphed what had become painfully obvious to his family and employees: He did not consider his eldest son, Fred Trump Jr., a viable heir apparent.Fred Jr., seven and a half years older than Donald, had also worked for his father after college. It did not go well, relatives and former employees said in interviews. Fred Trump openly ridiculed him for being too nice, too soft, too lazy, too fond of drink. He frowned on his interests in flying and music, could not fathom why he cared so little for the family business. Donald, witness to his father\u2019s deepening disappointment, fashioned himself Fred Jr.\u2019s opposite \u2014 the brash tough guy with a killer instinct. His reward was to inherit his father\u2019s dynastic dreams.Fred Trump began taking steps that enriched Donald alone, introducing him to the charms of building with cheap government loans. In 1972, father and son formed a partnership to build a high-rise for the elderly in East Orange, N.J. Thanks to government subsidies, the partnership got a nearly interest-free $7.8 million loan that covered 90 percent of construction costs. Fred Trump paid the rest.But his son received most of the financial benefits, records show. On top of profit distributions and consulting fees, Donald Trump was paid to manage the building, though Fred Trump\u2019s employees handled day-to-day management. He also pocketed what tenants paid to rent air-conditioners. By 1975, Donald Trump\u2019s take from the building was today\u2019s equivalent of nearly $305,000 a year.Fred Trump also gave his son an extra boost through his investment, in the early 1970s, in the sprawling Starrett City development in Brooklyn, the largest federally subsidized housing project in the nation. The investment, which promised to generate huge tax write-offs, was tailor-made for Fred Trump; he would use Starrett City\u2019s losses to avoid taxes on profits from his empire.Fred Trump invested $5 million. A separate partnership established for his children invested $1 million more, showering tax breaks on the Trump children for decades to come. They helped Donald Trump avoid paying any federal income taxes at all in 1978 and 1979. But Fred Trump also deputized him to sell a sliver of his Starrett City shares, a sweetheart deal that generated today\u2019s equivalent of more than $1 million in \u201cconsulting fees.\u201dThe money from consulting and management fees, ground leases, the mini-empire and his salary all combined to make Donald Trump indisputably wealthy years before he sold his first Manhattan apartment. By 1975, when he was 29, he had collected nearly $9 million in today\u2019s dollars from his father, The Times found.Wealthy, yes. But a far cry from the image father and son craved for Donald Trump.Fred Trump would play a crucial role in building and carefully maintaining the myth of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire.\u201cHe is tall, lean and blond, with dazzling white teeth, and he looks ever so much like Robert Redford. He rides around town in a chauffeured silver Cadillac with his initials, DJT, on the plates. He dates slinky fashion models, belongs to the most elegant clubs and, at only 30 years of age, estimates that he is worth \u2018more than $200 million.\u2019\u201dIn the chauffeured Cadillac, Donald Trump took The Times\u2019s reporter on a tour of what he called his \u201cjobs.\u201d He told her about the Manhattan hotel he planned to convert into a Grand Hyatt (his father guaranteed the construction loan), and the Hudson River railroad yards he planned to develop (the rights were purchased by his father\u2019s company). He showed her \u201cour philanthropic endeavor,\u201d the high-rise for the elderly in East Orange (bankrolled by his father), and an apartment complex on Staten Island (owned by his father), and their \u201cflagship,\u201d Trump Village, in Brooklyn (owned by his father), and finally Beach Haven Apartments (owned by his father). Even the Cadillac was leased by his father.\u201cSo far,\u201d he boasted, \u201cI\u2019ve never made a bad deal.\u201dIt was a spectacular con, right down to the priceless moment when Mr. Trump confessed that he was \u201cpublicity shy.\u201d By claiming his father\u2019s wealth as his own, Donald Trump transformed his place in the world. A brash 30-year-old playboy worth more than $200 million proved irresistible to New York City\u2019s bankers, politicians and journalists.Yet for all the spin about cutting his own path in Manhattan, Donald Trump was increasingly dependent on his father. Weeks after The Times\u2019s profile ran, Fred Trump set up still more trusts for his children, seeding each with today\u2019s equivalent of $4.3 million. Even into the early 1980s, when he was already proclaiming himself one of America\u2019s richest men, Donald Trump remained on his father\u2019s payroll, drawing an annual salary of $260,000 in today\u2019s dollars.In theory, the money had to be repaid. In practice, records show, many of the loans were more like gifts. Some were interest-free and had no repayment schedule. Even when loans charged interest, Donald Trump frequently skipped payments.This previously unreported flood of loans highlights a clear pattern to Fred Trump\u2019s largess. When Donald Trump began expensive new projects, his father increased his help. In the late 1970s, when Donald Trump was converting the old Commodore Hotel into a Grand Hyatt, his father stepped up with a spigot of loans. Fred Trump did the same with Trump Tower in the early 1980s.In the mid-1980s, as Donald Trump made his first forays into Atlantic City, Fred Trump devised a plan that sharply increased the flow of money to his son.The plan involved the mini-empire \u2014 the eight buildings Fred Trump had transferred to his children. He converted seven of them into cooperatives, and helped his children convert the eighth. That meant inviting tenants to buy their apartments, generating a three-way windfall for Donald Trump and his siblings: from selling units, from renting unsold units and from collecting mortgage payments.In 1982, Donald Trump made today\u2019s equivalent of about $380,000 from the eight buildings. As the conversions continued and Fred Trump\u2019s employees sold off more units, his son\u2019s share of profits jumped, records show. By 1987, with the conversions completed, his son was making today\u2019s equivalent of $4.5 million a year off the eight buildings.Fred Trump made one other structural change to his empire that produced a big new source of revenue for Donald Trump and his siblings. He made them his bankers.The Times could find no evidence that the Trump children had to come up with money of their own to buy their father\u2019s mortgages. Most were purchased from Fred Trump\u2019s banks by trusts and partnerships that he set up and seeded with money.Co-op sales, mortgage payments, ground leases \u2014 Fred Trump was a master at finding ways to enrich his children in general and Donald Trump in particular. Some ways were like slow-moving creeks. Others were rushing streams. A few were geysers. But as the decades passed they all joined into one mighty river of money. By 1990, The Times found, Fred Trump, the ultimate silent partner, had quietly transferred today\u2019s equivalent of at least $46.2 million to his son.Donald Trump took on a mien of invincibility. The stock market crashed in 1987 and the economy cratered. But he doubled down thanks in part to Fred Trump\u2019s banks, which eagerly extended credit to the young Trump princeling. He bought the Plaza Hotel in 1988 for $407.5 million. He bought the Eastern Airlines shuttle fleet in 1989 for $365 million and called it Trump Shuttle. His newest casino, the Trump Taj Mahal, would need at least $1 million a day just to cover its debt.The skeptics who questioned the wisdom of this debt-fueled spending spree were drowned out by one magazine cover after another marveling at someone so young taking such breathtaking risks. But whatever Donald Trump was gambling, not for one second was he at risk of losing out on a lifetime of frictionless, effortless wealth. Fred Trump had that bet covered.Bailouts, collateral, cash on hand \u2014 Fred Trump was prepared, and was not about to let bad bets sink his son.As the 1980s ended, Donald Trump\u2019s big bets began to go bust. Trump Shuttle was failing to make loan payments within 15 months. The Plaza, drowning in debt, was bankrupt in four years. His Atlantic City casinos, also drowning in debt, tumbled one by one into bankruptcy.Fred Trump\u2019s generosity also provided a crucial backstop when his son pleaded with bankers in 1990 for an emergency line of credit. With so many of his projects losing money, Donald Trump had few viable assets of his own making to pledge as collateral. What has never been publicly known is that he used his stakes in the mini-empire and the high-rise for the elderly in East Orange as collateral to help secure a $65 million loan.Fred Trump, former employees say, detested taking unnecessary distributions from his companies because he would have to pay income taxes on them. So why would a penny-pinching, tax-hating 85-year-old in the twilight of his career abruptly pull so much money out of his cherished properties, incurring a tax bill of $12.2 million?The Times found no evidence that Fred Trump made any significant debt payments or charitable donations. The frugality he brought to business carried over to the rest of his life. According to ledgers of his personal spending, he spent a grand total of $8,562 in 1991 and 1992 on travel and entertainment. His extravagances, such as they were, consisted of buying his wife the odd gift from Antonovich Furs or hosting family celebrations at the Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn. His home on Midland Parkway in Jamaica Estates, Queens, built with unfussy brick like so many of his apartment buildings, had little to distinguish it from neighboring houses beyond the white columns and crest framing the front door.There are, however, indications that he wanted plenty of cash on hand to bail out his son if need be.Such was the case with the rescue mission at his son\u2019s Trump\u2019s Castle casino. Donald Trump had wildly overspent on renovations, leaving the property dangerously low on operating cash. Sure enough, neither Trump\u2019s Castle nor its owner had the necessary funds to make an $18.4 million bond payment due in December 1990.With this ruse \u2014 it was an illegal $3.5 million loan under New Jersey gaming laws, resulting in a $65,000 civil penalty \u2014 Donald Trump narrowly avoided defaulting on his bonds.Both the son and the father were masters of manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs.As the chip episode demonstrated, father and son were of one mind about rules and regulations, viewing them as annoyances to be finessed or, when necessary, ignored. As described by family members and associates in interviews and sworn testimony, theirs was an intimate, endless confederacy sealed by blood, shared secrets and a Hobbesian view of what it took to dominate and win. They talked almost daily and saw each other most weekends. Donald Trump sat at his father\u2019s right hand at family meals and participated in his father\u2019s monthly strategy sessions with his closest advisers. Fred Trump was a silent, watchful presence at many of Donald Trump\u2019s news conferences.\u201cI probably knew my father as well or better than anybody,\u201d Donald Trump said in a 2000 deposition.They were both fluent in the language of half-truths and lies, interviews and records show. They both delighted in transgressing without getting caught. They were both wizards at manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs.Those talents came in handy when Fred Trump Jr. died, on Sept. 26, 1981, at age 42 from complications of alcoholism, leaving a son and a daughter. The executors of his estate were his father and his brother Donald.Fred Trump Jr.\u2019s largest asset was his stake in seven of the eight buildings his father had transferred to his children. The Trumps would claim that those properties were worth $90.4 million when they finished converting them to cooperatives within a few years of his death. At that value, his stake could have generated an estate tax bill of nearly $10 million.This fantastical claim \u2014 that Park Briar should be taxed as if its value had fallen 83 percent in 18 days \u2014 slid past the I.R.S. with barely a protest. An auditor insisted the value should be increased by $100,000, to $3 million.During the 1980s, Donald Trump became notorious for leaking word that he was taking positions in stocks, hinting of a possible takeover, and then either selling on the run-up or trying to extract lucrative concessions from the target company to make him go away. It was a form of stock manipulation with an unsavory label: \u201cgreenmailing.\u201d The Times unearthed evidence that Mr. Trump enlisted his father as his greenmailing wingman.On Jan. 26, 1989, Fred Trump bought 8,600 shares of Time Inc. for $934,854, his tax returns show. Seven days later, Dan Dorfman, a financial columnist known to be chatty with Donald Trump, broke the news that the younger Trump had \u201ctaken a sizable stake\u201d in Time. Sure enough, Time\u2019s shares jumped, allowing Fred Trump to make a $41,614 profit in two weeks.Later that year, Fred Trump bought $5 million worth of American Airlines stock. Based on the share price \u2014 $81.74 \u2014 it appears he made the purchase shortly before Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump was taking a stake in the company. Within weeks, the stock was over $100 a share. Had Fred Trump sold then, he would have made a quick $1.3 million. But he didn\u2019t, and the stock sank amid skepticism about his son\u2019s history of hyped takeover attempts that fizzled. Fred Trump sold his shares for a $1.7 million loss in January 1990. A week later, Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump had sold, too.With other family members, Fred Trump could be cantankerous and cruel, according to sworn testimony by his relatives. \u201cThis is the stupidest thing I ever heard of,\u201d he\u2019d snap when someone disappointed him. He was different with his son Donald. He might chide him \u2014 \u201cFinish this job before you start that job,\u201d he\u2019d counsel \u2014 but more often, he looked for ways to forgive and accommodate.By 1987, for example, Donald Trump\u2019s loan debt to his father had grown to at least $11 million. Yet canceling the debt would have required Donald Trump to pay millions in taxes on the amount forgiven. Father and son found another solution, one never before disclosed, that appears to constitute both an unreported multimillion-dollar gift and a potentially illegal tax write-off.In December 1987, records show, Fred Trump bought a 7.5 percent stake in Trump Palace, a 55-story condominium building his son was erecting on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Most, if not all, of his investment, which totaled $15.5 million, was made by exchanging his son\u2019s unpaid debts for Trump Palace shares, records show.Under state law, developers must file \u201coffering plans\u201d that identify to any potential condo buyer the project\u2019s sponsors \u2014 in other words, its owners. The Trump Palace offering plan, submitted in November 1989, identified two owners: Donald Trump and his father. But under the same law, if Fred Trump had sold his stake to a third party, Donald Trump would have been required to identify the new owner in an amended offering plan filed with the state attorney general\u2019s office. He did not do that, records show.He did, however, sign a sworn affidavit a month after his father sold his stake. In the affidavit, submitted in a lawsuit over a Trump Palace contractor\u2019s unpaid bill, Donald Trump identified himself as \u201cthe\u201d owner of Trump Palace.Under I.R.S. rules, selling shares worth $15.5 million to your son for $10,000 is tantamount to giving him a $15.49 million taxable gift. Fred Trump reported no such gift.According to tax experts, the only circumstance that would not have required Fred Trump to report a gift was if Trump Palace had been effectively bankrupt when he unloaded his shares.Yet Trump Palace was far from bankrupt.Property records show that condo sales there were brisk in 1991. Trump Palace sold 57 condos for $52.5 million \u2014 94 percent of the total asking price for those units.By failing to tell the I.R.S. about his $15.49 million gift to his son, Fred Trump evaded the 55 percent tax on gifts, saving about $8 million. At the same time, he declared to the I.R.S. that Trump Palace was almost a complete loss \u2014 that he had walked away from a $15.5 million investment with just $10,000 to show for it.Federal tax law prohibits deducting any loss from the sale of property between members of the same family, because of the potential for abuse. Yet Fred Trump appears to have done exactly that, dodging roughly $5 million more in income taxes.The partnership between Fred and Donald Trump was not simply about the pursuit of riches. At its heart lay a more ambitious project, executed to perfection over decades \u2014 to create that origin story, the myth of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire.Donald Trump built the foundation for the myth in the 1970s by appropriating his father\u2019s empire as his own. By the late 1980s, instead of appropriating the empire, he was diminishing it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a great business, it was a good business,\u201d he said, as if Fred Trump ran a chain of laundromats. Yes, he told interviewers, his father was a wonderful mentor, but given the limits of his business, the most he could manage was a $1 million loan, and even that had to be repaid with interest.Donald Trump tried to change his ailing father\u2019s will, prompting a backlash \u2014 but also a recognition that plans had to be set in motion before Fred Trump died.Fred Trump had given careful thought to what would become of his empire after he died, and had hired one of the nation\u2019s top estate lawyers to draft his will. But in December 1990, Donald Trump sent his father a document, drafted by one of his own lawyers, that sought to make significant changes to that will.Fred Trump, then 85, had never before set eyes on the document, 12 pages of dense legalese. Nor had he authorized its preparation. Nor had he met the lawyer who drafted it.Yet his son sent instructions that he needed to sign it immediately.What happened next was described years later in sworn depositions by members of the Trump family during a dispute, later settled, over the inheritance Fred Trump left to Fred Jr.\u2019s children. These depositions, obtained by The Times, reveal something startling: Fred Trump believed that the document potentially put his life\u2019s work at risk.As close as they were \u2014 or perhaps because they were so close \u2014 Fred Trump did not immediately confront his son. Instead he turned to his daughter Maryanne Trump Barry, then a federal judge whom he often consulted on legal matters. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t pass the smell test,\u201d he told her, she recalled during her deposition. When Judge Barry read the codicil, she reached the same conclusion. \u201cDonald was in precarious financial straits by his own admission,\u201d she said, \u201cand Dad was very concerned as a man who worked hard for his money and never wanted any of it to leave the family.\u201d (In a brief telephone interview, Judge Barry declined to comment.)Fred Trump took prompt action to thwart his son. He dispatched his daughter to find new estate lawyers. One of them took notes on the instructions she passed on from her father: \u201cProtect assets from DJT, Donald\u2019s creditors.\u201d The lawyers quickly drafted a new codicil stripping Donald Trump of sole control over his father\u2019s estate. Fred Trump signed it immediately.Clumsy as it was, Donald Trump\u2019s failed attempt to change his father\u2019s will brought a family reckoning about two related issues: Fred Trump\u2019s declining health and his reluctance to relinquish ownership of his empire. Surgeons had removed a neck tumor a few years earlier, and he would soon endure hip replacement surgery and be found to have mild senile dementia. Yet for all the financial support he had lavished on his children, for all his abhorrence of taxes, Fred Trump had stubbornly resisted his advisers\u2019 recommendations to transfer ownership of his empire to the children to minimize estate taxes.With every passing year, the actuarial odds increased that Fred Trump would die owning apartment buildings worth many hundreds of millions of dollars, all of it exposed to the 55 percent estate tax. Just as exposed was the mountain of cash he was sitting on. His buildings, well maintained and carrying little debt, consistently produced millions of dollars a year in profits. Even after he paid himself $109.7 million from 1988 through 1993, his companies were holding $50 million in cash and investments, financial records show. Tens of millions of dollars more passed each month through a maze of personal accounts at Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, UBS, Bowery Savings and United Mizrahi, an Israeli bank.Simply put, without immediate action, Fred Trump\u2019s heirs faced the prospect of losing hundreds of millions of dollars to estate taxes.Whatever their differences, the Trumps formulated a plan to avoid this fate. How they did it is a story never before told.It is also a story in which Donald Trump played a central role. He took the lead in strategy sessions where the plan was devised with the consent and participation of his father and his father\u2019s closest advisers, people who attended the meetings told The Times. Robert Trump, the youngest sibling and the beta to Donald\u2019s alpha, was given the task of overseeing day-to-day details. After years of working for his brother, Robert Trump went to work for his father in late 1991.The Trumps\u2019 plan, executed over the next decade, blended traditional techniques \u2014 such as rewriting Fred Trump\u2019s will to maximize tax avoidance \u2014 with unorthodox strategies that tax experts told The Times were legally dubious and, in some cases, appeared to be fraudulent. As a result, the Trump children would gain ownership of virtually all of their father\u2019s buildings without having to pay a penny of their own. They would turn the mountain of cash into a molehill of cash. And hundreds of millions of dollars that otherwise would have gone to the United States Treasury would instead go to Fred Trump\u2019s children.A family company let Fred Trump funnel money to his children by effectively overcharging himself for repairs and improvements on his properties. All County had no corporate offices. Its address was the Manhasset, N.Y., home of John Walter, a favorite nephew of Fred Trump\u2019s. Mr. Walter, who died in January, spent decades working for Fred Trump, primarily helping computerize his payroll and billing systems. He also was the unofficial keeper of Fred Trump\u2019s personal and business papers, his basement crowded with boxes of old Trump financial records. John Walter and the four Trump children each owned 20 percent of All County, records show.All County\u2019s main purpose, The Times found, was to enable Fred Trump to make large cash gifts to his children and disguise them as legitimate business transactions, thus evading the 55 percent tax.The way it worked was remarkably simple.Each year Fred Trump spent millions of dollars maintaining and improving his properties. Some of the vendors who supplied his building superintendents and maintenance crews had been cashing Fred Trump\u2019s checks for decades. Starting in August 1992, though, a different name began to appear on their checks \u2014 All County Building Supply & Maintenance.Mr. Walter\u2019s computer systems, meanwhile, churned out All County invoices that billed Fred Trump\u2019s empire for those same services and supplies, with one difference: All County\u2019s invoices were padded, marked up by 20 percent, or 50 percent, or even more, records show.The Trump siblings split the markup, along with Mr. Walter.Years later, in his deposition during the dispute over Fred Trump\u2019s estate, Robert Trump would say that All County actually saved Fred Trump money by negotiating better deals. Given Fred Trump\u2019s long experience expertly squeezing better prices out of contractors, it was a surprising claim. It was also not true.The Times\u2019s examination of thousands of pages of financial documents from Fred Trump\u2019s buildings shows that his costs shot up once All County entered the picture.Beach Haven Apartments illustrates how this happened: In 1991 and 1992, Fred Trump bought 78 refrigerator-stove combinations for Beach Haven from Long Island Appliance Wholesalers. The average price was $642.69. But in 1993, when he began paying All County for refrigerator-stove combinations, the price jumped by 46 percent. Likewise, the price he paid for trash-compacting services at Beach Haven increased 64 percent. Janitorial supplies went up more than 100 percent. Plumbing repairs and supplies rose 122 percent. And on it went in building after building. The more Fred Trump paid, the more All County made, which was precisely the plan.While All County systematically overcharged Fred Trump for thousands of items, the job of negotiating with vendors fell, as it always had, to Fred Trump and his staff.Leon Eastmond can attest to this.Mr. Eastmond is the owner of A. L. Eastmond & Sons, a Bronx company that makes industrial boilers. In 1993, he and Fred Trump met at Gargiulo\u2019s, an old-school Italian restaurant in Coney Island that was one of Fred Trump\u2019s favorites, to hash out the price of 60 boilers. Fred Trump, accompanied by his secretary and Robert Trump, drove a hard bargain. After negotiating a 10 percent discount, he made one last demand: \u201cI had to pay the tab,\u201d Mr. Eastmond recalled with a chuckle.There was no mention of All County. Mr. Eastmond first heard of the company when its checks started rolling in. \u201cI remember opening my mail one day and out came a check for $100,000,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize the company. I didn\u2019t know who the hell they were.\u201dAll County\u2019s owners devised another ruse to profit off Mr. Eastmond\u2019s boilers. To win Fred Trump\u2019s business, Mr. Eastmond had also agreed to provide mobile boilers for Fred Trump\u2019s buildings free of charge while new boilers were being installed. Yet All County charged Fred Trump rent on the same mobile boilers Mr. Eastmond was providing free, along with hookup fees, disconnection fees, transportation fees and operating and maintenance fees, records show. These charges siphoned hundreds of thousands of dollars more from Fred Trump\u2019s empire.Mr. Walter, asked during a deposition why Fred Trump chose not to make himself one of All County\u2019s owners, replied, \u201cHe said because he would have to pay a death tax on it.\u201dAfter being briefed on All County by The Times, Mr. Tritt, the University of Florida law professor, said the Trumps\u2019 use of the company was \u201chighly suspicious\u201d and could constitute criminal tax fraud. \u201cIt certainly looks like a disguised gift,\u201d he said.While All County was all upside for Donald Trump and his siblings, it had an insidious downside for Fred Trump\u2019s tenants.As an owner of rent-stabilized buildings in New York, Fred Trump needed state approval to raise rents beyond the annual increases set by a government board. One way to justify a rent increase was to make a major capital improvement. It did not take much to get approval; an invoice or canceled check would do if the expense seemed reasonable.The Trumps used the padded All County invoices to justify higher rent increases in Fred Trump\u2019s rent-regulated buildings. Fred Trump, according to Mr. Walter, saw All County as a way to have his cake and eat it, too. If he used his \u201cexpert negotiating ability\u201d to buy a $350 refrigerator for $200, he could raise the rent based only on that $200, not on the $350 sticker price \u201ca normal person\u201d would pay, Mr. Walter explained. All County was the way around this problem. \u201cYou have to understand the thinking that went behind this,\u201d he said.As Robert Trump acknowledged in his deposition, \u201cThe higher the markup would be, the higher the rent that might be charged.\u201dState records show that after All County\u2019s creation, the Trumps got approval to raise rents on thousands of apartments by claiming more than $30 million in major capital improvements. Tenants repeatedly protested the increases, almost always to no avail, the records show.One of the improvements most often cited by the Trumps: new boilers.Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, disputed The Times\u2019s reporting: \u201cShould The Times state or imply that President Trump participated in fraud, tax evasion or any other crime, it will be exposing itself to substantial liability and damages for defamation.\u201dOn Jan. 21, 1994, they created a company called Apartment Management Associates Inc., with a mailing address at Mr. Walter\u2019s Manhasset home. Two months later, records show, Apartment Management started collecting fees that had previously gone to Trump Management.The only difference was that Donald Trump and his siblings owned Apartment Management.But these savings were trivial compared with those that would come when Fred Trump transferred his empire \u2014 the actual bricks and mortar \u2014 to his children.The transfer of most of Fred Trump\u2019s empire to his children began with a \u2018friendly\u2019 appraisal and an incredible shrinking act.Six months later, on Nov. 22, the Trumps began transferring ownership of most of Fred Trump\u2019s empire. (A few properties were excluded.) The instrument they used to do this was a special type of trust with a clunky acronym only a tax lawyer could love: GRAT, short for grantor-retained annuity trust.GRATs are one of the tax code\u2019s great gifts to the ultrawealthy. They let dynastic families like the Trumps pass wealth from one generation to the next \u2014 be it stocks, real estate, even art collections \u2014 without paying a dime of estate taxes.The details are numbingly complex, but the mechanics are straightforward. For the Trumps, it meant putting half the properties to be transferred into a GRAT in Fred Trump\u2019s name and the other half into a GRAT in his wife\u2019s name. Then Fred and Mary Trump gave their children roughly two-thirds of the assets in their GRATs. The children bought the remaining third by making annuity payments to their parents over the next two years. By Nov. 22, 1997, it was done; the Trump children owned nearly all of Fred Trump\u2019s empire free and clear of estate taxes.As for gift taxes, the Trumps found a way around those, too.The entire transaction turned on one number: the market value of Fred Trump\u2019s empire. This determined the amount of gift taxes Fred and Mary Trump owed for the portion of the empire they gave to their children. It also determined the amount of annuity payments their children owed for the rest.The I.R.S. recognizes that GRATs create powerful incentives to greatly undervalue assets, especially when those assets are not publicly traded stocks with transparent prices. Indeed, every $10 million reduction in the valuation of Fred Trump\u2019s empire would save the Trumps either $10 million in annuity payments or $5.5 million in gift taxes. This is why the I.R.S. requires families taking advantage of GRATs to submit independent appraisals and threatens penalties for those who lowball valuations.In practice, though, gift tax returns get little scrutiny from the I.R.S. It is an open secret among tax practitioners that evasion of gift taxes is rampant and rarely prosecuted. Punishment, such as it is, usually consists of an auditor\u2019s requiring a tax payment closer to what should have been paid in the first place. \u201cGRATs are typically structured so that no tax is due, which means the I.R.S. has reduced incentive to audit them,\u201d said Mitchell Gans, a professor of tax law at Hofstra University. \u201cSo if a gift is in fact undervalued, it may very well go unnoticed.\u201dThis appears to be precisely what the Trumps were counting on. The Times found evidence that the Trumps dodged hundreds of millions of dollars in gift taxes by submitting tax returns that grossly undervalued the real estate assets they placed in Fred and Mary Trump\u2019s GRATs.The methods the Trumps used to pull off this incredible shrinking act were hatched in the strategy sessions Donald Trump participated in during the early 1990s, documents and interviews show. Their basic strategy had two components: Get what is widely known as a \u201cfriendly\u201d appraisal of the empire\u2019s worth, then drive that number even lower by changing the ownership structure to make the empire look less valuable to the I.R.S.A crucial step was finding a property appraiser attuned to their needs. As anyone who has ever bought or sold a home knows, appraisers can arrive at sharply different valuations depending on their methods and assumptions. And like stock analysts, property appraisers have been known to massage those methods and assumptions in ways that coincide with their clients\u2019 interests.The Trumps used Robert Von Ancken, a favorite of New York City\u2019s big real estate families. Over a 45-year career, Mr. Von Ancken has appraised many of the city\u2019s landmarks, including Rockefeller Center, the World Trade Center, the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. Donald Trump recruited him after Fred Trump Jr. died and the family needed friendly appraisals to help shield the estate from taxes.Mr. Von Ancken appraised the 25 apartment complexes and other properties in the Trumps\u2019 GRATs and concluded that their total value was $93.9 million, tax records show.To assess the accuracy of those valuations, The Times examined the prices paid for comparable apartment buildings that sold within a year of Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s appraisals. A pattern quickly emerged. Again and again, buildings in the same neighborhood as Trump buildings sold for two to four times as much per square foot as Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s appraisals, even when the buildings were decades older, had fewer amenities and smaller apartments, and were deemed less valuable by city property tax appraisers.Mr. Von Ancken valued Argyle Hall, a six-story brick Trump building in Brooklyn, at $9.04 per square foot. Six blocks away, another six-story brick building, two decades older, had sold a few months earlier for nearly $30 per square foot. He valued Belcrest Hall, a Trump building in Queens, at $8.57 per square foot. A few blocks away, another six-story brick building, four decades older with apartments a third smaller, sold for $25.18 per square foot.The pattern persisted with Fred Trump\u2019s higher-end buildings. Mr. Von Ancken appraised Lawrence Towers, a Trump building in Brooklyn with spacious balcony apartments, at $24.54 per square foot. A few months earlier, an apartment building abutting car repair shops a mile away, with units 20 percent smaller, had sold for $48.23 per square foot.The Times found even starker discrepancies when comparing the GRAT appraisals against appraisals commissioned by the Trumps when they had an incentive to show the highest possible valuations.Such was the case with Patio Gardens, a complex of nearly 500 apartments in Brooklyn.Of all Fred Trump\u2019s properties, Patio Gardens was one of the least profitable, which may be why he decided to use it as a tax deduction. In 1992, he donated Patio Gardens to the National Kidney Foundation of New York/New Jersey, one of the largest charitable donations he ever made. The greater the value of Patio Gardens, the bigger his deduction. The appraisal cited in Fred Trump\u2019s 1992 tax return valued Patio Gardens at $34 million, or $61.90 a square foot.By contrast, Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s GRAT appraisals found that the crown jewels of Fred Trump\u2019s empire, Beach Haven and Shore Haven, with five times as many apartments as Patio Gardens, were together worth just $23 million, or $11.01 per square foot.In an interview, Mr. Von Ancken said that because neither he nor The Times had the working papers that described how he arrived at his valuations, there was simply no way to evaluate the methodologies behind his numbers. \u201cThere would be explanations within the appraisals to justify all the values,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cBasically, when we prepare these things, we feel that these are going to be presented to the Internal Revenue Service for their review, and they better be right.\u201dOf all the GRAT appraisals Mr. Von Ancken did for the Trumps, the most startling was for 886 rental apartments in two buildings at Trump Village, a complex in Coney Island. Mr. Von Ancken claimed that they were worth less than nothing \u2014 negative $5.9 million, to be exact. These were the same 886 units that city tax assessors valued that same year at $38.1 million, and that a bank would value at $106.6 million in 2004.It appears Mr. Von Ancken arrived at his negative valuation by departing from the methodology that he has repeatedly testified is most appropriate for properties like Trump Village, where past years\u2019 profits are a poor gauge of future value.In 1992, the Trumps had removed the two Trump Village buildings from an affordable housing program so they could raise rents and increase their profits. But doing so cost them a property tax exemption, which temporarily put the buildings in the red. The methodology described by Mr. Von Ancken would have disregarded this blip into the red and valued the buildings based on the higher rents the Trumps would be charging. Mr. Von Ancken, however, appears to have based his valuation on the blip, producing an appraisal that, taken at face value, meant Fred Trump would have had to pay someone millions of dollars to take the property off his hands.Mr. Von Ancken told The Times that he did not recall which appraisal method he used on the two Trump Village buildings. \u201cI can only say that we value the properties based on market information, and based on the expected income and expenses of the building and what they would sell for,\u201d he said. As for the enormous gaps between his valuation and the 1995 city property tax appraisal and the 2004 bank valuation, he argued that such comparisons were pointless. \u201cI can\u2019t say what happened afterwards,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they increased the income tremendously.\u201dTo further whittle the empire\u2019s valuation, the family created the appearance that Fred Trump held only 49.8 percent.Armed with Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s $93.9 million appraisal, the Trumps focused on slashing even this valuation by changing the ownership structure of Fred Trump\u2019s empire.The I.R.S. has long accepted the idea that ownership with control is more valuable than ownership without control. Someone with a controlling interest in a building can decide if and when the building is sold, how it is marketed and what price to accept. However, since someone who owns, say, 10 percent of a $100 million building lacks control over any of those decisions, the I.R.S. will let him claim that his stake should be taxed as if it were worth only $7 million or $8 million.But Fred Trump had exercised total control over his empire for more than seven decades. With rare exceptions, he owned 100 percent of his buildings. So the Trumps set out to create the fiction that Fred Trump was a minority owner. All it took was splitting the ownership structure of his empire. Fred and Mary Trump each ended up with 49.8 percent of the corporate entities that owned his buildings. The other 0.4 percent was split among their four children.Splitting ownership into minority interests is a widely used method of tax avoidance. There is one circumstance, however, where it has at times been found to be illegal. It involves what is known in tax law as the step transaction doctrine \u2014 where it can be shown that the corporate restructuring was part of a rapid sequence of seemingly separate maneuvers actually conceived and executed to dodge taxes. A key issue, according to tax experts, is timing \u2014 in the Trumps\u2019 case, whether they split up Fred Trump\u2019s empire just before they set up the GRATs.In all, the Trumps broke up 12 corporate entities to create the appearance of minority ownership. The Times could not determine when five of the 12 companies were divided. But records reveal that the other seven were split up just before the GRATs were established.The pattern was clear. For decades, the companies had been owned solely by Fred Trump, each operating a different apartment complex or shopping center. In September 1995, the Trumps formed seven new limited liability companies. Between Oct. 31 and Nov. 8, they transferred the deeds to the seven properties into their respective L.L.C.\u2019s. On Nov. 21, they recorded six of the deed transfers in public property records. (The seventh was recorded on Nov. 24.) And on Nov. 22, 49.8 percent of the shares in these seven L.L.C.\u2019s was transferred into Fred Trump\u2019s GRAT and 49.8 percent into Mary Trump\u2019s GRAT.That enabled the Trumps to slash Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s valuation in a way that was legally dubious. They claimed that Fred and Mary Trump\u2019s status as minority owners, plus the fact that a building couldn\u2019t be sold as easily as a share of stock, entitled them to lop 45 percent off Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s $93.9 million valuation. This claim, combined with $18.3 million more in standard deductions, completed the alchemy of turning real estate that would soon be valued at nearly $900 million into $41.4 million.According to tax experts, claiming a 45 percent discount was questionable even back then, and far higher than the 20 to 30 percent discount the I.R.S. would allow today.The I.R.S. determined that the Trumps\u2019 assets were worth $57.1 million, 38 percent more than the couple had claimed. From the perspective of an I.R.S. auditor, pulling in nearly $5 million in additional revenue could be considered a good day\u2019s work. For the Trumps, getting the I.R.S. to agree that Fred Trump\u2019s properties were worth only $57.1 million was a triumph.\u201cAll estate matters were handled by licensed attorneys, licensed C.P.A.s and licensed real estate appraisers who followed all laws and rules strictly,\u201d Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, said in his statement.In the end, the transfer of the Trump empire cost Fred and Mary Trump $20.5 million in gift taxes and their children $21 million in annuity payments. That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than they would have paid based on the empire\u2019s market value, The Times found.On the day the Trump children finally took ownership of Fred Trump\u2019s empire, Donald Trump\u2019s net worth instantly increased by many tens of millions of dollars. And from then on, the profits from his father\u2019s empire would flow directly to him and his siblings. The next year, 1998, Donald Trump\u2019s share amounted to today\u2019s equivalent of $9.6 million, The Times found.This sudden influx of wealth came only weeks after he had published \u201cThe Art of the Comeback.\u201d\u201cI learned a lot about myself during these hard times,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI learned about handling pressure. I was able to home in, buckle down, get back to the basics, and make things work. I worked much harder, I focused, and I got myself out of a box.\u201dOver 244 pages he did not mention that he was being handed nearly 25 percent of his father\u2019s empire.During Fred Trump\u2019s final years, dementia stole most of his memories. When family visited, there was one name he could reliably put to a face.Donald.On June 7, 1999, Fred Trump was admitted to Long Island Jewish Medical Center, not far from the house in Jamaica Estates, for treatment of pneumonia. He died there on June 25, at the age of 93.Fifteen months later, Fred Trump\u2019s executors \u2014 Donald, Maryanne and Robert \u2014 filed his estate tax return. The return, obtained by The Times, vividly illustrates the effectiveness of the tax strategies devised by the Trumps in the early 1990s.Fred Trump, one of the most prolific New York developers of his time, owned just five apartment complexes, two small strip malls and a scattering of co-ops in the city upon his death. The man who paid himself $50 million in 1990 died with just $1.9 million in the bank. He owned not a single stock, bond or Treasury bill. According to his estate tax return, his most valuable asset was a $10.3 million I.O.U. from Donald Trump, money his son appears to have borrowed the year before Fred Trump died.The bulk of Fred Trump\u2019s empire was nowhere to be found on his estate tax return. And yet Donald Trump and his siblings were not done. Recycling the legally dubious techniques they had mastered with the GRATs, they dodged tens of millions of dollars in estate taxes on the remnants of empire that Fred Trump still owned when he died, The Times found.As with the GRATs, they obtained appraisals from Mr. Von Ancken that grossly understated the actual market value of those remnants. And as with the GRATs, they aggressively discounted Mr. Von Ancken\u2019s appraisals. The result: They claimed that the five apartment complexes and two strip malls were worth $15 million. In 2004, records show, bankers would put a value of $176.2 million on the exact same properties.As with the Trump Village appraisal, the Trumps appear to have hidden key facts from the I.R.S. Tysens Park, like Trump Village, had operated for years under an affordable housing program that by law capped Fred Trump\u2019s profits. This cap drastically reduced the property\u2019s market value.Except for one thing: The Trumps had removed Tysens Park from the affordable housing program the year before Fred Trump died, The Times found. When Donald Trump and his siblings filed Fred Trump\u2019s estate tax return, there were no limits on their profits. In fact, they had already begun raising rents.As their father\u2019s executors, Donald, Maryanne and Robert were legally responsible for the accuracy of his estate tax return. They were obligated not only to give the I.R.S. a complete accounting of the value of his estate\u2019s assets, but also to disclose all the taxable gifts he made during his lifetime, including, for example, the $15.5 million Trump Palace gift to Donald Trump and the millions of dollars he gave his children via All County\u2019s padded invoices.\u201cIf they knew anything was wrong they could be in violation of tax law,\u201d Mr. Tritt, the University of Florida law professor, said. \u201cThey can\u2019t just stick their heads in the sand.\u201dIn addition to drastically understating the value of apartment complexes and shopping centers, Fred Trump\u2019s estate tax return made no mention of either Trump Palace or All County.It wasn\u2019t until after Fred Trump\u2019s wife, Mary, died at 88 on Aug. 7, 2000, that the I.R.S. completed its audit of their combined estates. The audit concluded that their estates were worth $51.8 million, 23 percent more than Donald Trump and his siblings had claimed.That meant an additional $5.2 million in estate taxes. Even so, the Trumps\u2019 tax bill was a fraction of what they would have owed had they reported the market value of what Fred and Mary Trump owned at the time of their deaths.Mr. Harder, the president\u2019s lawyer, defended the tax returns filed by the Trumps. \u201cThe returns and tax positions that The Times now attacks were examined in real time by the relevant taxing authorities,\u201d he said. \u201cThe taxing authorities requested a few minor adjustments, which were made, and then fully approved all of the tax filings. These matters have now been closed for more than a decade.\u201dIn 2003, the Trump siblings gathered at Trump Tower for one of their periodic updates on their inherited empire.As always, Robert Trump drove into Manhattan with several of his lieutenants. Donald Trump appeared with Allen H. Weisselberg, who had worked for Fred Trump for two decades before becoming his son\u2019s chief financial officer. The sisters, Maryanne Trump Barry and Elizabeth Trump Grau, were there as well.The meeting followed the usual routine: a financial report, a rundown of operational issues and then the real business \u2014 distributing profits to each Trump. The task of handing out the checks fell to Steve Gurien, the empire\u2019s finance chief.A moment later, Donald Trump abruptly changed the course of his family\u2019s history: He said it was a good time to sell.Fred Trump\u2019s empire, in fact, was continuing to produce healthy profits, and selling contradicted his stated wish to keep his legacy in the family. But Donald Trump insisted that the real estate market had peaked and that the time was right, according to a person familiar with the meeting.He was also, once again, in financial trouble. His Atlantic City casinos were veering toward another bankruptcy. His creditors would soon threaten to oust him unless he committed to invest $55 million of his own money.Yet if Donald Trump\u2019s sudden push to sell stunned the room, it met with no apparent resistance from his siblings. He directed his brother to solicit private bids, saying he wanted the sale handled quickly and quietly. Donald Trump\u2019s signature skill \u2014 drumming up publicity for the Trump brand \u2014 would sit this one out.Three potential bidders were given access to the finances of Fred Trump\u2019s empire \u2014 37 apartment complexes and several shopping centers. Ruby Schron, a major New York City landlord, quickly emerged as the favorite. In December 2003, Mr. Schron called Donald Trump and they came to an agreement; Mr. Schron paid $705.6 million for most of the empire, which included paying off the Trumps\u2019 mortgages. A few remaining properties were sold to other buyers, bringing the total sales price to $737.9 million.On May 4, 2004, the Trump children spent most of the day signing away ownership of what their father had doggedly built over 70 years. The sale received little news coverage, and an article in The Staten Island Advance included the rarest of phrases: \u201cTrump did not return a phone call seeking comment.\u201dEven more extraordinary was this unreported fact: The banks financing Mr. Schron\u2019s purchase valued Fred Trump\u2019s empire at nearly $1 billion. In other words, Donald Trump, master dealmaker, sold his father\u2019s empire for hundreds of millions less than it was worth.Within a year of the sale, Mr. Trump spent $149 million in cash on a rapid series of transactions that bolstered his billionaire bona fides. In June 2004 he agreed to pay $73 million to buy out his partner in the planned Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago. (\u201cI\u2019m just buying it with my own cash,\u201d he told reporters.) He paid $55 million in cash to make peace with his casino creditors. Then he put up $21 million more in cash to help finance his purchase of Maison de l\u2019Amiti\u00e9, a waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., that he later sold to a Russian oligarch.*****The first season of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was broadcast in 2004, just as Donald Trump was wrapping up the sale of his father\u2019s empire. The show\u2019s opening montage \u2014 quick cuts of a glittering Trump casino, then Trump Tower, then a Trump helicopter mid-flight, then a limousine depositing the man himself at the steps of his jet, all set to the song \u201cFor the Love of Money\u201d \u2014 is a reminder that the story of Donald Trump is fundamentally a story of money.Money is at the core of the brand Mr. Trump has so successfully sold to the world. Yet essential to that mythmaking has been keeping the truth of his money \u2014 how much of it he actually has, where and whom it came from \u2014 hidden or obscured. Across the decades, aided and abetted by less-than-aggressive journalism, Mr. Trump has made sure his financial history would be sensationalized far more than seen.In a statement to The Times, the president\u2019s spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, reiterated what Mr. Trump has always claimed about the evolution of his fortune: \u201cThe president\u2019s father gave him an initial $1 million loan, which he paid back. President Trump used this money to build an incredibly successful company as well as net worth of over $10 billion, including owning some of the world\u2019s greatest real estate.\u201dBut the more than 100,000 pages of records obtained during this investigation make it possible to sweep away decades of misinformation and arrive at a clear understanding about the original source of Mr. Trump\u2019s wealth \u2014 his father.Here is what can be said with certainty: Had Mr. Trump done nothing but invest the money his father gave him in an index fund that tracks the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, he would be worth $1.96 billion today. As for that $1 million loan, Fred Trump actually lent him at least $60.7 million, or $140 million in today\u2019s dollars, The Times found.And there is one more Fred Trump windfall coming Donald Trump\u2019s way. Starrett City, the Brooklyn housing complex that the Trumps invested in back in the 1970s, sold this year for $905 million. Donald Trump\u2019s share of the proceeds is expected to exceed $16 million, records show.It was an investment made with Fred Trump\u2019s money and connections. But in Donald Trump\u2019s version of his life, Starrett City is always and forever \u201cone of the best investments I ever made.\u201dPhoto illustration by Grant Gold/The New York Times.

That fact alone makes it worth tuning in, according to Vivian Wang, who covers New York politics for The New York Times. Mr. Cuomo has held group debates in the past, but not a one-on-one in the general election in eight years.So what will the two be debating?What else will we see or hear?\u201cThat comment is an example of when the governor tried to attack Trump and cast himself as an avatar of the left,\u201d Ms. Wang said. \u201cAnd sometimes it hasn\u2019t always played as well as he would hope.

{"Headline": "Florida Governor Candidates Andrew Gillum and Ron DeSantis Face Off in Contentious Debate", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMIAMI \u2014 Ron DeSantis and Andrew Gillum delivered fiery exchanges in their first debate on Sunday night, showing a national audience why they are locked in a fierce, closely matched race to become Florida\u2019s next governor. They differed not only on their strikingly opposite policy positions, but also on matters of personal integrity and character that have shaped the election.From the start, Mr. DeSantis went on the offensive, characterizing Mr. Gillum as a \u201cfailed mayor.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s presided over a crime-ridden city,\u201d Mr. DeSantis said. \u201cHe\u2019s involved in corruption. He\u2019s not the guy to lead our state.\u201dMr. Gillum chuckled \u2014 \u201cWell, that was a mouthful,\u201d he said \u2014 and launched into a direct appeal to Florida voters, a theme he returned to throughout the hourlong CNN debate, held in Tampa, Fla.\u201cI\u2019m here this evening standing for anybody that\u2019s ever been told that they don\u2019t belong,\u201d Mr. Gillum said. \u201cThat they didn\u2019t come from the right background or the right pedigree. I\u2019m here fighting for everyday Floridians so that this is a state that works for all again.\u201dThe debate came at a crucial moment in the campaign: 16 days from the Nov. 6 election, and the night before early voting sites open in some of the state\u2019s biggest counties. Most polls suggest the race is effectively tied, as is typical in Florida, the nation\u2019s largest presidential swing state.As has seemed inevitable this midterm year, much of the discussion centered on the president.\u201cDonald Trump is weak, and he performs as all weak people do: They become bullies,\u201d Mr. Gillum said. \u201cAnd Mr. DeSantis is his acolyte.\u201dMr. Trump will be more agreeable to offering the full weight of the federal government\u2019s resources to a state with a friendly governor, Mr. DeSantis insisted, an assertion sharply rejected by Mr. Gillum, who said that any sort of loyalty test was undemocratic.\u201cThis is not Russia,\u201d Mr. Gillum said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to kiss the ring of the president of the United States for the president to see to the good of the third-largest state.\u201dMr. Gillum managed to keep attention on health care, an issue Democrats see as crucial this year, and highlighted that Mr. DeSantis has not released a health care policy plan during the campaign.Mr. DeSantis pounced on Mr. Gillum for wanting to abolish the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, and Mr. Gillum said he would favor placing the agency under the oversight of the Department of Justice, rather than the Department of Homeland Security.\u201cWe all have friends that sometimes let us down,\u201d Mr. Gillum said. Then, he made the sort of declaration that politicians dread making on national television: \u201cLet me be very clear about what the record is: I am not under F.B.I. investigation.\u201dMr. Gillum suggested that the fact he is African-American had something to do with Mr. DeSantis\u2019s attacks, including his questions about a pair of 2016 trips to a luxury villa in Costa Rica and a Broadway production in New York, revealed to the public in documents subpoenaed by the F.B.I. The trips are now under state ethics investigation.\u201cThe question is, did you pay for the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 ticket, or did the undercover F.B.I. agent pay for the \u2018Hamilton\u2019 ticket?\u201d Mr. DeSantis asked. \u201cDid you pay to stay in the villa in Costa Rica?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t take free trips from anybody,\u201d retorted Mr. Gillum, who later accused Mr. DeSantis of \u201cshowboating.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m a hardworking person. I know that may not fit your description of what you think people like me do. But I\u2019ve worked hard for everything that I\u2019ve gotten in my life, and I don\u2019t need anybody handing me anything for free.\u201dBoth candidates made several references to the environment, though neither delved into much detail about their proposals. This being Florida, which faces a threat from rising seas, the first debate question was about climate change. Mr. DeSantis said he supports \u201cresiliency\u201d efforts but does not want to be a climate \u201calarmist\u201d; Mr. Gillum said he will be a governor \u201cwho believes in science.\u201dPerhaps the most surprising moment came at the start of the debate, when Mr. Tapper noted that Mr. Gillum and Mr. DeSantis had just met for the first time \u2014 a sign of how the nation\u2019s polarized politics have given elected leaders infrequent opportunities to overlap.\u201cGood to meet you, Andrew,\u201d Mr. DeSantis said in his closing statement. \u201cIt\u2019s been a fun night.\u201d\u201cI wish you well,\u201d Mr. Gillum said, as the rivals shook hands.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times.

{"Headline": "My Year as a Trump Ambassador", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome disorder is normal at the start of an administration. But it was extreme under Mr. Trump. Ms. Jacobson was the United States ambassador to Mexico until May. The back story of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign to dismantle Nafta is not just about his obsession with one agreement. It is also a window into a chaotic decision-making style that has undermined America\u2019s diplomacy and national interests across the globe. I observed this disarray up close for more than a year as the ambassador to Mexico. It wasn\u2019t pretty.The first time White House officials told reporters that the president intended to rip up Nafta, in the spring of 2017, I was about to attend the Mexican air show, one of the most important commercial events involving Mexico and the United States.Billions of dollars in trade between the two countries are at stake during the show, where a host of American aerospace suppliers demonstrate their wares. As the ambassador to Mexico, I would have expected to have been told what the president intended to do about the most vital part of our relationship with Mexico.But this is not how things work in the Trump era.I learned about the draft one-page notification of our plan to exit Nafta from countless emails and phone calls from reporters and Mexican officials. Now I was going to spend a hot April afternoon with the Mexican president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, without warning or instructions from Washington. What was I supposed to tell him?I had been a diplomat for over 30 years, serving under five presidents, with stints in Argentina and Peru, and as assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs. I had visited nearly every country in the Americas, mastered the bureaucratic skills needed to get things done and served on crisis task forces for hurricanes, earthquakes and coups. I had always relied on guidance from my State Department superiors, and the White House via the National Security Council. Such guidance was rare after Mr. Trump assumed office.Despite Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric vilifying Mexicans and focusing on a border wall, embassy officials and our Mexican partners felt after his inauguration that we would be able to continue working well together. But it quickly became impossible to know how to influence the mess in Washington.On that April afternoon in 2017, I knew that Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state, didn\u2019t want to get involved in Nafta talks and rarely took calls from even a senior ambassador. So I talked to senior career colleagues from the Office of the United States Trade Representative and the Commerce Department, but they knew little more than I did.As President Pe\u00f1a Nieto joined diplomats and government and military officials on the reviewing stand, he paused to greet me and emphasized that it was imperative that we talk later. When we finally sat down alone, the president, unfailingly polite, was blunt: What the hell was going on? \u201cYour president is going to pull out of Nafta before we\u2019ve even had a chance to sit down and work on this?\u201d he said to me. \u201cThis would be a disaster \u2014 economically, politically.\u201dAll I could tell him was that I was continuing to speak with the White House and hoped cooler heads would prevail. I noted that this was coming just after a spate of negative articles about the first 100 days of the Trump administration. I was learning that critical news reports almost inevitably led the president to fall back on his standard refrains: Build the wall, or Nafta is the worst deal ever.The draft document to pull out of Nafta was never sent. Why? We\u2019re not really sure. Perhaps because the Mexican foreign minister, Luis Videgaray, engineered a phone call between Presidents Trump and Pe\u00f1a Nieto. Perhaps Mr. Trump\u2019s secretary of agriculture showed him evidence that his rural, agricultural base would be hurt. Or because powerful Republicans in Congress weighed in against ruining an important trading relationship. I can only hope that the president and his team are beginning to recognize that we need our allies, most importantly Canada and Mexico, if we are to tackle some of our most difficult domestic problems. But I am not confident of that.I left Mexico on May 5 \u2014 Cinco de Mayo \u2014 exactly two years after I had been sworn in as ambassador, and retired from government service at the end of May. Believing deeply in the United States-Mexico relationship, I cannot pretend anything less than relief at no longer having to defend the indefensible. But I also feel glad to escape the disorder I witnessed for more than a year.Over the past three decades, successive American administrations have worked diligently to vanquish the anti-American DNA in Mexico. We were overcoming the suspicions that a history of invasion, territorial loss and imperial intent had bequeathed. That kind of trust is slow to build, and remarkably easy to destroy.

{"Headline": "Trump Takes Center Stage in Dispute Over Jamal Khashoggi", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISTANBUL \u2014 Turkey and Saudi Arabia are increasingly focused on Washington as the decisive factor in their escalating standoff over the disappearance of a Saudi dissident, according to people representing both sides of the dispute.Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post, entered the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul 10 days ago. But the two countries maintain starkly divergent accounts of what happened next.Turkish officials, who have presented security camera footage of Mr. Khashoggi walking into the consulate, accuse the Saudis of killing him inside and dismembering his body with a bone saw.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and other Saudi officials have insisted repeatedly that Mr. Khashoggi left the consulate freely, without showing any video footage of him exiting the building to corroborate their version of events.Now Turkish officials say they are counting on Washington to force Saudi Arabia to provide a more detailed accounting of what actually happened to Mr. Khashoggi.Turkish officials say they have video and audio evidence demonstrating that he was killed. But without pressure from the United States, a vital ally of Saudi Arabia, Turkish officials are concerned that they will not have enough leverage to get the Saudis to acknowledge what took place inside the consulate.\u201cAt the end of the day, the U.S. has to take action,\u201d said one senior Turkish official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss internal deliberations. \u201cThe ball is in Trump\u2019s court.\u201dPresident Trump said Friday that he planned to speak with King Salman, the prince\u2019s father, about the disappearance, but that he had not done so yet.\u201cI will be calling, I will be calling at some point King Salman,\u201d Mr. Trump told reporters traveling with him in Ohio. \u201cA lot of people are looking to find out because it is potentially a really, really terrible situation.\u201dBut Mr. Trump also deflected questions about the kingdom\u2019s human rights record. Asked if it had been overlooked for too long, the president directed attention to other countries.\u201cI think a lot of records are overlooked,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at Iran, if you look at some of the other countries, if you take a look at Syria, if you take a look at a lot of countries, a lot of countries\u2019 records have been overlooked. But this is a very serious thing and we\u2019re looking at it in a very serious manner.\u201dTurkish officials have dribbled out a series of lurid leaks describing an assassination scheme so complex that it could have been directed only from a senior level of the Saudi royal court: a team of 15 agents, including a top Saudi doctor of forensics, flying into Turkey on two private planes the day of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s appointment at the consulate expressly to kill him and dispose of the mess.In statements, however, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has stopped short of directly accusing the Saudis. Turkish officials have said their president has held his fire in part because he hopes that Washington will help push Saudi Arabia to acknowledge what happened to Mr. Khashoggi.But such faith in Washington is hard for almost any Turkish politician to espouse publicly these days because of a tide of anti-Americanism that has swept the country since Mr. Trump raised tariffs on several categories of Turkish imports, punishing the country\u2019s struggling economy.\u201cIntervention by Trump is the highest form of mockery,\u201d Resul Tosun, a columnist for the pro-government Star newspaper wrote on Friday, arguing that any American help with the investigation would \u201cportray Turkey as a banana republic.\u201dBut even some critics of Mr. Erdogan say his government\u2019s leak strategy may swing Washington its way.\u201cThe public attention is enough now, the story cannot be buried anymore,\u201d said Asli Aydintasbas, a Turkish commentator critical of the president, recounting the extensive coverage in American newspapers and the statements of American politicians criticizing Saudi Arabia.\u201cThe Saudis are being held responsible,\u201d she added.A Saudi delegation arrived in Turkey on Friday morning to address the case, a day after the two countries had announced plans for a joint \u201cworking group\u201d to investigate Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.But instead of heading for the site of the disappearance in Istanbul, the delegation landed first in Turkey\u2019s capital, Ankara, suggesting that diplomatic negotiations may have been a higher priority than police work.Some of Saudi Arabia\u2019s allies in Washington acknowledge that pressure from the United States could force the kingdom to offer some account of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fate \u2014 even if it is a modified version that shields the kingdom\u2019s day-to-day ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed, from any responsibility.One analyst sympathetic to the rulers of the kingdom, speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid alienating the court, said that even United States senators \u201cfriendly to Saudi Arabia\u201d had begun expressing alarm.\u201cClearly something went horribly wrong, and Saudi Arabia has to come out and make a credible explanation,\u201d the analyst said. \u201cI expect some clarification from Riyadh very soon.\u201dSenator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said mounting signs that Saudi Arabia may have killed Mr. Khashoggi threatened to \u201cdestroy any relationship I have with that part of Saudi Arabia.\u201d\u201cWith every passing day it is less likely that he is alive and more likely that the Saudi Arabian government had a hand in his death, and if that is the case that will be an act of contempt by them for the United States,\u201d Mr. Graham said.\u201cIf the crown prince had something to do with this, I don\u2019t see how he could be a legitimate leader on the international stage again.\u201dUnlike with other foreign policy issues, Mr. Trump faces a bipartisan chorus calling for a tougher approach to Saudi Arabia. Representatives Edward R. Royce, Republican of California and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York, the ranking minority member, sent a letter to Mr. Trump on Friday urging him to cancel Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s planned trip to Saudi Arabia next week to participate in a business conference there.\u201cParticipation in this conference is not critical to our economic security and would potentially undermine efforts to show the Saudi government and others around the world that brazen attacks on civilians inside consular facilities are unacceptable,\u201d they wrote.They also urged Mr. Trump to review Saudi citizens serving in diplomatic posts in the United States. \u201cThere should be no chance that what apparently happened in Ankara could happen here,\u201d they wrote.So far, Mr. Trump has not canceled Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s trip, although he hinted on Friday that the stop might be scrubbed. A number of American businesses, including The New York Times, have decided not to participate in the conference as a result of the Khashoggi case.\u201cA lot of people are going over to the investment conference,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens. Maybe some won\u2019t be going. We\u2019ll make that determination very soon.\u201dThis week, Mr. Trump explained that he did not want to jeopardize lucrative American defense contracts with Saudi Arabia over the case. He disclaimed responsibility by noting that the disappearance took place abroad and that Mr. Khashoggi was \u201cnot a United States citizen.\u201dThen on Friday, the president tweeted that he had been \u201cworking very hard\u201d to win the release of an American pastor, Andrew Brunson, who had been detained in Turkey for 24 months before being freed on Friday.\u201cAnd what about @Khashoggi #Jamal Khashoggi?!,\u201d the dissident\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, shot back on Friday in a tweet to Mr. Trump.Carlotta Gall contributed reporting from Sakran, Turkey.

Hagerty, the United States ambassador to Japan, said Japanese officials had not fully grasped political realities in the United States when they pressed for regional talks.\u201cThe way it was being portrayed was that it was some sort of unilateral action on behalf of President Trump that took place the first week of him being in office,\u201d said Mr. Hagerty. \u201cI think they thought that we could come back to it.\u201d\u201cMy job has been to convey that political reality,\u201d Mr. Hagerty added, \u201cand to encourage our counterparts in Japan to look forward in terms of our relationship, rather than to continue to look back and asking us to do something that is just a political dead end in the United States.\u201d\u201cThe threat of auto tariffs was very huge,\u201d said Junya Inose, a senior economist at the Mitsubishi Research Institute in Tokyo.He said Japan has also closely watched the escalating trade war with China. \u201cWe have learned that if we do not talk seriously, maybe the same thing with China may happen even to the Japanese economy,\u201d Mr. Inose said. \u201cMost of the Japanese ministers consider some kind of pain must be paid to calm down Trump.\u201d\u201cI think that was a significant and necessary concession to Japan,\u201d said Wendy Cutler, a former United States trade negotiator who is now managing director of the Washington office of the Asia Society Policy Institute.With farmers in the United States already suffering from the trade war with China, \u201cthey are going to be very anxious to get quick and equal access to the Japanese agricultural market,\u201d said Ms. Cutler.Japanese officials insist that the United States will accept the agricultural limits.\u201cThe agreement of the U.S. and Japan states that with regard to agriculture, Japan\u2019s previous economic partnership agreements constitute the maximum level, and the United States will respect the position of Japan,\u201d said Yoshihide Suga, chief cabinet secretary to Mr. Abe, in remarks to reporters. \u201cSo I believe that this is our shared understanding.\u201dMr. Hagerty said Mr. Trump had acknowledged Japan\u2019s position in discussions with Mr. Abe in New York last month. \u201cIt was important that we said we respect it,\u201d the ambassador said. \u201cI\u2018m not going to get in front of the negotiators because I don\u2019t know the specifics.\u201dWith those deals, \u201cTrump already has two so-to-speak report cards to wave in front of the crowd,\u201d said June Park, adjunct professor of international political economy at Hanyang University in Seoul, South Korea. \u201cSo cosmetic deals are not what\u2019s really necessary for Trump right now. On Japan he wants something big.\u201dMr. Trump has repeatedly exhorted Japan to move more auto production to the United States \u2014 something it started doing decades ago. Japanese automakers already build about four million cars a year there.Mr. Hagerty suggested the Japanese could add even more factories. \u201cIt\u2019s just better business. It\u2019s Economics 101,\u201d he said. \u201cIt de-risks their business model and gets them closer to their market. And the U.S. benefits from the capital investment and the jobs.\u201dBilateral talks are expected to start in January, and how deep they go may depend on how quickly the Trump administration wants to score a victory.A deal \u201ccould go broadly or it could be relatively narrow,\u201d said Clara Gillispie, senior director for trade, economic and energy affairs at the National Bureau of Asian Research in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s also a question of how fast versus how slow you want to go in the process.\u201dKantaro Suzuki contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.There he goes again.With Republicans struggling to keep their grip on Congress, President Trump is dialing up the demagogy. At campaign rallies and on social media, he\u2019s spewing dark warnings about a Democratic mob clamoring to usher in an era of open borders, rampant crime, social chaos and economic radicalism.Such a shift has been in discussion among administration officials for more than a year, and the memo in question has been floating around since the spring. Health and Human Services is expected to present its official case to the Department of Justice by year\u2019s end. Yet, like Mr. Trump\u2019s prior reversals of Obama-era policies that expanded transgender rights, the news understandably sent a ripple of fear and anguish through the community of 1.4 million transgender Americans, their loved ones and anyone who cares about civil rights. Mr. Trump plays the polarization game because he enjoys it \u2014 he does love a brawl \u2014 and because he doesn\u2019t appear to care about much beyond his political and personal fortunes. And, more practically speaking, these days he doesn\u2019t have much else to talk about.It\u2019s not that this president has failed to achieve anything in his first couple of years in office. The economy is chugging along right now, and many Republican candidates would be happy for him to play that up on the campaign trail. Thus, as Mr. Trump moves to make the case for Republicans in the midterms, he has few options beyond revving up his base. Which might be motivating \u2014 possibly even energizing \u2014 for some die-hard partisans on both sides of the battle. But it is more than a little dispiriting for the millions of Americans already exhausted by seemingly endless outrage. And it is really bad for the country.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": " The End of the Australian Miracle?", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe country needs to find ways to share prosperity with workers.CANBERRA, Australia \u2014 Ten years ago, when the world economy suffered its most severe slump since the Great Depression, Australia was the only advanced country to avoid a recession. While double-digit unemployment ravaged many nations, Australia\u2019s jobless rate stayed below 6 percent. The hit to our housing was minimal, and the impact on the Australian stock market was temporary. It took until 2013 for the United States to return to pre-Great Recession living standards, but Australia bounced back by 2010.But now Australia needs to focus its innovative policy approach on the economy and find ways to share prosperity with workers.In principle, stagnant wages for average workers could reflect poor productivity. But that isn\u2019t true here, with productivity growing at a healthy rate. A bigger problem for employees is that they have less bargaining power.There are many policy options to tilt the scales back toward employees. Ending the popular practice of hiring \u201cpermanent casual\u201d employees would provide greater certainty to workers who want to start a family or buy a home. Reversing the cut in Sunday pay rates would raise earnings for hundreds of thousands of low-paid restaurant and retail workers.Australia also faces a challenge from the rise of China, which is Australia\u2019s leading source of tourists, foreign students and imports, and its top export market. Few nations are as enmeshed with China\u2019s economy as Australia. Trade wars hurt everyone, but they pose a special risk for countries that are smaller and less diversified: Australia\u2019s economy would suffer badly from an escalation of conflict between America, our strongest security partner, and China, our most important economic partner.Ideally, the next round of Australian prosperity would come from reforms that spur both growth and equity.From beer to banking, many Australian markets are dominated by a few big firms. Slowing the pace of mergers and accelerating the pace of start-ups would be good for growth.Across advanced nations, health care systems are amazingly successful at saving people in emergency rooms, but not so good at addressing chronic problems such as obesity and inactivity. Something similar could be said about the Australian economy. Having dodged the worst of the downturn a decade ago, Australia must now grapple with the problems of equity and economic diversity. In a world of uncertainty and technological disruption, the country\u2019s prosperity now depends more on smart long-term reforms than savvy crisis management.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Italy Is in Trouble With the E.U. Here\u2019s Why the World Should Care.", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySinking confidence in Rome\u2019s solvency could cause financial chain reactions that would be difficult for governments and central banks to control.Bond traders and European politicians should be worried about such things. But do they really matter to ordinary Italians and the rest of the world?Unfortunately, yes. There can be dire consequences when interest rates spike and investors lose confidence in a country\u2019s ability to pay its debts.In light of the tension between Italy\u2019s populist government and the European Commission, there is a good chance that Standard & Poor\u2019s will follow Moody\u2019s lead on Friday, putting pressure on the other two main ratings agencies \u2014 Fitch and DBRS \u2014 to do the same.Italy probably has several months to avoid slipping over the cliff to the junk abyss. It might show a willingness to compromise with Brussels, or perhaps the government\u2019s spending plans will defy predictions and, as promised, revive the economy. But if Italy did suffer another downgrade, chain reactions that would be difficult for governments and central banks to control could ensue.Here is a look at what might happen in the worst case.Italy\u2019s big lenders have taken a beating over the last 10 years and are already in a weakened state. All of them have big stockpiles of Italian government bonds. If that debt loses value, as it would after downgrades, the banks will suffer losses, eroding their capital.The banks might then lose the trust of financial markets as investors worry about their solvency. All banks depend on a constant flow of borrowed money that they lend to customers or use to roll over debts. If that cash spigot runs dry \u2014 a so-called liquidity crisis \u2014 banks can quickly get into trouble. That happened en masse to banks in Europe and the United States during the 2008 financial crisis.Italian banks have thicker capital cushions than they did during that financial crisis, a report by Deutsche Bank said Tuesday, but \u201cliquidity still represents a risk.\u201dWhen banks in the eurozone are shunned by the market, they can turn to the European Central Bank. But that raises another issue.Eurozone banks can borrow as much as they want from the central bank at zero interest, but there is a catch. They have to put up collateral. One of the most common forms of collateral is, wouldn\u2019t you know it, government bonds.If those bonds are rated junk by all four ratings agencies, the European Central Bank no longer accepts them. This happened to banks in Greece when Greek government bonds fell to junk status, contributing to severe economic hardship.The banks can stake other collateral, such as bonds from more solvent countries or corporate debt. But experience shows that troubled banks are usually short of other assets. They can still borrow money from the central bank, but at significantly higher interest rates, putting them at a competitive disadvantage.The European Central Bank has a separate program that would allow it to buy Italian bonds on the open market, helping to hold down the country\u2019s borrowing costs. But Italy would be eligible only if it agreed to conditions that would certainly include spending limits, something the populist government is unlikely to accept.Bank woes become problems in everyday life because businesses and consumers can no longer get credit. They spend less, and growth slumps. In Italy\u2019s case, the overstretched government would not be able to pay for bank rescues. (One of the reasons Italy is in so much debt in the first place is that it has already spent huge sums rescuing its banks.)When people spend and earn less, they pay less in taxes. Government revenue drops, Rome\u2019s ability to make debt payments suffers, and a vicious cycle begins that is difficult to stop at the nation\u2019s borders.Among economists there is a debate about whether Italy could provoke another major financial crisis. Some experts argue that the financial system has become stronger since 2010, when Greece\u2019s debt problems nearly destroyed the eurozone.But there are many ways that local meltdowns can go global. Banks or investment funds outside Italy may own Italian government bonds and suffer losses. Investors start to fear that other time bombs may be ticking. They flee any stock or bond that seems risky, causing markets to slump. Stock markets across the world, which have been jumpy in recent weeks, slid lower on Tuesday.The biggest risk may be something that most people have not considered yet. Bankers are always inventing new ways to make money, spawning new financial hazards. The members of the Financial Stability Board also warned Monday of the dangers of so-called shadow banking: financial transactions by hedge funds, private equity firms that have acquired huge financial power but are lightly regulated if at all.\u201cNew forms of interconnectedness have emerged,\u201d the board said, \u201cthat could, in some scenarios, act as channels for domestic and cross-border amplification of risks.\u201dThat\u2019s a polite way of saying \u201cmarket panic.\u201d The world is not there yet, but the conflict between Brussels and Rome has raised the chances.Advertisement"}

Nutritional services \u2014 cooking and serving food \u2014 were valued at \u00a3158 billion, with laundry set at \u00a389 billion.The overall total is greater than the combined output of Britain\u2019s retail and manufacturing companies, and amounts to an average of nearly \u00a319,000 of unpaid work by each person in Britain, whether otherwise employed or not.\u201cWomen are at a clear disadvantage by the unfair burden of the amount of household work they are expected to do,\u201d said Alexandra Holt, a volunteer researcher for the Fawcett Society, a women\u2019s rights charity.\u201cWhile it\u2019s useful to have these figures available to us, nothing will change before we fix the ingrained perception in society that equates femininity with domesticity,\u201d Ms. Holt added.The aim of the study, which covers 2016 and is based on information gleaned from a range of national surveys, statistics and census information, is to supplement the gross domestic product to fully capture the true size and shape of the British economy and the population\u2019s living standards, the agency said.\u201cOur headline measures of the economy focus on paid-for activity, such as when someone employs a childminder or uses a travel agent,\u201d Richard Tonkin, the statistics office\u2019s head of income and wealth, said in an email.\u201cTo give a complete picture of the U.K. economy and society, we publish these additional numbers to estimate the value of activity where there is no payment involved,\u201d he added.The statistics also show that 2.2 million vulnerable adults were being cared for without charge in 2016, equating to the work of more than four million adult social workers working every week of the year.Vulnerable adults in Britain are becoming increasingly dependent on their families and volunteers for care, with adult social services in many parts of the country under huge pressure from budget cuts and the rising costs of meeting complex needs.\u201cThe overall value of unpaid adult care is increasingly being driven by those requiring around-the-clock, full-time care, with continuous care hours accounting for 86.9 percent of total adult care hours in 2005 and 89.7 percent of adult care hours in 2016,\u201d the statistics office said in a statement.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Former South Korean President Gets 15 Years in Prison for Corruption", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a nationally televised ruling on Friday, Mr. Lee was convicted of collecting bribes from various sources, including 6.1 billion won, or about $5.4 million, from Samsung, the country\u2019s largest business conglomerate, when he was a presidential candidate and after he took office in 2008.The presidential pardon of Lee Kun-hee was criticized at the time as an example of leniency for top businessmen found guilty of serious white-collar crimes. The tycoon had been forced to resign as Samsung chairman in 2008 after allegations of corruption surfaced against him, but he returned to the company\u2019s leadership ranks just months after being pardoned.Lee Myung-bak said at the time that he decided to grant Lee Kun-hee special amnesty so the businessman could retain his membership on the International Olympic Committee and lead South Korea\u2019s bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics.The court on Friday also ruled that the former president disguised his ownership of a lucrative auto-parts maker under the name of relatives and embezzled 24 billion won from the company between 1995 and 2007. The court found that Samsung offered to bribe Mr. Lee in the form of paying his legal fees for settling a legal case that implicated the auto-parts company.The court said Samsung\u2019s bribes were approved by Lee Kun-hee, who has been incapacitated since a heart attack in 2014.In February, an appeals court convicted Lee Jae-yong, the son of Lee Kun-hee and a Samsung vice chairman, of bribing Ms. Park, who succeeded Lee Myung-bak as president.Samsung on Friday offered no immediate comment on the former president\u2019s conviction.Lee Myung-bak was also ordered to pay 13 billion won in fines. Mr. Lee, who did not appear in court on Friday, had a week to appeal. He vehemently denied any wrongdoing during his trial.\u201cDuring the hearings, he shifted the blame to his aides, accusing them of committing the crimes for their own profit and conspiring against him,\u201d Judge Chung said on Friday.Almost all of South Korea\u2019s former presidents, as well as many of its business tycoons, have been implicated in corruption scandals.Mr. Lee, a former Hyundai executive, won the presidency by promising to use his business skills to help rejuvenate the South Korean economy.

{"Headline": "U.S. Warns China on Weakening Currency as Trade Relations Worsen", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States is warning China to refrain from weakening its currency as a way to lessen the pain of President Trump\u2019s tariffs, with top American officials suggesting that any trade deal between the two countries should contain measures to prevent manipulation of the renminbi.The renminbi has fallen 6 percent against the dollar this year, raising concern that the Chinese government is intervening to help make its exports cheaper in the face of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods.The levies, which range from 10 percent to 25 percent, are making many Chinese products more expensive to sell into the United States. By lowering the value of its currency, China is making a United States dollar worth more, lessening that financial hit.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on Friday that he voiced his concerns about the weakening renminbi directly to Yi Gang, the governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund meetings in Indonesia this week. He described the discussion as \u201cconstructive.\u201dThe currency concerns are the latest wrinkle in increasingly strained relations between Washington and Beijing. They come as Mr. Trump is considering a meeting with Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, at the Group of 20 summit meeting in Argentina next month in hopes that the two leaders can defuse the escalating trade war and reach agreement on some sort of trade deal.He added that he wants a future trade agreement to include a currency provision similar to what was included in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. That deal, which revised the North American Free Trade Agreement, included a commitment by the three countries to avoid manipulating exchange rates and greater transparency in reporting data on international reserve balances.Mr. Mnuchin acknowledged that trade negotiations with China had taken a step backward in recent months, but insisted that his Chinese counterparts understood what concessions and changes the United States was seeking. Mr. Mnuchin signaled that a meeting with Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi would only take place if there were signs that talks between the two nations were making headway.\u201cWe\u2019ll see if we make progress, if that makes sense,\u201d he said.For months, American and Chinese officials have been holding back-channel discussions to try to break the trade stalemate. Formal, high-level talks have been scarce, however, as Mr. Trump has moved forward with tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports and Chinese leaders have insisted that they will not make a deal under duress. A Chinese delegation canceled a visit to Washington last month after the United States announced more tariffs and Mr. Trump responded by threatening to levy taxes on all Chinese imports.Mr. Trump has said several times that while China \u201cwants to make a deal,\u201d he does not believe it is ready to do so.As the trade war rages, administration officials have been increasingly wary that China is using alternate measures like currency manipulation to mitigate the effect of the tariffs.The issue has re-emerged ahead of the Treasury Department\u2019s widely anticipated biannual currency report that is expected next week. The study is the latest opportunity for Mr. Trump to make good on his campaign promise to label China a currency manipulator. But, despite those threats, the Treasury has so far declined to name China a manipulator in the three previous reports that have been released under the president\u2019s watch.In part, that is because China has not yet satisfied some of the criteria required to be labeled a currency manipulator, including bilateral trade deficits and other factors indicating a country is depressing the value of its currency. The United States has not officially called another country a manipulator since it slapped the label on China in 1994, and doing so is supposed to kick-start negotiations to resolve the problem.While the practical effect is minimal, brandishing the label in the coming report would only exacerbate tension between the two countries. Analysts do not expect the label to be applied in next week\u2019s report.Mr. Mnuchin declined on Friday to offer a preview of the Treasury\u2019s findings.\u201cWhat we go through on the report is a technical analysis that follows certain rules,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say what the result is, but this is a very thorough analysis.\u201dChristine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said this week that the strength of the dollar was exacerbating the appearance of the renminbi\u2019s weakness, but that, compared with other currencies, its value was declining only modestly.The Chinese economy has shown signs of slowing under the weight of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, while markets in the United States have been roiled recently in part because of lingering uncertainty about trade.After prior rounds of trade talks failed, some White House officials appear eager to let Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi cut a deal on their own.\u201cWe need those two guys to sit down and work it out,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, told the Fox Business Network on Friday. \u201cI think that the fact that they\u2019re talking suggests that there should be a great of hope that we can resolve our feud sometime soon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Khashoggi, a Tangled Mix of Royal Service and Islamist Sympathies", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Jamal Khashoggi landed in Washington last fall, leaving behind a long list of bad news back home.After a successful career as an adviser to and unofficial spokesman for the royal family of Saudi Arabia, he had been barred from writing in the kingdom, even on Twitter, by the new crown prince. His column in a Saudi-owned Arab newspaper was canceled. His marriage was collapsing. His relatives had been forbidden to travel to pressure him to stop criticizing the kingdom\u2019s rulers.Then, after he arrived in the United States, a wave of arrests put a number of his Saudi friends behind bars, and he made his difficult decision: It was too dangerous to return home anytime soon \u2014 and maybe forever.So in the United States, he reinvented himself as a critic, contributing columns to The Washington Post and believing he had found safety in the West.But as it turned out, the West\u2019s protection extended only so far.Saudi officials have denied harming Mr. Khashoggi, but nearly two weeks after his disappearance, they have failed to provide evidence that he left the consulate and have offered no credible account of what happened to him.His disappearance has opened a rift between Washington and Saudi Arabia, the chief Arab ally of the Trump administration. And it has badly damaged the reputation of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 33-year-old power behind the Saudi throne, who this time may have gone too far for even for his staunchest supporters in the West.While the disappearance has cast a harsh new light on the crown prince, it has also brought attention to the tangled sympathies throughout Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s career, where he balanced what appears to have been a private affinity for democracy and political Islam with his long service to the royal family.The idea of self-exile in the West was a blow for Mr. Khashoggi, 60, who had worked as a reporter, commentator and editor to become one of the kingdom\u2019s best known personalities. He first drew international attention for interviewing a young Osama bin Laden and later became well-known as a confidant of kings and princes.His career left him extraordinarily well-connected, and the tall, gregarious, easygoing man seemed to know everyone who had anything to do with Saudi Arabia over the last three decades.When his turn came to share what he was thankful for, he said: \u201cBecause I have become free, and I can write freely.\u201dAccording to interviews with dozens of people who knew Mr. Khashoggi and his relationship with the Saudi leadership, it was his penchant for writing freely, and his organizing to push for political reform from abroad, that put him on a collision course with the crown prince.While Saudi Arabia has long been ruled according to the consensus of senior princes, Crown Prince Mohammed has dismantled that system, leaving his own power largely unchecked. If a decision was taken to silence a perceived traitor, it likely would have been his.Mr. Khashoggi studied at Indiana State University and returned to Saudi Arabia to report for an English-language newspaper. Several of his friends say that early on Mr. Khashoggi also joined the Muslim Brotherhood.Although he later stopped attending meetings of the Brotherhood, he remained conversant in its conservative, Islamist and often anti-Western rhetoric, which he could deploy or hide depending on whom he was seeking to befriend.His newspaper colleagues recalled him as friendly, thoughtful and devout. He often led communal prayers in the newsroom, recalled Shahid Raza Burney, an Indian editor who worked with him.Like many Saudis in the 1980s, Mr. Khashoggi cheered for the jihad against the Soviets in Afghanistan, which was supported by the C.I.A. and Saudi Arabia. So when he got an invitation to see it for himself from another young Saudi, Bin Laden, Mr. Khashoggi jumped at the chance.In Afghanistan, Mr. Khashoggi wore local dress and had his photo taken holding an assault rifle, much to his editors\u2019 chagrin. But it does not appear that he actually fought while on assignment there.\u201cHe was there as a journalist first and foremost, admittedly as someone sympathetic to the Afghan jihad, but so were most Arab journalists at the time \u2014 and many Western journalists,\u201d said Thomas Hegghammer, a Norwegian researcher who interviewed Mr. Khashoggi about his time in Afghanistan.His colleagues concurred.\u201cTo say that Jamal was some kind of an extremist is all lies,\u201d said Mr. Burney, now a newspaper editor in India.But the war\u2019s failure to put Afghanistan on sound footing haunted Mr. Khashoggi, as did Bin Laden\u2019s later turn to terrorism.\u201cHe was disappointed that after all that struggle, the Afghans never got together,\u201d said a Saudi friend of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s trips to Afghanistan and his relationship with Prince Turki al-Faisal, who headed Saudi intelligence, made some of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s friends suspect he was also spying for the Saudi government.Years later, after American commandos killed Bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, Mr. Khashoggi mourned his old acquaintance and what he had become.\u201cI collapsed crying a while ago, heartbroken for you Abu Abdullah,\u201d Mr. Khashoggi wrote on Twitter, using Bin Laden\u2019s nickname. \u201cYou were beautiful and brave in those beautiful days in Afghanistan, before you surrendered to hatred and passion.\u201dAs his journalism career took off, Mr. Khashoggi reported from Algeria and drove into Kuwait during the first Gulf War. He climbed the ladder of the kingdom\u2019s media world, where princes own newspapers, content is censored and scandals involving royals are buried.After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, he blasted the conspiracy theories common in the Arab world, writing that the hijacked planes \u201calso attacked Islam as a faith and the values of tolerance and coexistence that it preaches.\u201dHe was named editor of the Saudi newspaper Al Watan in 2003, but fired less than two months later over an article blaming an esteemed Islamic scholar for teachings used to justify attacks on non-Muslims. He was reinstated in 2007 and lasted a bit longer in his second tenure.He traveled with King Abdullah and grew close to Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the billionaire investor, who was later arrested by Crown Prince Mohammed. Prince Turki, the former intelligence chief, hired Mr. Khashoggi as an adviser when he served as ambassador to Britain and the United States.It was during his time there that Mr. Khashoggi bought the condo in McLean, Va., where he would live after fleeing the kingdom.Many of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s friends say that throughout his career of service to the monarchy, he hid his personal leanings in favor of both electoral democracy and Muslim Brotherhood-style political Islam.When a military coup in Algeria in 1992 dashed the hopes of an Islamist political party to win control of the Parliament there, Mr. Khashoggi quietly teamed up with an Islamist friend in London to start an organization called \u201cThe Friends of Democracy in Algeria.\u201dThe group took out advertisements in newspapers in Britain before its parliamentary elections that read, \u201cWhen you go to cast your vote, remember that this is a bounty many people around the world are denied, including Algerians,\u201d recalled his friend, Azzam Tamimi, who acted as the public face of the effort and hid Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s role.By the time he reached his 50s, Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood was ambiguous. Several Muslim Brothers said this week that they always felt he was with them. Many of his secular friends would not have believed it.Mr. Khashoggi never called for more than gradual reforms to the Saudi monarchy, eventually supporting its military interventions to deter what the Saudis considered Iranian influence in Bahrain and Yemen. But he was enthusiastic about the uprisings that broke out across much of the Arab world in 2011.Like the Afghan jihad before them, however, the movements of the Arab Spring disappointed him as they collapsed into violence and as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates used their wealth to crush opposition and bolster autocrats.\u201cHe never liked that Saudi Arabia used their policies accelerating the crackdown around the region,\u201d said Sigurd Neubauer, a Middle East analyst in Washington who knew Mr. Khashoggi.The kingdom\u2019s tolerance for even minimal criticism faded after King Salman ascended to the throne in 2015 and gave tremendous power to his son, Mohammed, the crown prince known informally by his initials as M.B.S.Mr. Khashoggi applauded those moves, but chafed at the authoritarian way the prince wielded power. When Mr. Khashoggi criticized Mr. Trump after his election, for example, Saudi officials forbade him to speak, fearing he would harm their relationship with the new administration.Crown Prince Mohammed went after his critics with all his power, barring them from travel and throwing some in jail. Mr. Khashoggi left the kingdom last year, before scores of his friends were rounded up and hundreds of prominent Saudis were locked in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton on accusations of corruption. A number of them, including at least two sons of former kings, are still detained.Mr. Khashoggi began contributing columns to The Washington Post, comparing Crown Prince Mohammed to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s friends assumed such writing landed him on the prince\u2019s blacklist.\u201cMohammed bin Salman had been paying millions of dollars to create a certain image of himself, and Jamal Khashoggi was destroying all of it with just a few words,\u201d said Mr. Tamimi, the friend. \u201cThe crown prince must have been furious.\u201dBut Mr. Khashoggi didn\u2019t stop.He was planning to start a website to publish translated reports about the economies of Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, where he felt many people did not understand the scale of corruption or the limited future of the oil wealth.He was also founding an organization called Democracy in the Arab World Now, or DAWN, an advocacy group. Mr. Khashoggi was trying to secure funding and set up a board when he disappeared, friends said.Crown Prince Mohammed \u201cis investing hundreds of billions of dollars into future projects and he\u2019s doing that depending on his own ability to judge and the ability of a small circle of advisers,\u201d Mr. Khashoggi said. \u201cIs that enough? No, it is not enough.\u201dSince his move to Washington, representatives of Crown Prince Mohammed had contacted him repeatedly, asking him to tone down his criticisms and inviting him to come home, he told friends.Maggie Mitchell Salem, a longtime friend, worried about him and asked him to text her whenever he went to the Saudi Embassy in Washington.\u201cHe laughed at me: \u2018Oh, Maggie, Maggie, you are ridiculous\u2019,\u201d she recalled.Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut and David D. Kirkpatrick from Istanbul. Julian Barnes, Sharon LaFraniere, Edward Wong and Mark Mazzetti contributed reporting from Washington, and Karam Shoumali from Berlin.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Red-Meat Rallying Cry for National Republicans: California", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLAS VEGAS \u2014 Adam Laxalt, the Republican candidate for governor of Nevada, knows how to rile up a crowd this election season: Just point to the state to the west.\u201cAre we going to keep Nevada the Nevada we all love, this independent Western state, or are we going to turn into California?\u201d Mr. Laxalt asked at a rally in Elko with President Trump on Saturday.Mr. Trump jumped in a moment later, assailing California\u2019s embrace of so-called sanctuary cities, where local authorities limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. \u201cBy the way, a lot of people in California don\u2019t want them, either,\u201d he said of such cities. \u201cThey\u2019re rioting now.\u201d (Actually, they are not).It\u2019s not only in Nevada. California would seem to be on the ballot in a number of states where Republicans are facing tough re-election battles this fall. In Nevada, Texas, Colorado and Florida, California is being hoisted as a symbol of high taxes, liberal social policy, lax immigration enforcement and an interventionist government run amok. The state figures in laugh lines and attack lines wielded by candidates for the House and Senate, for governor and for state legislative seats.California has been a favorite object for political mockery since the days of the Free Speech Movement in Berkeley and Flower Power in Haight-Ashbury. But the attacks have escalated to a new level this year, as California has emerged as the blue face of opposition to Mr. Trump and his policies.On top of that, some Republicans, with their variations on the \u201cDon\u2019t let Nevada/Texas/Florida/Colorado turn into California\u201d line, appear to be appealing to former Californians who have fled to their states in search of lower taxes and less government, and presumably would be receptive to an I-hate-California appeal.There was a time when East Coast states filled this role. But since the death of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (or as it was called in Republican circles, \u201cTaxachusetts\u201d) is no longer as inviting a target as it once was. Republicans also have a harder time pointing to New York as a symbol of liberal excess when its most prominent resident now occupies the White House.With immigration looming as a key issue in this election cycle, California, where Latinos make up 40 percent of the population, would seem the right state for these times.As a result, the state seems to be joining Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader (who is from San Francisco) as a go-to motivator for Republican candidates looking for red-meat appeals to fire up supporters.\u201cEvery crazy thing, public policy-wise, that comes out of California is just anathema to entrepreneurs and average voters,\u201d said David M. Carney, a political consultant advising Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, a Republican running for re-election. \u201cThere\u2019s something about the aggressiveness of the craziness of California regulating every aspect of everyone\u2019s life that makes it a good example of what we don\u2019t want to be.\u201dMr. Abbott routinely begins his political speeches by pledging to build a wall \u2014 between Texas and New Mexico, \u201cso we can keep all the Californians out.\u201dThe Republican Governors Association issued a news release with this warning about the governor\u2019s race in Florida: \u201cDemocrat Andrew Gillum Wants Floridians To Pay California-Level Taxes.\u201d His Republican opponent, Ron DeSantis, picked up the theme as he campaigned in Sarasota.\u201cCalifornia is absolutely not the model for Florida,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be a historic mistake to go down the road of being a high-tax, high-spending state.\u201dCalifornians scoff at the attacks as reflecting envy of their state\u2019s soaring coastlines and bright-blue skies, where Americans have been streaming for almost 200 years.\u201cThis is another sorry example of the current state of Republican solipsism,\u201d said Jerry Brown, the Democratic governor. \u201cThe irony is that when they attack California, they attack the very engine of America\u2019s prosperity and leadership.\u201dTom Steyer, a billionaire environmentalist from San Francisco, whose organization has financed campaigns against Republicans in 11 states, including Florida and Nevada, said the attacks were a cynical political tactic aimed at diverting voters\u2019 attention from issues Republicans do not want to talk about, like health care.\u201cDo I think California is perfect?\u201d Mr. Steyer said. \u201cHell, no. But do I think we have a functioning democracy that is trying to deal with these issues? I think we do.\u201dIn some ways, California makes itself an easy target, with laws regulating plastic bags and, this year, plastic straws \u2014 the kind of restrictions that would seem particular anathema to voters in states like Nevada, Colorado and Texas with deep Western skepticism about big government. But it\u2019s not only the smaller issues: California has come to represent a vision of government \u2014 expansive and expensive \u2014 than is not nearly as welcome in swing states like Nevada.\u201cThe Californians come here, and they want to change things around,\u201d said Patrick Casale, 57, a health insurance broker and Republican who lives in Las Vegas. \u201cThey want us to pay more taxes. They want to make Nevada a sanctuary state. They want to impose their way of life on us.\u201dThere is wariness not only of California, analysts from both parties say, but also of the ethnic diversity that California has come to represent. \u201cThere is a little bit of coded language there \u2014 about \u2018the other,\u2019\u201d said David Damore, a professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\u201cThey don\u2019t have much to campaign on substantively,\u201d Mr. Damore said of Republican candidates generally. \u201cThey are not campaigning on the tax cuts. The Affordable Care Act blew up in their face. So they are trying to draw support from the idea that our way of life is under attack.\u201dIn the Colorado race for governor, the Republican Governors Association weighed in early with an advertisement titled \u201cRadiCalifornia.\u201d It was directed at the Democrat in the race, Representative Jared Polis, who is running against Walker Stapleton, the Republican state treasurer.\u201cJared Polis wants to turn Colorado into RadiCalifornia,\u201d the announcer said. \u201cPolis wants higher taxes. Polis wants to put tens of thousands of energy jobs at risk. And you can forget fixing our traffic problems.\u201dBut David Flaherty, a Republican pollster in Colorado, said he believed that advertisement had fallen flat.\u201cAre Californians moving here and changing our state, which is arguably what happened in Nevada?\u201d Mr. Flaherty asked. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that is a prevailing thought in voters\u2019 minds. We are not there yet.\u201dWilliam McCurdy II, the Democratic leader in Nevada, said he had become inured to the invocations of California by Mr. Heller and Mr. Laxalt, who is the state attorney general, and doubted they would make much difference.\u201cWhat they are doing is looking at another state and fear-mongering,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t resonate with a majority of Nevadans, who care about issues like health care and economy.\u201dStill, candidates and strategists say Republicans are tapping into a genuine concern with this line of attack.Jeff Hays, the Republican leader in Colorado, said he has seen rising resentment among some Coloradans over an influx of Californians.\u201cWe don\u2019t want the housing costs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the traffic problems. We don\u2019t want the taxes. There\u2019s a fear of urbanization, because that\u2019s where you get a lot of the problems \u2014 the crime, the congestion, the overregulation.\u201d\u201cAnd the plastic straw ban,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you serious?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Embarks on Bilateral Trade Talks to Pressure China", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Fresh off securing trade agreements with South Korea, Canada and Mexico, President Trump is embarking on a new plan: refashioning the Trans-Pacific Partnership to his liking through a flurry of bilateral trade deals.Mr. Trump, who pulled the United States out of the trade pact with 11 other countries that he has called a \u201crape of our country,\u201d is now looking to forge deeper trade ties with several of the nations in the alliance, as well as the European Union and the United Kingdom.But while the Trans-Pacific Partnership was aimed at encouraging China to make the extensive economic and structural overhauls that would someday win it a place in the trade pact, Mr. Trump views these new bilateral agreements as a way to contain Beijing\u2019s growing economic, geopolitical and territorial ambitions.The White House gave formal notification to Congress this week that it would begin trade talks with Japan, the European Union and the United Kingdom. And the administration also has its sights on free trade agreements with the Philippines and Vietnam, as part of its effort to fence in China with agreements in its backyard.China is racing ahead with its own plan for somewhat more free trade in Asia through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, which would sharply reduce tariffs on trade within Asia, tying Asian markets more closely to China. The Chinese-backed pact is taking shape as a fairly narrow trade agreement, however. Unlike the Trans-Pacific Partnership or the bilateral free trade agreements envisioned by the Trump administration, it would not impose minimum labor standards or restrictions on state-owned enterprises.The Trump administration views the labor, manufacturing and other concessions it won in the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which replaces the North American Free Trade Agreement, as a template for future trade deals, particularly with Asia.Among the most important provisions the White House wants to replicate in future deals is imposing limits on the ability of trading partners to strike separate deals with China. The new pact with Mexico and Canada severely limits their ability to reach separate free-trade deals with a nonmarket economy \u2014 a provision clearly aimed at Beijing. Negotiating similar language in agreements with China\u2019s neighbors could pose a particular challenge to Beijing\u2019s efforts to more closely tie itself to other Asian nations.The administration also wants to bake in the potential to renegotiate trade deals more frequently so the United States can ensure trade terms remain in its favor. The U.S.M.C.A. has a fixed term of 16 years, which means that the United States could ask for another round of trade concessions at its expiration. That emphasis on renegotiation partly comes out of the American experience with China, which entered the World Trade Organization on terms tailored for developing countries. It has since turned into the world\u2019s largest manufacturer but still keeps the provisions that allow it to maintain high barriers to imports.The U.S.M.C.A. also excludes state-owned enterprises, of which China has many, from benefiting from lower tariffs. And it contains a prohibition on currency manipulation, which the administration wants to push for in other trade deals.Mr. Trump has repeatedly accused several trading partners, including Europe and China, of artificially weakening their currency to make exports cheaper.On Wednesday, the Treasury Department said China, Germany, India, Japan, Korea and Switzerland would remain on its \u201cmonitoring list\u201d for potential currency manipulation but declined to officially label any nation a currency manipulator.While Treasury determined that China\u2019s direct intervention to reduce the value of its currency has been \u201climited,\u201d it said Beijing\u2019s practices deserve ongoing scrutiny.\u201cOf particular concern are China\u2019s lack of currency transparency and recent weakness in the currency,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement. \u201cThese pose major challenges to achieving fairer and more balanced trade, and we will continue to monitor and review China\u2019s currency practices, including ongoing discussions with the People\u2019s Bank of China.\u201dLast week, Mr. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, signaled at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual meetings that the United States would look to make the deal with Mexico and Canada a model for future agreements. Pointing to the currency provision in the deal during an interview with CNBC, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s going to be important going forward for trade negotiations.\u201dWhether the Trump administration can secure such provisions in future trade deals remains to be seen. But Mr. Trump, emboldened by recent trade \u201cwins\u201d secured by the threat of automobile tariffs, is preparing to test with more formidable economies his strategy of pummeling trade partners into submission.Over the summer, Mr. Trump threatened \u201ctremendous retribution\u201d against Europe in the form of car tariffs, before backing off ahead of negotiations. During the talks with Canada last month, Mr. Trump repeatedly threatened to tax Canadian cars, even suggesting that tariffs could be better than a deal.On Wednesday, Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, expressed frustration with the pace of talks and suggested intransigence on the part of the European Union. \u201cThe president\u2019s patience is not unlimited,\u201d Mr. Ross told reporters in Brussels after a meeting with senior European officials.Earlier on Wednesday, Cecilia Malmstrom, the European trade commissioner, said the United States \u201chas not shown any big interest\u201d in an offer by Brussels to begin discussing a limited agreement focused on industrial goods.\u201cThe ball is in their court,\u201d she said.The administration\u2019s preference for striking bilateral deals is prompting criticism from some former trade officials, who warn that such agreements are likely to be narrower and foster less investment and long-term cooperation than the broad trading bloc envisioned by the Obama administration with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\u201cI think it is likely to be much more difficult to get the same strategic and architectural benefits out of a series of bilateral agreements as you might out of a major regional agreement, and certainly not in the same time frame,\u201d said Michael Froman, who was the United States trade representative in the second term of the Obama administration.Opening negotiations with the Philippines could prove especially problematic as the United States grapples with maintaining its economic and diplomatic ties to Saudi Arabia after the disappearance of a Saudi dissident journalist in Turkey this month. The administration is already under fire for prioritizing financial ties above concern for the journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, who the Turks say was killed by the Saudis.Democrats, who could win control of the House of Representatives in November\u2019s elections, are already gearing up for a trade fight with Mr. Trump and rejecting any United States embrace of Mr. Duterte on trade. Finalizing a major trade pact without bipartisan support would be impossible next year if Republicans lose either the House or the Senate.\u201cThis is yet another example of President Trump admiring and rewarding authoritarians,\u201d said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, in reference to speculation that talks with the Philippines could soon begin.The Philippines was excluded from the Obama-era Trans-Pacific Partnership because its high tariffs and other trade barriers for keeping out foreign competition appeared to be an insurmountable obstacle. Strong interest groups in the Philippines want to keep those trade barriers, including wealthy families that own companies that benefit from limiting foreign competition.Instead, the United States turned its attention to Vietnam, which also has high trade barriers, but which the Obama administration viewed as a unified Communist government with the political will to force through market-opening measures.\u201cThe work has already been done,\u201d said Chad Bown, an economist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noting that a detailed outline of new trading terms had already been drawn for a developing country such as Vietnam. \u201cIt makes sense to go back to them.\u201dJack Ewing contributed reporting from Brussels.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Ethiopia Appoints Its First Female President", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia \u2014 A week after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed of Ethiopia filled half of his new cabinet with women in a radical overhaul, the country\u2019s Parliament took another step toward gender parity on Thursday by appointing the country\u2019s first female president.Sahle-Work Zewde, 68, a seasoned diplomat who has held positions in the United Nations and worked in peacekeeping operations in Africa, accepted the position following the unprecedented appointments of women to lead the Defense Ministry and the secret intelligence agency, a long-feared state organ that recently got a face-lift. (It is now called the Ministry of Peace.)Though the position of president is considered largely ceremonial, involving opening Parliament and appointing ambassadors, the decision to place Ms. Sahle-Work in the role carries significant symbolic weight, said Selam Musse, a gender and media consultant based in Addis Ababa, the capital.Having a female leader \u201cspeaks volumes for women and knocks on every door,\u201d she said, \u201cespecially in a country where patriarchy plays a decisive role in political, social and economic structure of our country\u2019s politics.\u201dHis latest moves are part of a \u201creform mentality within the ruling party, a general push towards shaking up the bureaucracy,\u201d said Jason Mosley, a research associate at the African Studies Center at Oxford University. \u201cEthiopia still is, despite all the development, a conservative culture on average. It\u2019s still mostly rural, and many women don\u2019t have equal opportunities as men.\u201dThe sudden changes have burst old wounds, prompting violence in various parts of the country where ethnic tensions run particularly high. Still, appointments of people such as Ms. Sahle-Work, a relative outsider to the inner politics of the ruling coalition, are thought to pacify critics worried about ethnic or political affiliations poisoning effective leadership.\u201cI am a product of people who fought for equality and political freedom in this country, and I will work hard to serve them,\u201d Ms. Sahle-Work said in her acceptance speech to Parliament.She also promised to work on issues concerning women. \u201cIf you thought I spoke a lot about women already, know that I am just getting started,\u201d she said in a quote that was widely circulated among social media users in Ethiopia.Ms. Sahle-Work was appointed in June by the United Nations secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, as his special representative to the African Union and head of the United Nations Office to the African Union as under secretary general. She was previously director general of the United Nations office in Nairobi, Kenya.Women are more prone to disease than men, the study said, and although half of the country\u2019s labor force is made up of women, a majority of them are unpaid because most work as farm laborers. Female genital cutting and child marriages are still prevalent, particularly in rural areas, which make up about 80 percent of the country.\u201cWe need a bold leader who actually sees women beyond being mothers and sisters but be inspirations and let others become role models,\u201d Ms. Selam said.Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second most-populous country and one that 30 years ago was a byword for famine, is more organized, ambitious and centrally controlled than many other governments on the continent \u2014 the ruling coalition intends to transform it into a middle-income country by 2025.Despite the staggering pace of progress, it is still a deeply authoritarian state \u2014 though Mr. Mosley said that was precisely what has allowed Mr. Abiy to change things so quickly.\u201cYou can have these kind of radical overhauls of gender balancing a cabinet when it\u2019s authoritarian,\u201d Mr. Mosley said. \u201cAll the trade-offs necessary in a more competitive political landscape are part of the thing that keeps Western democracies from achieving these kind of results.\u201dHadra Ahmed reported from Addis Ababa, and Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Dire Climate Warning Lands With a Thud on Trump\u2019s Desk", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president\u2019s isolation is not just from the world: In California, New York, Massachusetts and other states, governments and companies are pushing ahead with regulations and technological innovations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\u201cYou have this enormous discrepancy between the White House and, essentially, everyone else,\u201d said Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, the director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. \u201cThe leadership in Washington is really moving against the whole agenda.\u201dThe United Nations report paints a far more dire picture of the immediate consequences of climate change than previously thought and says that avoiding the damage requires transforming the world economy at a speed and scale that has \u201cno documented historic precedent.\u201dIt describes a world of worsening food shortages and poverty; more wildfires; and a mass die-off of coral reefs as soon as 2040 \u2014 a period well within the lifetime of much of the global population.Among climate-change scientists, there were increasing fears that Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris accord, which at first seemed a lonely act of defiance, may embolden other countries to leave it as well.Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement last year prompted a show of solidarity from the other 194 countries that signed the accord, not to mention American political and business leaders who rallied under the slogan, \u201cWe are still in!\u201d But to populists like Mr. Bolsonaro, Mr. Trump\u2019s demands that the United States be given a better deal could prove appealing.Beyond the domino effect, Mr. Holdren, who is now a professor at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School, said there were other immediate costs to what he called \u201cthe squandering of U.S. leadership on an acute global issue.\u201dMr. Trump, who has mocked the science of human-caused climate change, cut the American contribution to a global fund that supports climate mitigation and assistance efforts in developing countries by two-thirds, to $1 billion. He has tried to cut government funding of climate-related research \u2014 an effort that Congress has so far resisted.The White House issued no public response to the United Nations report, which was issued Monday in South Korea at a meeting of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of scientists convened by the United Nations to guide world leaders.\u201cNot today,\u201d said Bill Shine, the White House communications director. \u201cIt\u2019s a Kavanaugh night.\u201dAfter Mr. Trump returned Monday from Orlando, Fla., where he spoke to a convention of police chiefs and referred to the hurricane now approaching that state, he attended a White House ceremony to swear in Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh as an associate justice of the Supreme Court.Following the ceremony, Lindsay E. Walters, a deputy press secretary, said, \u201cThe United States is leading the world in providing affordable, abundant and secure energy to our citizens, while protecting the environment and reducing emissions through job-creating innovation.\u201dShe noted that carbon dioxide-related emissions declined 14 percent in the United States from 2005 to 2017, while they rose 21 percent globally during the same period.On Saturday, an American delegation in South Korea joined more than 180 countries in accepting the report\u2019s summary for policymakers, but a statement from the State Department added that it \u201cdoes not imply endorsement by the United States of the specific findings or underlying contents of the report.\u201dThe report \u201cis quite a shock, and quite concerning,\u201d said Bill Hare, an author of previous Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports and a physicist with Climate Analytics, a nonprofit organization. \u201cWe were not aware of this just a few years ago.\u201dThe authors found that if greenhouse gas emissions continue at the current rate, the atmosphere will warm by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, or 1.5 degrees Celsius, above preindustrial levels by 2040.The Paris accord set a goal of preventing warming of more than 3.6 degrees above preindustrial levels \u2014 long considered a threshold for the most severe social and economic damage from climate change. But the heads of small island nations, fearful of rising sea levels, had also asked scientists to examine the effects of 2.7 degrees of warming.Without aggressive action, many effects that scientists once expected to happen further in the future will arrive by 2040, and at the lower temperature, the report shows.\u201cIt\u2019s telling us we need to reverse emissions trends and turn the world economy on a dime,\u201d said Myles Allen, an Oxford University climate scientist and an author of the report.To prevent 2.7 degrees of warming, the report said, greenhouse emissions must be reduced by 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, and by 100 percent by 2050. It also found that use of coal as an electricity source would have to drop from nearly 40 percent today to 1 to 7 percent by 2050.\u201cThis report makes it clear: There is no way to mitigate climate change without getting rid of coal,\u201d said Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University and an author of the report. Mr. Trump has vowed to increase the burning of coal.\u201cIt makes me feel angry when I think about the U.S. government,\u201d Mr. Shindell said. \u201cMy kids feel like it\u2019s their future being destroyed.\u201d He watched as the grounds of his son\u2019s high school in Durham, N.C., and the roads around it flooded last month after Hurricane Florence.Dr. Allen said there was little question the report will be ignored in Washington. \u201cThe current administration doesn\u2019t seem interested in it all,\u201d he said, although he added that as a scientist, he takes the long view.\u201cOne way or another,\u201d he said, \u201cthe facts do win out.\u201dMr. Trump encouraged scientists recently when he nominated Kelvin Droegemeier, a well-respected meteorologist who is an expert on extreme weather, to lead the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. The post had been vacant since Mr. Trump took office.But it is unlikely that Mr. Droegemeier will change the president\u2019s views on climate change, and other influential aides are hardly going to challenge him.For example, the Trump administration\u2019s counterterrorism strategy, released last week, made no mention of climate change as a cause for extremism. The Obama administration regularly cited it in threat assessments because of its effect on migration and the competition for food and water.\u201cI don\u2019t think climate change is a cause of international terrorism,\u201d said the national security adviser, John R. Bolton.For all that, scientists said that they saw a few rays of sunshine amid the clouds. A Democratic takeover of the House would raise the odds that Congress would continue blocking cuts to research. And despite his criticism of the Paris accord as \u201cvery unfair\u201d to the United States, Mr. Trump has left the door open to staying in the deal, if the terms were improved.\u201cI have been of the opinion all along that we can definitely see the U.S. back in the Paris agreement, even under Trump,\u201d Mr. Rockstr\u00f6m said.Legally, he noted, the United States cannot formally withdraw from the pact until 2020, and the agreement\u2019s terms are voluntary.\u201cHe can sit there in the White House and draw up his own plan,\u201d Mr. Rockstr\u00f6m said.Mark Landler reported from Washington, and Coral Davenport from Incheon, South Korea.

And having a small sample is only one possible source of error. To preserve privacy, exact addresses have been concealed. The locations shown here are approximate.Based on 428 interviewsBased on 428 interviewsThis district, in the exurbs west of Chicago, has long had a Republican bent.

The changes in the timeline below reflect that sampling error, not real changes in the race.One reason we\u2019re doing these surveys live is so you can see the uncertainty for yourself. There\u2019s a big question on top of the standard margin of error in a poll: Who is going to vote? It\u2019s a particularly challenging question this year, since special elections have shown Democrats voting in large numbers.To estimate the likely electorate, we combine what people say about how likely they are to vote with information about how often they have voted in the past. In previous races, this approach has been more accurate than simply taking people at their word. But there are many other ways to do it.All estimates based on 428 interviewsEven if we got turnout exactly right, the margin of error wouldn\u2019t capture all of the error in a poll. The simplest version assumes we have a perfect random sample of the voting population. We do not.People who respond to surveys are almost always too old, too white, too educated and too politically engaged to accurately represent everyone.Based on administrative records. Some characteristics are missing or incorrect. Many voters are called multiple times.Pollsters compensate by giving more weight to respondents from under-represented groups.

If they were to break 5 to 1 in favor of Republicans, that alone would be enough to change the lead in our poll, assuming we did everything else perfectly.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Newest Fed Nominee Faces G.O.P. Opposition", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump\u2019s decision to nominate Nellie Liang, a seasoned financial regulator, to the Federal Reserve\u2019s board of governors is eliciting a rare show of public opposition from some Senate Republicans, who want the Fed to loosen its grip on large banks.Those Republicans, including members of the Senate Banking Committee, have continued to express concerns about Ms. Liang\u2019s record on financial regulation despite continuing efforts by the White House and by the Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, to make the case for Mr. Trump\u2019s pick.Ms. Liang, 60, is a longtime Fed official who played a major role in the construction of stronger regulations after the 2008 financial crisis. In the years afterward, she led a new department focused on monitoring financial stability. She left the Fed last year to join the Brookings Institution, where she is a senior fellow in economic studies.A spokesman for Senator Thom Tillis, Republican of North Carolina, said on Tuesday that he had \u201cserious concerns about Nellie Liang due to several policy positions she laid out during her time\u201d at the Brookings Institution.Describing the Fed as a \u201crogue agency\u201d engaged in \u201ctrying to sabotage the Trump economic recovery,\u201d Mr. Lewandowski urged Mr. Trump to \u201cfire a torpedo across the bow of the Fed\u201d by reversing his own decision and withdrawing Ms. Liang\u2019s nomination. Mr. Lewandowski added that if the Fed persisted in raising rates, Mr. Trump should consider asking for Mr. Powell\u2019s resignation.Mr. Powell has praised Ms. Liang in conversations with Senate Republicans.But representatives of the banking industry almost immediately began to quietly make the case to Senate Republicans that it would be a mistake to confirm Ms. Liang. They argued she might seek to impede congressional efforts to reduce the burden of postcrisis regulations.Mr. Tillis, whose state is home to Bank of America, the nation\u2019s second-largest bank, has been the most outspoken member of the Senate Banking Committee in expressing concerns.One example: Republicans want the Fed to provide banks with advance information about the details of its annual stress test, which requires banks to demonstrate they have the strength to weather a financial crisis. Ms. Liang, who played a leading role in the creation of the stress tests, has expressed support for some measures that might ease the burden of the annual tests. But she, along with other former Fed officials, has cautioned that providing too much information could undermine the tests by allowing banks to essentially game the system.Adam Webb, the spokesman for Mr. Tillis, said Ms. Liang was not sufficiently supportive of the calls for increased transparency.\u201cIt is not clear that Ms. Liang will be an advocate for reducing some of the undue burden regulations place on banks all across the U.S.,\u201d Mr. Webb said.As a member of the Fed\u2019s board of governors, Ms. Liang would hold one of seven votes on regulatory issues. She would also serve as a voting member of the Fed\u2019s monetary policy committee.The Fed's vice chairman for supervision, Randal K. Quarles, would remain the lead official on regulatory issues. But Ian Katz, a financial policy analyst at Capital Alpha Partners, a research firm for investors, said Ms. Liang, by virtue of her experience, would almost certainly play an influential role.\u201cShe\u2019s made her career on financial stability issues, and I would fully expect her to be an influential voice,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you\u2019d like to see less regulation and looser oversight, then this isn\u2019t who you\u2019d pick. You may think she would be too quick to put the brakes on or to rein in certain activities.\u201dA spokesman for Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho and the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said Tuesday that he was aware of the concerns that some Republicans had expressed about Ms. Liang and that he was keeping an open mind. Mr. Crapo has not yet met with Ms. Liang.Steve Kelly, a spokesman for Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said that the lawmaker also had concerns about Ms. Liang\u2019s views on regulation, but added that Mr. Toomey was keeping an open mind and looking forward to meeting with Ms. Liang.The banking committee has not scheduled a hearing for Ms. Liang, and there is a chance that her nomination could expire if lawmakers do not act before the next Congress takes office in January. In that event, Mr. Trump could either re-up her nomination or choose another candidate.Mr. Trump previously nominated candidates for two other vacancies on the Fed\u2019s board. One of those nominees, Michelle Bowman, the head of banking regulation in Kansas, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate after the November elections. But the Republican leadership has not scheduled a vote on the other nominee, Marvin Goodfriend, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University.Follow Binyamin Appelbaum on Twitter @bcappelbaum.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Income Investors Finally Have a Chance to Cash In", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFor the first time since the financial crisis, playing it safe is paying off for income investors.After a decade when conservative money market funds and similar short-term investments yielded close to zero, it is now possible to earn about 2 percent and even a bit more.Lately, pocketing a 2 percent to 3 percent return owning cash is better than the performance of popular core bond funds that track the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index.That\u2019s because bond fund returns have two components: the interest paid by the bonds and changes in bond prices. When interest rates rise, prices fall. A bond statistic called duration estimates a portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to rate changes; the longer a portfolio\u2019s duration, the bigger its price loss when rates rise.Core bond funds that track the aggregate index have a duration of around six years, considered intermediate-term in bond parlance. That means when interest rates rise one percentage point, the index\u2019s bond prices will fall 6 percent. Over the past year, rising interest rates lifted the yield on core bond funds above 3 percent, but that was not enough income to offset price declines.Morningstar Direct reports that ultrashort-term bond funds \u2014 portfolios with durations below one year \u2014 have had the highest net inflows among all types of taxable bond funds for six consecutive months through August.\u201cImplicitly, that is trying to time the market,\u201d Ms. Jones said, and such behavior can hurt investor returns.For example, in the 12 months through February 2009 \u2014 the heart of the last stock meltdown \u2014 intermediate-term bonds rallied 5 percent and Treasury bills gained 1.3 percent.Moreover, if you\u2019re worried about a bond bear market, it\u2019s time to check your rearview mirror.With inflation still in check, expectations are that longer-term interest rates may already be near a peak. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note has risen to 3.1 percent recently from 1.4 percent in July 2016.That means you and your core bond fund have probably already lived through what passes for a bond bear market in this economic cycle. The aggregate index has lost a grand total of less than two percentage points since July 2016.If your current fixed-income strategy is simply to own a core bond fund that tracks the aggregate index, you can reduce the duration by adding shorter-term mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, or even cash.Shifting some money out of a core bond fund can also be an opportunity to add diversification in securities that are not included in the index.With the same outlook for the economy, Mr. Fredericks said he had placed nearly 30 percent of the BlackRock Multi-Asset Income fund\u2019s assets in high-yield corporate bonds and floating rate loans, which are usually high-yield issues. That said, BlackRock is being careful, he said. \u201cOur focus is on higher-quality high yield. Even if we find ourselves in recession, those companies are better positioned to weather it,\u201d he said.The resurrection of short-term yields merits two more portfolio considerations.Once you\u2019ve got your tweaking done, you might relax. \u201cThe whole idea of fixed income is you don\u2019t have to worry about it if you have it invested properly,\u201d Ms. Jones said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Mia Love, Sole Black Republican Woman in Congress, Fights for Her Seat", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMILLCREEK, Utah \u2014 Ben McAdams, a candidate for Congress, was speed-walking along the highway shoulder in his business suit, safety and common sense be damned.\u201cWe\u2019ll make it,\u201d he said, as the trucks whistled by, blowing dust into the Utah sun.In his bid to unseat Representative Mia Love, a Republican, Mr. McAdams has been trying to do just that \u2014 make it, in this case to the United States House as a Democrat from a state that runs about as red as the desert is dry. The district he seeks to represent, Utah\u2019s Fourth, is a boot-shaped expanse extending south from Salt Lake City where fewer than 15 percent of the voters are registered Democrats.In any other year, a McAdams win would seem improbable.Nationally, Democrats see the district as one of their best chances to move into red territory. And if Mr. McAdams plays it just right, there is bipartisan acknowledgment that he could win, particularly because he is the twice-elected mayor of Salt Lake County, home to 85 percent of the district.\u201cShe and other congressional Republicans have failed us in their moral duty,\u201d said Jordan Roberts, 33, a doctor and former Republican who rushed through a crowd to speak with Mr. McAdams at the opening of a new health clinic near the highway. \u201cI feel like she\u2019s been a yes-man for the current administration.\u201dNow, Mr. McAdams, 43, is crisscrossing the region like a Mormon missionary (he was one, in Brazil), wearing a tidy haircut and a grin and trying to convince voters that he\u2019s the centrist alternative to the president, the swamp and anyone tied to them, including Ms. Love.\u201cMia Love,\u201d he said on a recent day at his campaign office, where his cardboard cutout smiles from a corner, \u201chas essentially taken her vote and handed it over to somebody who doesn\u2019t have the best interest of Utah at heart.\u201dBut this is a challenging argument for Mr. McAdams to make, given that his opponent is no obvious symbol of the party establishment. Ms. Love, 42, is the daughter of Haitian immigrants, a convert to the Mormon Church who began her political career fighting a mosquito problem in her hometown, Saratoga Springs, Utah. After a stint as mayor, she became the first black Republican woman elected to Congress, in 2014.She frequently criticizes Mr. Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigration. And for many Mormons \u2014 who see themselves as a once-persecuted group \u2014 she is an important voice to have in Congress.\u201cHe\u2019s completely out of touch with what people want,\u201d Ms. Love said of Mr. McAdams. She has at times mocked her opponent\u2019s attempts to cast himself as a centrist, pointing to his past votes against abortion restrictions and his support of the Clintons as evidence that he would push through a liberal agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important that we keep the seat.\u201dWhile Mr. McAdams\u2019s supporters see him riding the blue wave into Washington, Ms. Love and her staff members are convinced she will return to the capital along with one of her biggest supporters, Mitt Romney, who is running for Senate.\u201cWhen Romney is on the ticket, people turn out,\u201d said Abby Evans, Ms. Love\u2019s data director. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really a blue wave district.\u201dUtah\u2019s Fourth District is its newest, and it includes a sliver of the relatively progressive Salt Lake City, as well as fast-expanding suburbs like West Jordan, where freshly built subdivisions sit amid temples steepled by golden statues of the angel Moroni, all of it backed by the towering Wasatch Range.Still, liberal forces have gained a small hold in this area, and conversations about the future now include religious leaders, right-leaning politicians, a Democratic minority, immigrant groups and gay activists, as well as developers and technology companies interested in the state\u2019s booming economy.Over the last decade, Mr. McAdams, a lawyer and a seventh-generation Utahn, has tried to position himself as a bridge between these disparate camps, and he is well known for negotiating a deal among church members, Republicans and the gay community on a nondiscrimination ordinance.

{"Headline": "With a Growing Urgency, Boris Johnson Grabs the Limelight", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBIRMINGHAM, England \u2014 The lines began building two hours before Britain\u2019s former foreign secretary Boris Johnson walked into the 1,500-seat hall, to be greeted by wild cheers and a noisy ovation. As his speech reached a climax, there were uncontrolled whoops of joy.Like him or loathe him \u2014 and there are many in both camps \u2014 it was impossible to ignore Mr. Johnson, whose appearance on Tuesday at the Conservative Party\u2019s annual conference overshadowed an announcement on immigration policy from the person whose job he so obviously craves: Prime Minister Theresa May.But there also seemed to be an element of desperation beneath Mr. Johnson\u2019s ill-disguised ambition.\u201cHe\u2019s aware that his political tide is seeping away,\u201d said Richard Hayton, an associate professor of politics at the University of Leeds. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t get the leadership in the aftermath of what will happen over Brexit in the next few months, it will pass him by for a new generation.\u201dMr. Johnson made a damning, if familiar, attack on Mrs. May\u2019s plan for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, known as Brexit \u2014 a blueprint that would keep some close economic ties to the bloc to minimize disruption to trade and protect the economy.A leader of the victorious pro-Brexit referendum campaign, Mr. Johnson favors a cleaner, more brutal break, and his speech appeared calculated to deepen a split within the Conservative Party that threatens to unseat Mrs. May and wreck her government.Her proposals \u2014 called the Chequers plan after the country residence where they were forged \u2014 are dangerous, unstable, an outrage and a cheat, and they amount to a political humiliation, Mr. Johnson said.Eloquent, charismatic and utterly incorrigible, Mr. Johnson is one of the best-known personalities in British politics, famous for his ruffled hair and his flair for both the English language and publicity.Six months ago Mr. Johnson seemed a beleaguered figure as foreign secretary, one of the biggest jobs in government but one that also exposed some of his shortcomings as a politician.However, his resignation from the cabinet over the Chequers plan has revived his popularity in the hard-line, pro-Brexit faction of the party. Recently, he almost seemed to be auditioning for the role of Britain\u2019s Donald Trump \u2014 whose negotiating skills he has compared favorably with those of Mrs. May \u2014 likening Muslim women who wear burqas to mailboxes and seeming to make common cause with Steve Bannon, the former White House strategist who is a champion of right-wing populism.The idea, analysts say, is to nail down the Brexit supporters within the Conservative Party, which could be decisive in any intraparty vote for the next party leader, who would then become prime minister. Party members are disproportionately older and in favor of Brexit.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a unifying \u2018leave\u2019 figure and they want to be able to unite behind a candidate, so there is some political space for Boris,\u201d Mr. Hayton said.On Tuesday Mr. Johnson\u2019s speech overshadowed an announcement from Mrs. May and her home secretary, Sajid Javid, that after Brexit, a new plan would remove favorable immigration status for European Union citizens. Mr. Javid also called for a crackdown on middle-class drug users.Predictably, though, it was Mr. Johnson who dominated the headlines even if there was no hint from him of any imminent bid for the leadership. That suggests that Mr. Johnson thinks that the crisis over Brexit needs to gather pace before a challenge against Mrs. May could succeed.Still, there is no guarantee that Mr. Johnson would win a leadership fight. Some colleagues suspect that he adopted the Brexit cause not so much from conviction as to increase his prospects of becoming party leader. Many fellow Conservative lawmakers are scathing about him.In an interview with The Daily Mail, Philip Hammond, the chancellor, dismissed Mr. Johnson as a man unable to grasp detail and predicted that he would never become prime minister.On Tuesday, David Gauke, the justice secretary, told the BBC that while Mr. Johnson \u201calways attracts lots of attention,\u201d it was time for the \u201ccredible and serious leadership\u201d that Mrs. May offers.\u201cThe question is whether there is just too much anger among colleagues to see him get anywhere near the leadership,\u201d said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London, referring to Mr. Johnson.Others fancy their chances, too, and the party conference has been something of a beauty contest among potential successors to Mrs. May, whose leadership has been in question since she lost her parliamentary majority last year. Possible contenders include Mr. Javid, Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, and Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary.Although she insists she does not want the job, Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives and a gay mother-to-be, has emerged as a potential leader who could change perceptions of a party that frets about its chronic lack of appeal to younger voters.However, it is unwise to underestimate Mr. Johnson, whose star quality still marks him out in a field of mainly drab competitors.And if nothing else, Mr. Johnson\u2019s ruthless courtship of the party\u2019s right wing has shaped the debate over the succession to Mrs. May, encouraging other contenders to ratchet up their anti-European rhetoric to win support from Euroskeptic activists.That may explain some jarring comments from Mr. Hunt \u2014 Mr. Johnson\u2019s successor as foreign secretary \u2014 who compared the European Union to the Soviet Union.Reactions to those remarks included one from Vytenis Andriukaitis, a European Commission member from Lithuania, who offered to explain the differences between the two entities from the standpoint of someone who works in Brussels and was born in a Soviet gulag.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Jamal Khashoggi Body Double Created False Trail in Turkey, Surveillance Images Suggest", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe team of Saudi agents that killed the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul brought a body double who resembled Mr. Khashoggi and wore his clothes as part of a cover-up, Turkish and Saudi officials said Monday.Turkey leaked security camera video footage on Monday showing the look-alike strolling the streets of Istanbul shortly after Mr. Khashoggi had been killed inside the Saudi Consulate.The impostor was easily recognizable in part because he wore different-colored shoes than Mr. Khashoggi was when he entered the consulate. A Saudi official as well as another Saudi briefed on the kingdom\u2019s investigation into the killing confirmed the ruse.The inclusion of a body double in the squad is the latest indication that the death of Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist last seen on Oct. 2, occurred during a premeditated plot by the Saudis to abduct or kill him and hide what they did.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has promised that on Tuesday he will reveal for the first time the truth \u201cin full nakedness,\u201d in the face of what his aides have called a Saudi cover-up. Turkish officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, have said they have recordings and other evidence showing that Mr. Khashoggi was murdered and then dismembered on orders from the highest levels of the Saudi royal court.On Saturday, Saudi Arabia\u2019s rulers admitted for the first time that their agents had killed Mr. Khashoggi. In their new version of events, they said he was accidentally strangled during a brawl that broke out in the consulate as the Saudi agents tried to persuade him to return to the kingdom.The Saudi officials have also said that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the 33-year-old de facto ruler of the kingdom, had no knowledge of the mission and that he learned of the killing only two weeks later.Asked why a team that had not intended to harm Mr. Khashoggi had employed a look-alike to try to fool security cameras, a Saudi official briefed on the matter said it had been a spur-of-the moment improvisation after the agents realized they had killed him.\u201cThey panicked after he died, and in order to make it appear he left the consulate, they decided to impersonate him,\u201d the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing.Turkish officials, however, noted that the look-alike\u2019s background also raised questions about why he was sent to Istanbul in the first place.Officials of the kingdom have acknowledged that a team of 15 Saudis flew into Istanbul on Oct. 2 for the Khashoggi mission, and Turkish officials have disclosed the names of 15 Saudis who were almost all young men with obvious ties to the security services.Other details and disputes continued to emerge. Even as they acknowledge that Mr. Khashoggi was killed, Saudi officials have insisted that they have no information about the location of his remains. They have said the agents handed the remains to a local accomplice whose identity remains undisclosed.On Monday, the official who discussed the body double added a new detail to the Saudi account of the body\u2019s disposal: The agents, the official said, rolled Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s body in a rug before handing it over.Turkish officials have said that audio recordings and other evidence show that the team moved to kill and dismember Mr. Khashoggi almost immediately after he entered the consulate, during an appointment to pick up a document. The Saudi team included a doctor who was perhaps the foremost expert on autopsies in the kingdom, and, according to Turkish officials, he brought a bone saw for use in disposing of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s remains.On Monday, a person close to Mr. Erdogan and briefed on the Turkish evidence added new specificity to the Turkish claims about the speed with which Mr. Khashoggi was killed, and said it also showed premeditation.Mr. Khashoggi came under attack within two minutes of entering the consulate, this person said, was dead within seven minutes, and was dismembered within 22 minutes. Turkish officials briefed on the investigation have previously said that the team had finished its work and left the consulate within less than two hours.Amid the escalating doubts about Saudi Arabia\u2019s new explanation for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, a growing number of current and former Western government officials with extensive experience in Saudi Arabia have now said publicly that they believe Crown Prince Mohammed must have ordered the killing.Mr. Erdogan has long publicly treated the crown prince as a respected ally to maintain good relations with Saudi Arabia, an important regional power. But it was an open secret that the two men were bitter rivals in a feud over Arab democracy and political Islam that has divided the region.Evidently sensing Saudi weakness after the skeptical reception that greeted the latest claims from the kingdom, Mr. Erdogan over the last two days has gone on the attack.Mr. Erdogan has promised to reveal a truth \u201cin full nakedness\u201d in a political speech on Tuesday. A political ally close to him said the Turkish president planned to ask pointed questions implicitly or indirectly blaming the royal court for the killing.But the same ally tamped down expectations, saying Mr. Erdogan does not intend to disclose the specific evidence other officials have cited. Some of that evidence may have been obtained through audio surveillance of the consulate in violation of international agreements. Mr. Erdogan is instead expected to postpone further revelations pending a report on the case by a Turkish prosecutor.But he remains determined to try to assign the blame for the killing to the upper reaches of the Saudi royal court, as close as possible to the crown prince, the ally said. Turkey also sees an added benefit to deferring full disclosure: It could prolong international attention to the mystery of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fate, compounding the damage to the prince\u2019s reputation.Mr. Erdogan, the person close to him said, recounted that a Saudi envoy, Prince Khaled bin Faisal, had offered a package of inducements for Turkey to drop the case \u2014 including financial aid and investments to help Turkey\u2019s struggling economy, and an end to a Saudi embargo on Qatar, a Turkish ally. Mr. Erdogan has told associates that he angrily rejected the offer as \u201ca political bribe,\u201d this person said.In the meantime the international backlash against Saudi Arabia has widened.Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s foreign policy chief, said the disclosures so far about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death a \u201cshocking violation\u201d of international conventions and norms of consular behavior.Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Hatice Cengiz, has been placed under police protection, a Turkish official said on Monday. The official said the measure had been taken not because of any specific threat, but because Ms. Cengiz, who was to marry Mr. Khashoggi the day after he went to the Saudi Consulate, had been the target of online abuse.Reporting was contributed by Malachy Browne, Christiaan Triebert, Matthew Rosenberg and Alissa J.

She pumped breast milk at work, and in an effort to be efficient, she also pumped hands-free while driving back home.\u201cI\u2019d wear one of those nursing covers, the kind that looks like an apron, over the pumping equipment, because I was totally paranoid that a passing car would be able to look in,\u201d Ms. Yura said. Pumping on the go also made post-work errands and stopping for gas difficult.Eventually, Ms. Yura found her current job, as director of community engagement and policy at the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, which offers a flexible schedule. She and her husband and daughter, who is now 2 and a half, moved so that she could be closer to work.Allison Robinson, chief executive and founder of the Mom Project, a Chicago-based digital marketplace that matches professional women with employment opportunities, says commuting distance and length are top-tier factors for job applicants.\u201cWhat may have once been a frustrating commute could now mean missing school drop-off or bath time. The stakes of losing those hours in the day may be higher,\u201d Ms. Robinson explains.What followed was a scramble familiar to many parents working outside the home: 7 a.m. day care drop offs, rushing to the train station before the parking fills up, determining which partner has to work late and which will leave early enough to make it back before the nanny\u2019s shift ends or the day care or after school program closes.\u201cA lot of people say \u2018I\u2019ll just work on my commute.

Ms. Rizzardi made partner, but eventually the stress, commuting and a slew of illnesses that kept her daughter home caught up. She left her job.Ms. Rizzardi, now a mother of two, pivoted. Real estate was one of her practice areas as an attorney and she decided to become a licensed real estate agent. She makes her own schedule with clients, many of them parents. And she is noticing the effect of long commutes on the housing market.\u201cBefore they were looking for guest rooms,\u201d Ms. Rizzardi says. \u201cNow it\u2019s \u2018forget the guest room, where can I have a home office so I\u2019m not in the living room with a laptop?\u2019 They\u2019re even converting sheds in the back yard to offices. They need to be somewhere where it\u2019s quiet.\u201dFollowing are some tips for commuting parents.To make the most of time on the road, many commuting parents swear by audiobooks and podcasts.Negotiate a flexible schedule with your boss, such as working remotely on certain days or shifting your hours, such as arriving earlier or later to outsmart traffic.Try the \u201csplit shift\u201d: logging in from home in the early hours or after the kids go to bed in lieu of spending the full day at the office, but disconnect from work during family time in between.Arrange to divvy up school drop-offs and pickups with your spouse.Cultivate a local support system, so a trusted friend or neighbor can get your child or organize a play date at a nearby park when you\u2019re running late \u2014 especially if parenting solo. Add their names to the \u201callowed to pick up\u201d list at school.Don\u2019t promise your child you will be there for her soccer game if there is even the slight possibility that your meeting will run long or you\u2019ll be stuck on the freeway.If your commute makes you so late that you have to miss bedtime, try saying good night via FaceTime \u2014 but pull over first if you\u2019re driving, of course.Enlist a grandparent or hire a part-time nanny or a mother\u2019s helper to assist with pickups, homework and after-school activities.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Europe Plans a Way to Evade Sanctions on Iran. Will It Work?", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe United States has long used its economic and financial power to pursue its foreign policy goals. Often, these interventions have interfered in the activities of foreign companies and, in some cases, frustrated the United States\u2019 closest allies.But last week the European Union announced a novel plan to evade Washington\u2019s reach.Federica Mogherini, the European Union\u2019s top diplomat, said the bloc was setting up a \u201cspecial payments entity\u201d that would work to shield non-American companies from the United States\u2019 economic actions against Iran. President Trump this year abandoned a nuclear deal with Iran, which included France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China, and his administration has been reimposing sanctions as it seeks to extract concessions from Tehran.Big questions loom over the European Union\u2019s plan to create a money-transfer system to help Iran. Among them: Can this entity help sustain a meaningful amount of trade with Iran? Can it be safeguarded from the United States\u2019 financial sleuths? Will it require significant use by two of America\u2019s biggest adversaries, China and Russia, to really work?The stakes are high for both sides.The Trump administration can be expected to fight any attempt to financially support Iran. The Treasury Department said in an emailed statement this week that the European effort was being monitored: \u201cWe will carefully review alternative measures being considered to circumvent our sanctions and are confident that we can prevent evasion.\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described the mechanism as \u201cdisastrous policy.\u201dBut the European Union is raring to show that Mr. Trump cannot undermine its most important foreign policy achievements. Defending the Iran accord is an opportunity to do just that. The European Union sees the new system as a way to sustain trade with Iran, in part, to help keep that country\u2019s frail economy from going into a tailspin.The mechanism is simple in purpose if not execution: Provide a way for companies to move money in and out of Iran when Western banks won\u2019t do that. It also faces plenty of skeptics.Some analysts said the European Union most likely did not expect the payment system to fully develop. Instead, they said, the mechanism is more a gesture by Europe to help persuade Iran to stick with the nuclear deal.But others said the United States ought not to underestimate the commitment of the Europeans, particularly that of Ms. Mogherini, who was involved in the 2015 negotiations that sought to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201cShe was the one who closed the nuclear deal on the European side,\u201d said Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThe payments vehicle is not just a political gesture. For her, it\u2019s much more personal.\u201dPerhaps the biggest challenge to the European effort is that large Western companies won\u2019t need the payment entity because they simply won\u2019t be doing any business with Iran. Scores of multinational companies pulled away from Iran after the United States withdrew from the nuclear deal and won\u2019t want to risk penalties.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to take the risk that Total could be torpedoed by President Trump,\u201d Patrick Pouyann\u00e9, chief executive of Total, a French oil company, said in an interview.Total had planned to invest in Iran but shelved those plans this year. For many large businesses, ancillary concerns \u2014 such as whether they can get insurance coverage for their shipments \u2014 played a role.\u201cFor us, it does not work, I am sure,\u201d Mr. Pouyann\u00e9 said when asked about the payments entity.And France added yet another twist in relations with Iran this week: It froze the assets of Iran\u2019s spy ministry after linking it to a foiled bomb plot planned for June. France maintains that it can punish Iran for hostile acts but still remain in the nuclear deal. The Trump administration has decided the United States cannot.The European Union faces a potentially huge obstacle: Banks may not want to have any connections with the payments entity.Banks doing business with it could be subject to American penalties. And if Western banks don\u2019t connect to the entity, European companies will have no way of getting money in and out of the payments mechanism.The European Union could try to use a government-owned institution, like its lending arm, the European Investment Bank, to process payments in and out of the entity. But that institution would most likely be vulnerable to United States sanctions as well.Even if the European Union could set up the system, it would have to convince companies that it was reliable \u2014 and so secure that the United States government could not penetrate it.Rivka Little, a research director specializing in payments at International Data Corporation, a consultancy, said setting up a payments company would be a huge undertaking. The European Union\u2019s entity may be easier to establish because of its narrower focus, but, she said, customers would still expect it to have all the necessary features, like messaging, clearing and settlement.And in an era when payments networks have been shown to be vulnerable to abuse, the European Union would have to monitor it for illegal activity.\u201cThere is one thing fraudsters like more than anything, and that\u2019s a new payment network,\u201d Ms. Little said.Despite all those challenges, the European Union\u2019s payments channel might attract enough participants to keep it going.The big question is whether large Chinese and Russian companies would use the entity for business that is targeted by the United States, like trade in oil and gas products.\u201cIt\u2019s a very important signal that Russia and China are in this,\u201d said Mr. Kirkegaard, the analyst.The European Union may, however, end up deciding that involving Chinese or Russian firms could do too much damage to its relations with the United States.But even if it excludes such companies, the bloc may yet find businesses eager for alternate money-transfer options. Some smaller European firms, for instance, may do types of business in Iran that are not targeted by American sanctions, such as exports of certain consumer goods, and would find the entity provides easier access.The danger for the United States is that the payments mechanism gives the European Union valuable experience operating outside Washington\u2019s financial sphere of influence and becomes a permanent part of the international payments system.The Treasury Department email this week showed the United States\u2019 concern, and the Trump administration may soon have to decide to respond. Erich Ferrari, a lawyer who specializes in United States sanctions law, said the Trump administration could impose sanctions directly on the entity or pressure private companies not to use it.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a showdown,\u201d Mr. Ferrari said. \u201cHow far does the U.S. want to push this?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Trump Bump in Stocks Is Weakening", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf the stock market keeps dropping, President Trump could lose one of his favorite bragging rights.Concerns about higher interest rates, Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies and slower economic growth outside the United States have weighed heavily on stocks this month. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 5 percent in October and sits 5.6 percent below its record high in September.Still the stock market remains up a lot since Election Day in 2016, something Mr. Trump has often trumpeted. And with the economy solid and unemployment low, the recent volatility in the stock market is unlikely to have much effect on the midterm elections next month.But the stock market is one of the most prominent indicators of confidence, and recent weakness suggests investors have some doubts about Mr. Trump\u2019s leadership. If the S. & P. 500 falls further, Mr. Trump will struggle to compare himself favorably with other presidents. Here\u2019s how he compares with his predecessors in the nearly two-year period after they were each elected.The S. & P. 500 is up 29.4 percent in the 710 days since Nov. 8, 2016. Over the same number of days after Barack Obama was re-elected in 2012, the benchmark posted a gain of 32.1 percent.The performance of stocks under Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama fall far short of the rally that took place after Bill Clinton was re-elected in 1996. The S. & P. 500 soared 48 percent over the equivalent period.It\u2019s fun to debate how much credit presidents deserve for strong stock market performance, but it\u2019s hard to know for sure. Investors take cues primarily from corporate earnings, forecasts of economic growth and whether stocks are expensive or cheap. Presidents typically have little direct influence over any of those. It\u2019s hard, for instance, to tie Mr. Clinton\u2019s policies to the innovation in the technology sector that helped stocks soar during his second term.With Mr. Trump, there is some clear causality. The tax cuts that he enacted last year have lifted corporate earnings, which helped push the S. & P. 500 higher.The rally since 2016 also stands out because it started when stocks were already quite highly valued. The price-to-earnings ratio of the S. & P. 500, which compares stock prices with the earnings of companies in the index, was 14 when Mr. Obama was re-elected. When Mr. Trump won, it was 18.But some of Mr. Trump\u2019s policies seem to have weighed on stocks and could continue to do so. His tax cuts that bolstered profits are causing the budget deficit to balloon, which is a growing source of concern among investors. The trade frictions that he has created have hurt the earnings of some companies. And if Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs on China weigh on that country\u2019s economy, the effects could be felt around the world.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and Women: Another Writer Looks for Answers", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhite House MemoWASHINGTON \u2014 Should Americans be shocked that President Trump called a woman \u201cHorseface\u201d this week?Not if they know anything about Mr. Trump\u2019s words and behavior over the past four decades, according to a growing subgenre of books that have chronicled in wincing detail the president\u2019s relationships with the women in his life.Does he like women?Ms. Burleigh pondered the question in an interview on Friday.\u201cOf course he likes some women,\u201d Ms. Burleigh said, \u201cand some women like him.\u201dIt\u2019s the ones who don\u2019t, she added, who see a different side of him.\u201cIt piques a certain primordial rage in him,\u201d Ms. Burleigh said.That seemed to be what happened this week when Mr. Trump revisited his habit of using disparaging and somewhat juvenile terms to strike out at women who have spoken out against him. He not only described Stephanie Clifford, the pornographic film star who goes by the name Stormy Daniels, as \u201cHorseface,\u201d but he also called Senator Elizabeth Warren by his nickname for her, \u201cPocahontas.\u201d Both have had less than flattering words to say about Mr. Trump.When asked by The Associated Press if his comments about Ms. Clifford were appropriate, he responded, \u201cTake it any way you want.\u201dUnlike other books detailing Mr. Trump\u2019s personal relationships, \u201cGolden Handcuffs\u201d lacks the explosive details of Mr. Wolff\u2019s \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d which resulted in a series of presidential Twitter explosions; the juicy Trump-children nuggets in Emily Jane Fox\u2019s \u201cBorn Trump\u201d; or the firsthand details relayed in Ivana Trump\u2019s memoir \u201cRaising Trump.\u201d\u201cI kicked Donald out of the room,\u201d the first Mrs. Trump wrote about giving birth, touching on her husband\u2019s reproductive squeamishness. \u201cLet him witness the birth? Never. My sex life would be finished after that.\u201dBut \u201cGolden Handcuffs\u201d still unearths stark details of the forces that shaped Mr. Trump\u2019s thinking about women \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s father, for example, forbade the word \u201cpregnant\u201d from being uttered in a household that would grow to five children, the book notes.It also underscores how different Mr. Trump\u2019s first marriage was compared with his second and third \u2014 each new Mrs. Trump, Ms. Burleigh writes, was more malleable and ultimately more amenable to his behavior than the last. As one of Melania Trump\u2019s childhood friends tells the author, \u201cIt\u2019s about all that power and protection.\u201dLike authors before her, Ms. Burleigh has sifted through decades of publicly available materials \u2014 including Mr. Trump\u2019s own words in memoirs and interviews \u2014 to animate the central point of the book: that Mr. Trump has long believed women, particularly if they are not able to be molded to his liking, are not to be trusted.\u201cWomen have one of the great acts of all time. The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers,\u201d Mr. Trump wrote shortly after his second divorce in \u201cTrump: The Art of the Comeback,\u201d one of several Trump memoirs highlighted in the book. \u201cThe person who came up with the expression \u2018the weaker sex\u2019 was either very na\u00efve or had to be kidding. I have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye \u2014 or perhaps another body part.\u201dWhen women don\u2019t exit his life without a fight, Ms. Burleigh notes, they are threatened with silence. The practice goes back decades: Plans for a memoir written by Marla Maples, Mr. Trump\u2019s second wife, were scuttled because \u201ca confidentiality clause Trump inserted into the divorce decree effectively sewed up Marla\u2019s lips for life.\u201dMs. Clifford\u2019s lawyer responded by calling the president \u201ca disgusting misogynist.\u201dThe White House did not respond to questions about Ms. Burleigh\u2019s book or the president\u2019s comments about women on Friday. In the past, the West Wing has disparaged similar books as publicity-seeking stunts.Next comes Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, the fisherman\u2019s daughter from a Scottish village whose past as a maid in the 64-room Carnegie Mansion Ms. Burleigh uncovered in census files at the New York Public Library. That brush with New York high society, Ms. Burleigh writes, engendered an outsider\u2019s love of ceremony and pomp inherited by Mrs. Trump\u2019s fourth child, the future president of the United States.Mr. Trump wrote in his 1987 memoir that he got his sense of showmanship from her. But he also grew up watching his father and grandmother scoff at his mother\u2019s obsession with social status.\u201cMary\u2019s airs were the antithesis of her mother-in-law Elisabeth Trump\u2019s \u2014 and Fred\u2019s \u2014 way of life,\u201d Ms. Burleigh wrote.\u201cGolden Handcuffs\u201d also touches on the living: Melania Trump, the enigmatic homebody, and Ivanka Trump, the eldest daughter and marketing juggernaut, are two central characters.A glimpse of those two on election night provided the inspiration for Ms. Burleigh\u2019s book. When she saw the president-elect flanked by \u201cfour or five gazelles all kind of looking alike\u201d \u2014 the daughters, the daughters-in-law and the third Mrs. Trump \u2014 Ms. Burleigh felt as though the women behind the man were ultimately more interesting.\u201c\u2018What does it mean to American women that these women are participating in the commodification and branding of the feminine?\u2019\u201d she said she asked herself. \u201cThe presence of these women around him made me understand there is a whole demographic of American women who think that this\u201d \u2014 meaning the beautiful women flanking a man who has attacked others \u2014 \u201cis pretty much O.K.\u201dAdvertisement"}

All was silent but for the humming of cicadas, all was still apart from the sultry breeze, and all was dark, except for the green flashing lights on the giant construction crane hovering overhead.Nevertheless, her influence is felt. \u201cIn French we would call her incontournable\u201d \u2014 essential \u2014 said Simon de Pury, the art auctioneer and collector. \u201cShe is one of the most committed people to art and to culture that I have ever come across. She\u2019s a rainmaker in the art world.\u201dSimon Castets, the director of the Swiss Institute, described her efforts, as chairwoman, to help the art organization find a new home on St. Marks Place, oversee its renovation, and lead a successful $5 million capital campaign as \u201ccentral\u201d and \u201ctireless.\u201dBut the most self-driven of all her projects is Luma Arles. \u201cThere came a moment 10 years ago when I made up my mind, and said I want to try to do production in Europe,\u201d she said in an interview in her apartment in New York in August. \u201cI wanted to put my activities into one place, to have more weight and meaning.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s enough,\u201d she said, seated at the head of a long polished wood table, wearing a regal red muumuu. \u201cTo be perpetually challenged is not interesting. The media, the people \u2014 it\u2019s a perpetual scrutiny.\u201d She added, \u201cThis is preventing me from moving ahead.\u201dMs. Hoffmann is trying to transform Arles through art, much in the same way that the artist Donald Judd reimagined a town called Marfa in Texas, or the Dia Art Foundation rebuilt the upstate New York town of Beacon, using art as a draw and an economic engine. In doing so, Ms. Hoffmann has taken on a role that was once reserved for public officials and city planners: imagining the future and then building it.\u201cTo my great sadness all the public authority people who were in charge at the time just sort of gave up because they were impressed that there was such generosity and they didn\u2019t know how to cope with it,\u201d Mr. Hebel said in a recent telephone interview. \u201cIt sort of crippled people.\u201dToday, Ms. Hoffmann has a working relationship with the Rencontres, which uses some of the Parc des Ateliers\u2019 space in the summer. Mayor Herv\u00e9 Schiavetti of Arles, unlike his predecessor, is a fan. \u201cAs the project is now close to completion, I am very impressed,\u201d Mr. Schiavetti said in an email. \u201cThe reality is exactly what I dreamed of. Arles has entered a new era of its long history, thanks to LUMA.\u201dWhen I visited, the complaints I heard from the townspeople were about the tower itself, which some felt didn\u2019t fit in to the Arlesian landscape; others said that it was only for the art elite, not the residents.Ms. Hoffmann waved away these objections. \u201cOf course some people will say it\u2019s not aesthetically what I like,\u201d she said. \u201cSome Paris people said, \u2018Why do you destroy our ville de plouc\u2019 which means \u2018town of peasants\u2019? I\u2019m challenging this way of thinking, that\u2019s for sure. But I\u2019m more from there than they will ever be. It\u2019s not like I want to put my tower in that town. I know the town. I want to produce opportunities for the people who are from there.\u201dMs. Hoffmann believes that Luma will help Arles become less of a seasonal economy that is dependent on summer tourism, thus helping local businesses. Arles now has an unemployment rate of about 13 percent, higher than the national average of 9 percent. Mr. Schiavetti attributes a slight drop here, from July 2017 to July 2018, \u201cto the number of jobs created by and around the Luma Foundation.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m first-generation,\u201d she said. \u201cI certainly did not try to do the same as my father, but I can of course find some parallels. You engage in the country where you live and you try to say what you think and what you believe in, and discuss it with people. You act along with your beliefs.\u201dLuma Arles is almost finished; its opening is scheduled for spring 2020. Still to be built is a 10-acre public park with a lake and 500 new trees: a symbol of rebirth, turning the parched earth into a verdant landscape. The last leg of this journey may prove to be the trickiest for Ms. Hoffmann, as she will certainly need to face more scrutiny.She\u2019d much rather focus on her work, though. \u201cWhat\u2019s important today is to continue to be creative,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I have answers, I\u2019m just trying.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next.

The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other.

In the intervening time, he came of age, worked as a contractor, had daughters and sons, built two churches with his own hands and led them, and saw his sons join the ministry and lead their own congregations in other Delta towns.His return to his spiritual birthplace was not a matter of if, but rather when \u2014 18 years ago this month.

{"Headline": "Shinzo Abe Says Japan Is China\u2019s \u2018Partner,\u2019 and No Longer Its Aid Donor", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 It has been eight years since China overtook Japan as the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Yet the Japanese government continued to provide China with development assistance usually reserved for poorer countries. Until now.The announcement \u2014 coupled with new cooperation agreements Mr. Abe signed on Friday with his Chinese counterpart, Li Keqiang \u2014 signaled a significant shift in a relationship that has been haunted by war and occupation and is still strained by territorial disputes and other issues, which, publicly at least, have receded into the background.The subtext to the budding d\u00e9tente was Mr. Trump, whose go-it-alone approach to foreign relations has pushed the two historic rivals closer together.As the American president has walked away from global trade pacts and tangled with traditional allies over tariffs, Japan and China have decided to set aside some of the tensions that have governed relations between them for years. Now they are cooperating more closely on trade issues and developing business partnerships that could help buffer against the instability that Mr. Trump has introduced to the region.\u201cFrom competition to cooperation, the Japan-China relationship is shifting to a new phase now,\u201d Mr. Abe said at an appearance with Mr. Li following a ceremonial welcome on Tiananmen Square that included a cannon salute and a review of troops under crisp blue skies.\u201cWe are neighbors; we\u2019re partners who will cooperate with each other, rather than be a threat to each other,\u201d Mr. Abe said.The Japanese leader, who had long sought an official visit to the Chinese capital, was accompanied by foreign and trade ministers and more than 1,000 businesspeople, who he said had come to discuss joint infrastructure and other projects in countries throughout the region.That signaled a greater focus on trade and investment, and a departure from the 40-year program of aiding Chinese development. Many saw that aid program, which began in 1978 in what both countries described as a new start to their relationship, as a form of atonement for Japan\u2019s brutal invasion of China in 1937, which set the stage for World War II.Japan has \u201cended its historical mission\u201d to assist China financially, Mr. Abe said at a reception after his arrival on Thursday night. \u201cNow, Japan and China are playing indispensable roles for economic growth not only in Asia but also in the whole world,\u201d he said.Mr. Li said on Friday that relations were \u201cback to their normal trajectory.\u201dBut Mr. Abe signaled a willingness to support new joint projects as long as China conducts them within international standards of transparency, environmental protection and economic viability, a spokesman later said.In a significant sign of closer economic cooperation, the two countries\u2019 central banks also agreed to swap 200 billion renminbi, or 3.2 trillion yen \u2014 the equivalent of $29 billion \u2014 for use in financial emergencies. Other agreements covered protection of intellectual property and the environment.\u201cWithout stability in the East China Sea, there can be no true improvement in the relationship,\u201d he said, paraphrasing Mr. Abe.Mr. Abe has visited China four times, meeting Mr. Xi on the sidelines of various international gatherings, but this was the first invitation extended for an official bilateral meeting. Mr. Osuga deflected a question about the role Mr. Trump\u2019s policies played in nudging the two countries into closer cooperation.In the nearly 40 years since Japan began funneling foreign aid to China, it has provided 3.65 trillion yen to support infrastructure, humanitarian projects and environmental protection.Analysts in both countries said the decision to end the aid made sense in today\u2019s context.\u201cUp to now, the relationship between Japan and China was that Japan was the modernized, developed country leading China in its modernization,\u201d said Akio Takahara, a professor at Tokyo University who specializes in Chinese politics.China has traditionally been reluctant to acknowledge the scale of Japan\u2019s assistance, except to imply that Japan offered it out of a sense of responsibility following the bloodiness of World War II.Yu Tiejun, vice president of the Institute of International and Strategic Studies at Peking University and a visiting scholar at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that many Chinese knew little about the aid \u2014 \u201cChina hasn\u2019t been telling much about the Japanese aid to its people,\u201d he said \u2014 but that it was considered to have had a positive impact over the years.Even so, he added, \u201cChina should have graduated a long time before.\u201d\u201cJapan played a large part in that, but Japan has been given very little credit for it,\u201d she said.Japan never officially declared that the aid, most of which came in the form of loans that were discontinued 10 years ago, represented any kind of war reparations. But analysts in Japan say that did play a role, at least at the start of the program, and that many people saw it that way.\u201cThe Japanese politicians who began the overseas development assistance in the first place had that in mind,\u201d Mr. Takahara said. He added that given political sensibilities in Japan about formal war apologies, it was difficult for any official to declare openly that the aid was anything other than economic assistance for a developing neighbor.Some historians dispute the idea that the aid represented a form of atonement.Japan \u201cprovided a lot of money to help China with the environment,\u201d Ms. Lind said. \u201cBut it\u2019s because Japan worried about the weather blowing pollution from China toward Japan. So they had a big incentive to help China figure out how to clean up its air.\u201dIn 2007, Japan ended its yen loan program, which represented about three-quarters of its aid to China. What remained were small-scale grants made to local communities for individual projects.Now, Japan is proposing that it cooperate with China on such projects in Southeast Asia. The advantage for Japan is that it can move away from direct competition with China on such projects and toward a program of cooperation that lets Japan dictate some of the environmental and labor standards.Luz Ding contributed research from Beijing.Advertisement"}

They aren\u2019t seriously trying to engage with the reality of climate change or the economics of reduced emissions; their goal is to keep polluters free to pollute as long as possible, and they\u2019ll grab onto anything serving that goal.Still, it\u2019s worth pointing out how thoroughly all their arguments have collapsed in recent years.Think about that. Decades ago experts predicted, based on fundamental science, that emissions would raise global temperatures. People like Trump scoffed. Now the experts\u2019 prediction has come true. And the deniers insist that emissions aren\u2019t the culprit, that something else must be driving the change, and it\u2019s all a conspiracy. Come on.In short, while the arguments of climate deniers were always weak, they\u2019ve gotten much weaker. Even if you were genuinely persuaded by the deniers five or 10 years ago, subsequent developments should have made you reconsider.In reality, of course, climate denial has never had much to do with either logic or evidence; as I said, deniers are clearly arguing in bad faith. They don\u2019t really believe what they\u2019re saying. They\u2019re just looking for excuses that will let people like the Koch brothers keep making money. Besides, liberals want to limit emissions, and modern conservatism is largely about owning the libs.One way to think about what\u2019s happening here is that it\u2019s the ultimate example of Trumpian corruption. We have good reason to believe that Trump and his associates are selling out America for the sake of personal gain. When it comes to climate, however, they aren\u2019t just selling out America; they\u2019re selling out the whole world.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Surprising Truths About Trade Deficits", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEconomic ViewMr. Trump\u2019s confusion is understandable. Economists have spent centuries studying trade, debunking common myths and arriving at some surprising truths.Let\u2019s review, both for the president and ourselves, some conclusions about trade that most economists accept but, upon first hearing, are not at all obvious.To understand what\u2019s wrong with that inference, consider some of the many bilateral trade deficits that I run. Whenever my family goes out to dinner, the restaurateur gets some money, and we get a meal. In economics parlance, the Mankiw family runs a trade deficit with that restaurant. But that doesn\u2019t make us losers. After all, we leave with full stomachs.To be sure, I would be happy to have balanced trade. I would be delighted if every time my family went out to dinner, the restaurateur bought one of my books. But it would be harebrained for me to expect that or to boycott restaurants that had no interest in adding to their collection of economics textbooks.I can run persistent trade deficits with restaurants because I run trade surpluses elsewhere. Take The New York Times, for instance. It pays me more for my columns than I pay it for my subscription. That\u2019s a bilateral trade surplus for me and a bilateral trade deficit for The Times. But nonetheless, we both gain from the relationship.To see the folly in that conclusion, consider again the Mankiw family. Our overall trade balance is the sum of all our bilateral trade balances with everyone else \u2014 restaurants, The Times, and so on. The end result equals the difference between our income and our spending.If our overall trade balance is positive, we are spending less than we are earning, meaning we are saving. If our overall trade balance is negative, we are spending more than we are earning. In the language of economists, we are dissaving.Whether a trade deficit represents a problem depends on whether our spending is prudent or profligate. When a family takes out a loan to buy a car, it runs a trade deficit, but that need not be a reason for concern, as long as it can afford the car in the long run.On the other hand, if a family runs a trade deficit by persistently living beyond its means, that\u2019s a problem because debts eventually come due. But in this case, the trouble comes not from disreputable trading partners but from poor financial planning. If you eat at expensive restaurants too often, blame yourself, not the restaurateur.Similar reasoning applies to countries. Nations run trade deficits when their spending on consumption and investment, both private and public, exceeds the value of goods and services they produce. If you really want to reduce a trade deficit, the way to do it is to bring down spending relative to production, not to demonize trading partners around the world.Mr. Trump thinks the trade deficit makes us losers in international trade, so he wants to shrink it. But many of his initiatives actually push in the opposite direction.The tax cuts, for example, tend to increase private spending, by both households on consumption goods and businesses on investment goods. Reduced business regulation should also stimulate investment spending. Because the trade deficit represents an excess of spending over production, this increased spending results in a larger trade deficit.Movements in the exchange rate help explain the link between spending and the trade deficit. As spending in the United States increases, the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates to keep inflation in check. Higher interest rates attract capital inflows from abroad, causing the dollar to appreciate. A stronger dollar makes our exports more expensive and our imports cheaper.All this isn\u2019t to say that the president\u2019s policies are necessarily misguided. The tax bill should be interpreted on its own merits \u2014 whether it makes the tax system fairer and more efficient and whether it brings in enough revenue to finance the government. And each regulatory change should be evaluated based on its costs and benefits.What these policies do to the trade deficit is, at most, a secondary concern. In many ways, the trade deficit is a fake problem. Our elected leaders should look elsewhere to gauge the success of their policies.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Democrats Lost Rural America. This Former Rodeo Star Thinks He Can Win It Back.", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBROOKINGS, S.D. \u2014 First came the Republicans, all smiles and matching blue T-shirts as they marched in this college town\u2019s annual Hobo Day homecoming parade. Then the tractor team rolled past, and the dairy club, and the Corn Palace Shriners.Finally, at the end of the line: the Democrats. Behind as usual.Farmers and ranchers from this rural state once sent liberal icons like George McGovern to Congress, but these days, Democrats have all but vanished into the plains, a stark example of how far the party has tumbled in rural America. They hold no statewide elected offices in South Dakota. They make up less than 20 percent of the State Legislature. Their numbers are shrinking so fast that they rank below registered independents in a dozen counties.But on a sunny Saturday, shaking hands and nudging his wheelchair up the parade route, came Billie Sutton, a 34-year-old state senator and onetime rodeo rider who is making a surprisingly competitive run for governor against South Dakota\u2019s four-term Republican congresswoman, Kristi Noem.Mr. Sutton is running as an anti-abortion conservative Democrat with cowboy cred and a stirring life story. His supporters think he can show Democrats how to start rebuilding the party in socially conservative states where the ag-heavy economy rises and falls with rain cycles and soybean prices.At 23, Mr. Sutton was one of the world\u2019s top saddle bronco riders when the horse he\u2019d drawn in a circuit event in North Dakota reared up and smashed him into the chute in October 2007. He still remembers the horse\u2019s name: Ruby. In an instant, Mr. Sutton was paralyzed from the waist down and his rodeo career was over.\u201cHe\u2019s a South Dakota boy,\u201d said Tara Vanderwal, who slapped on a blue Sutton sticker at the parade.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t act like a politician,\u201d said her husband, Phil, a Republican who said he is leaning toward Mr. Sutton.But to have any shot in this conservative-dominated state, Mr. Sutton will need to persuade thousands more Phil Vanderwals.Democrats in South Dakota have not won a governor\u2019s race in 44 years. They have 95,000 fewer registered voters than Republicans \u2014 a huge and widening gap in a state of just 870,000 people. And Ms. Noem has a powerful supporter campaigning for her: President Trump, who won South Dakota by 30 points in 2016, and raised more than $518,000 for her at an event last month.One afternoon, on the Sutton family\u2019s ranch overlooking the Missouri River, the candidate\u2019s father, Bill, summed up his son\u2019s problem: \u201cHe\u2019s going to need a lot of Trump supporters to win.\u201dIn campaign ads shot on the family ranch, Mr. Sutton tells and tells the story of how his rodeo injury propelled him toward public service. He gives speeches denouncing corruption scandals and secrecy in the Republican-led state government, and pledges to give a voice to struggling farmers and ranchers.To South Dakota\u2019s handful of liberals, it sometimes feels like he is running as an anti-Democrat. He is pro-gun, anti-abortion and says he opposes a state income tax. He has a Republican running mate. He deflects when asked about social issues that divide Democrats from most South Dakotans, like whether he would have voted to confirm Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.\u201cThe national party hasn\u2019t been engaged with a good message,\u201d Mr. Sutton said. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been relating to people in the Midwest. It used to be fighting for the little guy.\u201dIn a normal year, this would all be fodder for a Nice Try campaign that ended with a 20-point loss. But Democrats here are starved for a win, and a bitter Republican primary has left some conservatives angry with Ms. Noem\u2019s campaign. A handful of Republicans who supported the South Dakota attorney general, Marty Jackley, in the Republican primary have now publicly signed on with Mr. Sutton.The Cook Political Report recently declared the race a \u201ctoss-up\u201d \u2014 rather than a Republican layup. Assessing the true state of the race in a thinly populated rural state like South Dakota is difficult. Partisan surveys from Democrats have showed a tight race, but there have not been any independent public polls of the race so far.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.\u201cAfter four decades there\u2019s this perception that a Democrat just can\u2019t win,\u201d said Tom Daschle, the former Senate majority leader from South Dakota who lost his seat in 2004. \u201cThis year that\u2019s changing.\u201dNot yet. Ms. Noem, 46, a rancher and farmer herself, is a tough opponent also running a history-setting campaign. She would become South Dakota\u2019s first female governor, and her supporters say her own life story is proof of her grit and goodness.Twenty years ago, she interrupted her college education to take over the family ranch after her father was killed in a farming accident. She finished up her bachelor\u2019s years later, in 2012, as a freshman member of Congress.With Congress now in recess, Ms. Noem is crisscrossing the state. She is steeped in South Dakota policy, and spent one campaign day with voters diving into the weeds of nursing-home payments, hunting regulations, water-use policy and even property-tax rates in Brown County. At every stop, she dinged Mr. Sutton as a lightweight and a liberal in cowboy clothes.At a supermarket cafe in Aberdeen where she discussed education with about 80 supporters, Ms. Noem pointed out that she had 14 detailed governing plans on her website.\u201cI think he\u2019s got like five,\u201d she said of Mr. Sutton.Many of the people she met over caramel rolls had deep-red gripes about the country: Democrats had disgraced the country during the Kavanaugh nomination. People on government assistance should be drug-tested. Environmental regulations and taxes were strangling farmers and businesses.As Ms. Noem nodded and answered their questions, she pitched herself as an experienced chief executive who was just as South Dakotan as Mr. Sutton. When a voter asked her why they should elect yet another Republican governor, Ms. Noem said she saw her character was forged by working a ranch, running small businesses and teaching Sunday school, not simply being a Republican.\u201cBut,\u201d she added, \u201cyou should also remember that Billie Sutton is a Democrat.\u201dRobert and Travis Swisher, father-and-son farmers, agreed with that as they listened to Ms. Noem at a Dairy Queen in Groton. Yes, Mr. Sutton seemed like a decent guy, they said. But they could not imagine voting for any Democrat, no matter his background or policies.\u201cThere are no more Democrats like when Dad was growing up,\u201d Travis, the son, said. Ms. Noem\u2019s campaign is aiming to capitalize on that sentiment by linking Mr. Sutton to Hillary Clinton.But some conservatives said they were giving Mr. Sutton a close look. They said that Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies were hurting their farms, and that Republican policies had done little to bring down their health care costs.Hope Block, a finance officer in Groton, S.D., said she would support expanding Medicaid \u2014 a position favored by Mr. Sutton and opposed by Ms. Noem. Wayne Wasilk said his 100-cow dairy farm was struggling, and he liked what he had heard from Mr. Sutton.\u201cNobody has the farmers\u2019 and ranchers\u2019 back right now,\u201d Mr. Sutton said.As much as farmers are worried, the rest of the state\u2019s economy is humming. Overall unemployment is 3 percent, and there might not be enough discontent for voters to break with the Republican Party.Four years ago, Rick Weiland, a Sioux Falls businessman, ran a populist campaign to unseat South Dakota\u2019s junior Republican senator, Mike Rounds. He thinks Mr. Sutton\u2019s anti-corruption message will resonate.But when he was campaigning in 2014, he said he would pull into some tiny town cafe, bent on winning over voters who may have been overlooked by candidates before. Mr. Weiland said they would thank him for visiting, and ask his party. When he told them he was a Democrat, they would tell him they just couldn\u2019t vote for someone in his party.\u201cThey\u2019d roll their eyes like, \u2018Oh that\u2019s too bad,\u201d he said, \u201cand walk away.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Britain, France and Germany have promised to continue doing business with Tehran.The problems have piled up as European diplomats and oil analysts say that even after the sanctions go into effect, Iran will most likely sell at least one million barrels of crude oil a day \u2014 a sharp decline from last year but perhaps enough to sustain its economy and wait out Mr. Trump\u2019s term.The administration\u2019s stated goal for its sanctions campaign is for Iran to make a dozen fundamental changes to its domestic and foreign policies, including ending its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza and the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Few analysts believe the present Iranian government could fulfill the demands and survive.\u201cThere is no way the Trump administration will be able to achieve its 12 stated objectives because they\u2019re utterly unrealistic,\u201d said Robert Einhorn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cUnless significant changes are made, it\u2019s a policy destined to fail.\u201dBut efforts to tighten the screws on Tehran in the coming months could further alienate European allies, freight the relationship with China with yet another difficult dispute, undermine decades of efforts to woo India, and impede the stabilization of Syria and the battle against the Islamic State.Administration officials dismiss these risks in part because earlier warnings by critics about the downsides of leaving the Iran nuclear deal largely proved false.At the heart of Iran\u2019s financial future are its oil and gas exports, and Trump administration officials have adamantly said for months that they intend to reduce those exports to zero and penalize any country that continues purchases after Nov. 4 \u2014 which would effectively destroy Iran\u2019s economy. On Tuesday, a State Department spokesman retreated from those implacable demands.\u201cOur goal remains to get to zero oil purchases from Iran as quickly as possible. That\u2019s not changed,\u201d the spokesman, Robert Palladino, said during a press briefing, adding, \u201cBut we are prepared to work with countries that are reducing their imports on a case-by-case basis.\u201dThe Nov. 5 sanctions target Iran\u2019s central bank, oil sales and shipping companies, and come on top of a set of sanctions that went into effect in August. Administration threats have already persuaded buyers in Europe, Japan and South Korea to largely stop purchasing from Iran.As a result, Iran\u2019s crude oil exports loaded on tankers plunged by more than 20 percent to 1.8 million barrels per day in September, down from 2.3 million in May. Oil exports continued to decline in October, according to IHS Markit, an energy analytical firm.Some are predicting that the administration will announce penalties against some Chinese entities on Nov. 5 to show toughness against Beijing, popular with Mr. Trump\u2019s voters, ahead of the midterm elections the next day. But such sanctions will most likely be largely symbolic. Tariffs against China have already spooked Wall Street and lowered global growth projections. Broad sanctions could set off a panic.In India, the second-largest buyer of Iranian oil, private companies like the energy giant Reliance have largely stopped buying it. Government entities ramped up purchases over the summer so they could show reductions next year, analysts said. But significant purchases will most likely continue.Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s re-election campaign, scheduled for next spring, will prevent him from acceding to American demands on Iran, said Mohan Guruswamy, a distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in India.\u201cModi can\u2019t be seen as buckling on Iran since public sentiment is not with the U.S. on these new sanctions,\u201d Mr. Guruswamy said.Heather Nauert, the State Department\u2019s spokeswoman, recently called India\u2019s continuing purchases of Iranian oil \u201cnot helpful\u201d and said that \u201cIndia will find out\u201d if sanctions result.But sanctions against India would do violence to a host of American priorities, including efforts to bolster Afghanistan; counter China and Pakistan; and ramp up sales of American oil, natural gas and military equipment.Sanctions have caused pain, but they have yet to produce clear strategic victories for the Trump administration. Despite sanctions on North Korea, Russia and Venezuela, Pyongyang has so far shown no signs of slowing its nuclear and ballistic missile weapons production, President Vladimir V. Putin has only grown bolder and Venezuela continues to slide into anarchy.But administration officials will take a victory lap on Nov. 5. They are mindful that when Mr. Trump announced in May that he was walking away from the Iran nuclear deal, critics predicted that Tehran would soon restart its nuclear program, that oil prices would soar, and that sanctions would never truly bite without the support of others in the deal.None of those warnings proved true, giving administration officials a great sense of confidence in their policy.Advertisement"}

Pro-Brexit politicians in Britain saw it as an attempt to bind the country to the bloc indefinitely.Photos emerging from the talks in Brussels hinted at Britain\u2019s increasing isolation in the talks.

Leaning independents have both the preferences and the interest to be reliable party supporters, but they are repulsed from doing so by the very idea of government as a battleground.The independent as a disaffected partisan poses a challenge for parties. If leaning independents are former partisans who have become dissatisfied with politics, then winning their votes means appealing to partisan interests without engaging in an endless partisan war. Rallying strong partisan supporters may seem like a safe strategy for the 2018 midterms, but it may be shortsighted: The types of messages that are likely to please strong partisans may push more people into \u201cleaning,\u201d diminishing the number of voters who will reliably take actions \u2014 like vote \u2014 in support of the party in the future.When asked about the midterm elections, independents reported feeling worried, frustrated and indifferent.Leaning independents are people who could be \u2014 and likely once were \u2014 a reliable set of voters for their preferred political party, except they have been pushed away by partisan vitriol. Media coverage of political disagreement discourages these people from wearing campaign stickers, from discussing candidates with friends and co-workers, and even from socializing with the partisans they agree with. When we asked a large sample of voters how to make the worst impression upon meeting someone new, the consensus was that identifying as a strong partisan would do the trick.This election-year survey measures whether people consider themselves to be partisans or independents.

Relying on conflict to mobilize, however, is likely to leave parties with an increasingly shrinking pool of reliable voters.This business-as-usual approach might rally the extremes, but it will likely alienate independents from their parties.In turn, their retreat from partisanship leaves the political arena increasingly in the hands of the polarized.

{"Headline": "Khashoggi Case Raises Tensions Between Saudi Prince and Turkish President", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANKARA, Turkey \u2014 President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has long cast himself as a champion of the Arab Spring uprisings and the political Islamists who once seemed poised to ride them to power.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia anchors the opposite camp in an ideological battle raging across the Middle East: the anti-Islamist strongmen who quashed the revolts.Mr. Erdogan has repeatedly challenged Saudi Arabia to explain Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, while Turkish officials say they have video and audio evidence proving he was killed, and have unleashed a stream of leaks suggesting that the royal court ordered it. The crown prince and his spokesmen have insisted, without providing evidence, that Mr. Khashoggi left the consulate freely, professing that they, too, are worried about him.Turkish investigators are looking into the case of Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and vanished.The dispute pits two staunch, headstrong nationalists against each other \u2014 both with ambitions to reshape their region. They also share an aversion to public criticism and a history of refusing to back down from a fight.\u201cThese are two people who each think he is the most important person in the Muslim world,\u201d said Steven A. Cook, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations who studies both countries. \u201cEgo is a factor on both sides.\u201dOn Thursday, there were signs that the two leaders were looking for a way out. Mr. Erdogan\u2019s office announced that he had agreed to a Saudi request to form a joint \u201cworking group\u201d that will examine Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.Certainly, each man has much to lose.Mr. Erdogan is struggling to manage a teetering economy and his entanglement in war-torn Syria. He can ill afford a new battle with a deep-pocketed regional power like Saudi Arabia.For Prince Mohammed, the affair threatens to severely damage the image of moderate reformer that he has worked for years to cultivate. Eager to diversify the Saudi economy before it runs out of oil, he has courted Washington, Wall Street, Silicon Valley and Hollywood with promises to open up and modernize the kingdom.Internationally, it is already undermining his courtship of Western visitors and investors. Several participants said Thursday that they were dropping out of an investment conference known as Davos in the Desert that the prince is hosting this month in Riyadh.\u201cHis credibility in the West and in the U.S. is at stake,\u201d said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a fellow at the Baker Institute for Public Policy at Rice University. \u201cThe credibility gap is going to be huge, and the Saudi boosters in D.C. are going to find it extremely difficult to portray the image that they were generally quite successful in trying to push.\u201dWith lawmakers from both parties in Washington now threatening to seek sanctions over the case, Saudi leaders appear surprised by the magnitude of the international reaction. Prince Mohammed has canceled or postponed meetings with diplomats and other foreign visitors, and Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir has been unusually quiet.Mr. Erdogan, for his part, has almost taunted the crown prince with questions, testing how close he can come to blaming Saudi Arabia for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance without explicitly doing so.\u201cIs it possible that there is no camera system at a consulate, an embassy?\u201d he said, according to Turkish news reports. \u201cIs it possible there was no camera system in the Saudi Arabian Consulate where this incident happened? I mean, if a bird flies from here, a mosquito flies, those systems would capture it. And they have the most advanced ones.\u201d\u201cIt is not possible for us to remain silent about such an incident happening in our country,\u201d Mr. Erdogan said.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s greatest concern is not foreign but domestic: borrowing taken on during his 15-year drive to build up the Turkish economy has left its corporate sector sagging under the weight of more than $200 billion in foreign debt. That has dragged down the value of Turkish currency, spurring high inflation.Although Saudi Arabia is hardly its biggest investor, Turkish officials have boasted that their country did $8 billion a year in business with the kingdom. Wealthy Saudi holidaymakers are a staple of Istanbul\u2019s tourist industry.\u201cThe stakes are very high, and that is why Erdogan will be very restrained,\u201d said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the Ankara office director of the German Marshall Fund of the United States. \u201cTurkey is going through hard economic times, and Saudi Arabia and the Gulf countries have the ability to tip the balance of Turkey\u2019s economy.\u201dThe disappearance of Mr. Khashoggi also threatens something less tangible: the prestige Mr. Erdogan\u2019s Turkey has enjoyed around the region as a refuge for Arab politicians and thinkers under pressure from their own governments.\u201cBecause Turkey has become such a haven for Arabs who no longer feel safe in their own countries, there is a lot of reputational damage for Erdogan,\u201d said Tamara Cofman Wittes, a scholar at the Brookings Institution and a former State Department official.Several analysts said they already saw hints that Mr. Erdogan might be exploring a face-saving retreat for both sides \u2014 for example, by allowing the crown prince to acknowledge Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death but pin the blame on some rogue element in his government.The announcement of the joint working group in the case added to the speculation. But how that cooperation might work, given the Turkish allegations against the Saudis, remains to be seen.Over the years, Mr. Erdogan and Prince Mohammed have worked to suppress their differences.When the Turkish leader cracked down after a failed military coup two years ago, Saudi Arabia was quick to help him, extraditing a Turkish military attach\u00e9 suspected of playing a role in the plot. Mr. Erdogan singled out the kingdom for special thanks, and Prince Mohammed reciprocated by joining his father, King Salman, in congratulating Mr. Erdogan on his survival.When Egyptian newspapers recently quoted Prince Mohammed calling Turkey part of an \u201cevil\u201d alliance in the region, he hastened to deny it, issuing a statement that he was criticizing the Islamists of the Muslim Brotherhood, not the government of Turkey.But tensions between them still rose.Mr. Erdogan remains close to the Muslim Brotherhood, which Saudi Arabia considers a national security threat and has branded as a terrorist organization. Turkey has also remained close to Qatar, another regional friend to the Brotherhood.As he has consolidated power, Prince Mohammed has become increasingly bold. At age 33, he has charmed younger Saudis and many in the West by promising to diversify the Saudi economy and weaken the kingdom\u2019s religious authorities. He has let women drive and allowed concerts and movie theaters \u2014 all novelties for the kingdom.On a tour of the United States this year, Prince Mohammed was welcomed as a statesman. He met with President Trump; dined with Rupert Murdoch; had his picture taken with Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Bill Gates, and Tim Cook of Apple; and hung out with the actor known as The Rock.But many of his actions have backfired.His military intervention in Yemen has so far produced only a stalemate and humanitarian crisis. His detention of the prime minister of Lebanon was ultimately ineffectual. And his imprisonment without due process of hundreds of wealthy businessmen, including several of his royal cousins, unnerved many of the investors he had set out to woo.And now there are the allegations about Mr. Khashoggi.Ms. Wittes, the Brookings scholar, said that if the Saudis \u201care willing to assassinate a journalist on foreign soil because he was mildly critical, these international partners are going to be much less likely to send their students, researchers and experts to the kingdom or to set up long-term partnerships with the kingdom.\u201dBeing seen in the eyes of the world as responsible for such a grisly assassination might once have been enough to disqualify a crown prince from succession to the Saudi throne. But Prince Mohammed, who is known as MBS, appears to have amassed more control than any leader in decades over the sources of hard power in the kingdom \u2014 the military, the national guard and the Interior Ministry \u2014 as well as the oil ministry.Many analysts say there is almost no one left to challenge him \u2014 provided he maintains the good will of his elderly father.\u201cThere is no real coalition that can mobilize against MBS,\u201d said Mr. Ulrichsen, the Middle East fellow. \u201cHe seems to be secure in his position. And that seems to be the reason we see such actions.\u201dDavid D. Kirkpatrick reported from Ankara, and Ben Hubbard from Beirut. Carlotta Gall contributed reporting from Istanbul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Has the Stock Market Been Dropping? The Expansion Heads Toward a New Phase", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIt\u2019s a less bullish time for investors, but mostly good for workers and the economy. The bull market that will turn 10 years old early next year has, for most of its run, been a total dream for stock investors.Economic growth in the United States has been steady, but growth worldwide has been slow \u2014 which has kept interest rates low, making stocks a more compelling investment than cash or bonds in comparison.Late in this bull market, the Trump administration made its signature domestic policy initiative a steep cut in corporate tax rates, which flows through directly into higher after-tax profits for shareholders.Those three factors together were enough to propel the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 up more than 300 percent from its March 2009 low to its recent high in September. But now, all three are shifting.The economy is now heating up enough that interest rates are rising to more normal levels. Part of that is a result of Federal Reserve rate increases aimed at preventing the economy from overheating and from having excess inflation break out, a policy that President Trump has attacked.But it\u2019s not just the Fed. Even longer-term interest rates that the Fed does not directly control have risen substantially in the last year, as have longer-term rates in other countries. British, German and Japanese bond yields are all up over the same span.If you look at the stock market only in terms of its valuation \u2014 how much you have to spend to buy shares for each dollar of corporate earnings you are capturing \u2014 the stock market drop in recent weeks can be explained in significant part by the rise in longer-term rates in the same period.If you look at the price-earnings ratio of the S.&P. 500 stocks, for example, and invert it to view it as the earnings-to-price ratio, it was 4.77 percent on Sept 1, meaning buying $100 bought you $4.77 worth of corporate profits. After the stock drop, that had risen to 5.23 percent.Higher interest rates have made bonds more attractive, and it makes perfect sense that investors would demand a more favorable valuation from stocks given that alternative.The story might be different if investors believed that higher growth would feed disproportionately into higher corporate profits. But the current economic moment offers plenty of reason to think it won\u2019t.Earlier in the expansion, there might have been lots of workers on the sidelines, and companies had leverage with their suppliers. But there are signs that is changing, like recent comments by 3M and Caterpillar that their input costs were rising, which helped kick off the recent bout of market weakness.This is bad news for stocks and for the bottom lines of the largest companies, but good news for American workers. When you hear a phrase on a corporate call like \u201cinput costs are rising,\u201d keep in mind that the wages you receive are one of those costs.So far, the scale of the tariffs hasn\u2019t been big enough to have much impact on overall economic growth. But there has been a direct bottom-line impact for particular blue-chip companies that make goods using steel or aluminum (prices of which have spiked because of tariffs) or that import key parts from China.As companies try to reroute supply chains or absorb higher costs to avoid raising prices on consumers, the trade war may have a much larger effect on the bottom lines of major industrial companies, and hence on their stock prices, than it does for ordinary consumers.Put it together, and the stock market tumble of the last few weeks is not a mystery to be solved, nor a warning of horrible things to come, so much as an inevitable result of the economic expansion reaching a more mature stage.The stock market looks forward, not back \u2014 share prices are determined by what investors think the future looks like. And the economic future is starting to look quite different from the past.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Treasury Opts Against Labeling China a Currency Manipulator", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration is eagerly embracing a trade war with China, but on Wednesday, it opted once again not to label that nation a currency manipulator despite President Trump\u2019s repeated complaint that Beijing is weakening the renminbi.The Treasury Department\u2019s biannual currency exchange report, the fourth of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency, criticized China\u2019s trade and currency practices but still did not conclude that the Chinese government was improperly devaluing the renminbi. Doing so would have significantly ratcheted up tension between the United States and China; however, its status remained unchanged largely for technical reasons.The Treasury Department determined that China\u2019s direct intervention to reduce the value of its currency had been \u201climited,\u201d but it said Beijing\u2019s practices deserved scrutiny.\u201cOf particular concern are China\u2019s lack of currency transparency and recent weakness in the currency,\u201d Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a statement. \u201cThese pose major challenges to achieving fairer and more balanced trade, and we will continue to monitor and review China\u2019s currency practices, including ongoing discussions with the People\u2019s Bank of China.\u201dAlong with China, the Treasury Department said that Germany, India, Japan, Korea and Switzerland would remain on its \u201cmonitoring list\u201d for potential manipulation.The Treasury Department determines whether a country should be labeled a currency manipulator based on bilateral trade deficits and signs that a country is depressing its currency. The United States has not officially designated another country a manipulator since it assigned that label to China in 1994. Doing so is supposed to prompt negotiations to resolve the problem.The report comes as the United States and China have been locked in stalled trade discussions for months with little sign of an imminent breakthrough.Ahead of a cabinet meeting at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that China was not ready to make a deal.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve had it so good for so long.\u201dAdministration officials have been watching the movements of China\u2019s currency this year and expressed growing concern as its value against the dollar has declined about 6 percent since January. A weaker renminbi mitigates the impact of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs by making Chinese exports cheaper.The Treasury report notes that, through June of this year, China had a $390 billion goods trade surplus with the United States, making it the largest such gap of any major trading partner.\u201cI think China is manipulating their currency, absolutely,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cAnd I think the euro is being manipulated also.\u201dAs a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump called China the \u201cgreatest currency manipulators ever\u201d and promised to take action if elected.Last week, Mr. Mnuchin said that he discussed the renminbi\u2019s recent weakness with Yi Gan, the governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, during the annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Indonesia.\u201cI expressed my concerns about the weakness in the currency and we also talked about what would be a pathway to getting a more balanced trading relationship,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said.Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China are expected to meet in Argentina next month at the Group of 20 summit meeting. The prospect of a face-to-face meeting between the two leaders has raised hopes that there could be a breakthrough in the trade dispute.But some members of Mr. Trump\u2019s economic team are tempering their optimism.Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, said on Wednesday that the Chinese government had shown an unwillingness to negotiate on issues such as intellectual property theft and the forced transfer of the technology of American businesses looking to do business in China.\u201cChina is a problem,\u201d Mr. Kudlow said on the Fox Business Network. \u201cThey have not responded to our asks.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "War by Other Means", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome American officials appear to hope that resumed sanctions on Iran will lead to a popular uprising. Have they thought that through?Ms. Giacomo is a member of the editorial board.In resuming sanctions, Mr. Trump hopes to force Iran to capitulate to unrealistic American demands, including ending all its nuclear activity and ceasing its military role in Syria and Yemen.It\u2019s unclear whether the administration has really considered the potential consequences of its actions. They may have the opposite effect of what is intended, by strengthening Iran\u2019s hard-liners and stoking more regional instability.Crucially, Mr. Trump has failed to enlist Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China \u2014 the major powers that joined the United States in negotiating the nuclear deal \u2014 in his anti-Iran crusade. The Europeans say the deal is in their national security interest; they resent that Mr. Trump has unilaterally upended it.Some analysts say it could eventually benefit competitors eager to replace the dollar as the world\u2019s dominant currency and do long-term damage to the United States.Mr. Trump faces other trouble as well. No matter how painful the reimposed sanctions are, they won\u2019t be as effective as when the major powers were united in their enforcement. China, India and Japan have signaled a willingness to continue at least some purchases from Iran.As history shows, sanctions are most effective when they are applied judiciously and with broad international support. Conversely, the United States and its partners must be willing to remove sanctions when the target country changes its behavior. President Barack Obama saw the nuclear deal as a way to prevent Iran from producing a nuclear weapon, to ease the hostility that has dominated relations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution and to appeal to a new generation of pro-Western Iranians.That not only didn\u2019t happen, but in many ways Iran\u2019s malign regional behavior has grown worse, a bad call by the country\u2019s leaders.Iran is already struggling with a fragile economy and internal unrest, and some American officials hope a tightening vise will lead to a popular uprising. This tough approach, backed by Israel and Saudi Arabia, reached a crescendo last month when Mr. Trump and top advisers used a series of speeches to mount a coordinated verbal attack on Iran\u2019s government and to warn of dark consequences if it doesn\u2019t change its behavior.So could Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-line approach indeed spark regime change? And then what?Despite recent unrest and economic weakening, experts say Iran\u2019s government isn\u2019t expected to fall any time soon.If Mr. Trump had stuck with the nuclear agreement, he would have had the standing to lead an effort with the five other major powers to address concerns over Iran\u2019s military presence in Syria, its missile program, its support for militant groups like Hezbollah, its hostility toward Israel and its backing for Houthi rebels in Yemen. Instead, he has alienated America\u2019s closest allies and set the stage for a conflict that could easily spiral out of control.An earlier version of this editorial misstated the nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. It is not a weapons program.Advertisement"}

The changes in the timeline below reflect that sampling error, not real changes in the race.One reason we\u2019re doing these surveys live is so you can see the uncertainty for yourself. There\u2019s a big question on top of the standard margin of error in a poll: Who is going to vote? It\u2019s a particularly challenging question this year, since special elections have shown Democrats voting in large numbers.To estimate the likely electorate, we combine what people say about how likely they are to vote with information about how often they have voted in the past. In previous races, this approach has been more accurate than simply taking people at their word. But there are many other ways to do it.All estimates based on 737 interviewsEven if we got turnout exactly right, the margin of error wouldn\u2019t capture all of the error in a poll.

We do not.People who respond to surveys are almost always too old, too white, too educated and too politically engaged to accurately represent everyone.Based on administrative records. Some characteristics are missing or incorrect. Many voters are called multiple times.Pollsters compensate by giving more weight to respondents from under-represented groups.

Push factors are the reasons people decide to leave their homeland, and pull factors are the reasons people choose to move to a particular place.Finally, tell us more about what you think: About the caravan as a political issuePresident Trump on Monday sharply intensified a Republican campaign to frame the midterm elections as a battle over immigration and race, issuing a dark and factually baseless warning that \u201cunknown Middle Easterners\u201d were marching toward the American border with Mexico.The unsubstantiated charge marked an escalation of Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to stoke fears about foreigners and crime ahead of the Nov. 6 vote, as he did to great effect in the presidential race.

{"Headline": "So Much for the Starter House", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRight at HomeWith inventory tight, home prices high and interest rates rising, many homeowners are giving up on the idea of trading up from the first home they bought.Johanna Lasser had lived in a dozen apartments before she bought her first house two years ago, a rundown Victorian in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. Ms. Lasser and her husband, Jimm, figured they would fix it up, stay a few years and then move on to a house in the suburbs, or one in a better school district, as many people do.It didn\u2019t take long for that plan to stop making sense.\u201cOnce you\u2019ve got all that work done, where would we go in the city except to another place that somebody had just fixed up?\u201d said Ms. Lasser, 40, a stay-at-home mother who\u2019s pregnant with her second child. \u201cWe\u2019d just be switching apples for apples.\u201dWhat happens, though, when the home you think is your starter house becomes your forever house?As first-time home buyers, we often cobble together what we have for a down payment with the expectation that in five years (because, face it, we like to believe that life operates on an endless loop of five-year plans) we\u2019ll upgrade to something larger, or in better condition, or in a better neighborhood. Realizing that we may not actually be able to move runs counter to an American ideal that there\u2019s always a better version of our lives a few pay raises away.But increasingly, the math doesn\u2019t work and we find that we\u2019re not so free to go.A brew of short- and long-term trends has led us to this moment. Millennials, saddled with student debt, are buying their first homes later in life, and so are less likely to move again. Inventory is tight (largely because homeowners aren\u2019t moving), home prices are high, and interest rates are rising. Added to that, the 2017 federal tax overhaul capped the mortgage interest deduction at $750,000 and limited sales and local tax deductions to $10,000 a year, making it less desirable for owners in high-tax states like New York to buy a home with a jumbo mortgage or a giant property-tax bill.In short, if you were lucky enough to lock in a historically low interest rate, whatever you buy today will cost you more than it did just a few months ago. The Lassers, for example, pay roughly $12,000 a year in property taxes for the six-bedroom house that they bought for $1.475 million in 2016. But if they decided to move to the suburbs, their property taxes would likely be higher, and if they bought a house priced at or more than what they paid for their current home, their monthly mortgage payments would be substantially higher at current interest rates. \u201cWith our next purchase, we will have less buying power,\u201d Ms. Lasser said. After the couple finishes bringing the house back to its original glory \u2014 a $350,000 project that will involve restoring the original exterior and interior details, gut renovating four of the six bathrooms and renovating the kitchen \u2014 she doubts they\u2019ll actually want to leave.\u201cIf you\u2019ve gone through one remodel, I don\u2019t think you ever want to do it again,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd where would we go?\u201dNow, rather than scrolling Zillow listings, the couple is paying closer attention to their neighborhood schools, a detail they had overlooked when they bought the place because they figured they\u2019d be gone by the time their daughter, now 4, was old enough for elementary school. \u201cWe were not at all prepared for her being in elementary or middle school in the city,\u201d she said.There are upsides to abandoning the idea of the next house. People who have lived in one place for a long time report feeling better, healthier and more content, according to Ms. Warnick. \u201cImagine if you channeled some of that restless energy into building strong relationships with people in your neighborhood or planning the block party?\u201d she said.But if you bought your home during one life stage, it may not necessarily fit so well with the next one. Mary Botel, 38, bought a 750-square foot bungalow in Portland, Ore., in 2011 for $100,000, when she was single. At the time, she thought it was a good deal and a great place to live for a few years. Seven years later, she is married and now shares the tiny space with her husband, Blaine Botel, 35, and his teenage son. The quarters are tight, requiring the family to pare down on their possessions and stay organized. \u201cEverything now has to have a place,\u201d she said.Initially the neighborhood was rough \u2014 her car was stolen once and so were her boots, snatched off the front porch in the middle of winter. But as the economy improved, so too did the neighborhood. Now apartments in the rental building next door rent for about $1,400 a month, substantially more than Mrs. Botel\u2019s mortgage payments. \u201cIf we were to move today, even if we sold, our money wouldn\u2019t go very far,\u201d said Mrs. Botel, who works for Multnomah County, Ore.Although the Botels would like to have more space, they\u2019ve also begun to see the upside of their small home. \u201cWe like having a place that is tiny and easy to clean and easy to repair,\u201d she said.

{"Headline": "Saudis Issued Dire Warnings Against U.S. Sanctions. But How Much Leverage Do They Have?", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThese threats by Saudi Arabia\u2019s monarchy in recent days were its answer to America\u2019s own threats of punishment over the disappearance and reported killing and dismemberment of a dissident journalist that has shocked the world.Yet petroleum and defense experts have largely discounted such possibilities.While Saudi Arabia is still the leading producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and can exert enormous influence over oil prices, it is no longer the energy superpower that American motorists feared during the Arab oil embargo era of the 1970s.And as longstanding clients of the American arms industry, the Saudis cannot easily switch to other providers.\u201cThey depend more on us than we depend on them,\u201d said Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington.Here is a look at Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic leverage over the United States \u2014 or absence of it \u2014 and why it matters.To some degree, yes.The United States is far less dependent on Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members than even a decade ago, when a drilling frenzy began in shale fields across Texas and North Dakota. American production has more than doubled since 2007 \u2014 to 10.5 million barrels a day, from 5.1 million barrels a day \u2014 and the United States has become a major exporter for the first time in decades.The United States imports only 800,000 barrels a day from Saudi Arabia \u2014 600,000 fewer per day than a decade ago \u2014 and much of that goes to a Gulf of Mexico refinery owned by Saudi Aramco, the Saudi national oil company.A cutoff of Saudi oil, which represents less than 5 percent of American supplies, would harm Aramco and cut Saudi government revenue. And the United States could replace those supplies with oil from other countries or from its own fields.Jason Bordoff, a Columbia University professor and founding director of its Center on Global Energy Policy, said that while the Saudis have a significant ability to curtail production and raise the price, it is a weapon they are unlikely to use.\u201cIt would have a severe negative impact on the global economy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also would be very self-defeating. It would undermine the reputation they built as a reliable supplier for 45 years.\u201dBut while President Trump has made much of Saudi Arabia as a critical client of United States defense contractors, punctuated by its commitment last year to purchase $110 billion in American weapons, much of that commitment has yet to be fulfilled.Some experts said that even if Congress moves ahead to penalize the Saudis by suspending arms sales \u2014 as appeared increasingly likely in recent days \u2014 the economic impact on the United States would not necessarily be painful.\u201cIt would hurt the stockholders of the defense companies, but these companies will do just fine without these weapons sales,\u201d Mr. Kimball said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they\u2019re Sears Roebuck.\u201dYes and no.Saudi Arabia welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear accord and the resumption of American sanctions, which have cut Iran\u2019s ability to sell oil. But the United States is depending on Saudi Arabia to replace Iranian supplies that had been going to Asian markets.A collapse of American-Saudi cooperation would undercut their mutual goal of ostracizing the Iranian government. Any reduction in Saudi exports would be welcomed by Iran, the kingdom\u2019s archenemy, which would benefit from an increase in prices.David Goldwyn, who was the State Department\u2019s top energy official in the first Obama administration, said the Saudi threat to curtail production had not been taken seriously by the oil markets, so far at least.Any Saudi curtailment, he said, \u201cwould undermine their primary foreign policy objective, which is containment of Iran.\u201dThe Saudis, Mr. Goldwyn said, are also loath to create economic conditions that would accelerate shifts to electric vehicles, hastening the obsolescence of their primary export.Memories of oil embargoes by Saudi Arabia and OPEC, and the gasoline lines that they caused a half century ago, are fading. Still, Saudi Arabia is an oil power with persistent influence over prices.It currently produces more than 10 percent of the world\u2019s supplies. As Venezuela\u2019s production plummets because of political problems, and as renewed American oil sanctions on Iran bite further, the Saudi influence will be amplified.Ed Hirs, an energy economics professor at the University of Houston, said a threat to the oil markets lurked if Congress were to cut arm sales to Saudi Arabia.In response, he said, the Saudis \u201ccould cut production, which would raise the price of oil, which would have a negative impact on the U.S. economy \u2014 or they could increase production dramatically and drive the crude price down, which would damage the U.S. oil industry incredibly.\u201dIn recent months, Saudi Arabia has increased its production and exports to help satisfy Asian customers worried about supplies. The kingdom has coordinated with Russia, which is also increasing production, further relieving price pressures. And OPEC has gone along with the supply increases, despite complaints from Iran.At the same time, the Trump administration is eager to keep gasoline prices low, especially as the midterm elections approach.A diplomatic fight between the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United States would normally unsettle oil traders, but oil prices have remained stable in recent days, with the benchmark Brent crude selling in the $80-per-barrel range.Concerns about a slowing global economy and reports of ample stockpiles have outweighed any worries about a possible rift between the Saudi kingdom and the Trump administration.\u201cThe market is shrugging it off,\u201d Michael C. Lynch, the president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, a Massachusetts-based consultancy, who sometimes advises OPEC.\u201cPeople know that the Saudis don\u2019t want to chase away customers by suggesting their oil supplies are not secure,\u201d he said, \u201cand they think Trump will accept whatever explanation the Saudis give in the end, because he doesn\u2019t want to lose his big defense contracts.\u201dOthers, however, suggested that the oil market was not impervious to the crisis over Mr. Khashoggi, especially because the case has raised basic questions of judgment and leadership in the Saudi royal family.\u201cPreviously, we imagined Saudi Arabia as a bulwark not only in a regional alliance system, but also as the main keeper of stability in the oil market,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, a Middle East oil analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cNow, the success of that whole role is being called into question, and the fragility of that stature has been revealed.\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}

That\u2019s not surprising: Lawmakers are still in the early stages of figuring out what new privacy rules should look like, so industry groups are doing what they can now to shape their thinking.The U.S. labor market is in its best shape in decades, with unemployment averaging about 4 percent this year. But wage growth has stagnated, puzzling economists.\u2022 More slack in the labor market could mean that the economy can support more work than is actually being created.\u2022 A slowdown in productivity gains, so that the value of what workers produce is growing more slowly than in the past.\u2022 Rising inequality, which could reduce upward mobility and weaken the bargaining power of unions to negotiate raises.Mr. Tedeschi\u2019s conclusion: \u201cAlthough the unemployment rate may look the way it did in boom times in 2000, for many Americans, wage growth has much further to go.\u201dThe Trump administration wants NASA to focus on ambitious challenges like sending astronauts to Mars. Some of the money to make that happen is supposed to come from handing off parts of space exploration to the private sector. The federal government, for instance, plans to cut direct financing of the International Space Station after 2024.Companies like Bigelow are years from launching their space stations, and such expensive, cutting-edge projects often slip behind schedule. Critics worry that the International Space Station might be discarded before its successors are ready. A gap without space stations would disrupt NASA\u2019s studies, as well as emerging commercial endeavors.

{"Headline": "Powerful Executives Have Stepped Away From the Saudis. Not SoftBank\u2019s.", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySince the disappearance and apparent killing of a dissident journalist in a Saudi Arabian consulate, some of the most powerful figures in business are distancing themselves from the kingdom. There is one prominent exception: Masayoshi Son, chief executive of the SoftBank Group.Mr. Son, the 61-year-old founder of SoftBank, the Japanese internet, energy and financial conglomerate that owns Sprint, is one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s biggest business partners. His company oversees the SoftBank Vision Fund, a technology investment fund that sought $100 billion in investments and received the promise of $45 billion from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund.In the two years since then, the Vision Fund has become the largest private equity fund in the world, with beneficiaries that include Uber, WeWork and Slack \u2014 some of the world\u2019s most successful start-ups.The success or failure of the joint venture has enormous ramifications for both sides. And now, an investment conference that was to be a triumphant display of the kingdom\u2019s economic modernization has instead become a painful referendum on its human-rights record.As of Wednesday, Mr. Son had not publicly said whether he would attend the conference, known as the Future Investment Initiative, which is scheduled for next week in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia\u2019s capital.A SoftBank spokesman, who would not allow his name to be used, said that Mr. Son would wait for more information before he made a decision about attending the conference.SoftBank\u2019s chief operating officer, Marcelo Claure, said on Tuesday that the company was \u201cmonitoring\u201d the reports about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.\u201cAt this point in time, we, like most companies that have a relationship with Saudi Arabia, are watching developments and seeing where this goes,\u201d Mr. Claure told a group of reporters at a tech industry event in San Jose, Calif. \u201cThere are developments pretty much every hour these days.\u201dMr. Son has pointed out to business associates that the SoftBank Vision Fund had a responsibility to the Saudi citizens who had entrusted his company with $45 billion from their kingdom\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, according to SoftBank officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. At the same time, these officials said, he has conveyed to executives at companies in the Vision Fund\u2019s portfolio that they should not feel obligated to follow his lead, and must do what feels right to them.It is a delicate balance for Mr. Son, who is on the one hand receiving investment capital from a conservative nation that built its vast wealth with oil and on the other hand using that very wealth to fund progressive young companies with a different set of values.Since Turkish officials accused the Saudis of ordering the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, a spate of foreign chief executives including Mr. Dimon, Mr. Khosrowshahi, Stephen Schwarzman of Blackstone Group and Laurence D. Fink of BlackRock has withdrawn from the conference. All their companies have financial interests in the kingdom.Mr. Dimon\u2019s company has an office in Riyadh with about 70 employees. Mr. Schwarzman\u2019s firm started an infrastructure fund backed by as much as $20 billion from Saudi Arabia. Mr. Fink\u2019s company manages billions of dollars for Saudi Arabia\u2019s central bank. And Mr. Khosrowshahi\u2019s company received a $3.5 billion investment from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, known as the Public Investment Fund, in 2016. The managing director of the fund sits on Uber\u2019s board.But those executives are not as deeply enmeshed with the Saudis as Mr. Son.Mr. Son is \u201ccertainly in an uncomfortable position,\u201d said Colin C. Blaydon, director emeritus of the Center for Private Equity and Entrepreneurship at Dartmouth\u2019s Tuck School of Business. \u201cEveryone is sort of stepping back to wait and see how all of this plays out,\u201d he added, \u201cand the question for the immediate, for someone like Mr. Son, is, will there be a short-term solution around this conference that then gives some breathing room to try and figure out what comes next?\u201dThe Saudis\u2019 partnership with the SoftBank Vision Fund in October 2016 was intended as a shining example of the country\u2019s entrance into a cutting-edge economy.In April of that year, Prince Mohammed, the king\u2019s son and now his heir apparent, unveiled Vision 2030, his blueprint for a more diverse, less oil-dependent kingdom. As part of that plan, he would float shares of Saudi Arabia\u2019s national oil company, Aramco, to the public, and use the proceeds of that deal to subsidize the Public Investment Fund, which had ambitious growth plans. The Aramco initial public offering, which was expected to raise at least $100 billion, was delayed in August. However, Prince Mohammed recently said it would happen by 2021.The Public Investment Fund pledged to invest up to $45 billion in the SoftBank Vision Fund over a five-year period. That promise raised the possibility of the Saudis being involved in dozens of promising portfolio companies in areas like artificial intelligence, robotics and ways to link devices over the internet.After the Saudis committed to the Vision Fund, Apple invested $1 billion. So did Oracle\u2019s chief executive, Lawrence Ellison; the manufacturer Foxconn; and the chip maker Qualcomm. During a meeting with president-elect Donald J. Trump shortly before his inauguration, Mr. Son vowed to use Vision Fund capital to invest $50 billion in the United States and create 50,000 new jobs, winning favor with the new administration.\u201cMy goal is to become the Warren Buffett of the tech industry,\u201d Mr. Son said shortly after the fund was set up. \u201cWe\u2019re aiming to be the Berkshire Hathaway of tech.\u201dThe Vision Fund is structured like a private equity fund: Participants agree to an investment amount upfront, but send the money only as individual deals are signed. SoftBank has spent $27 billion of the Vision Fund\u2019s $92 billion in capital as of June 30, according to the company. Saudi Arabia\u2019s share of that would be roughly $12 billion. The fund has invested billions more in the months since.But the financial performance of the Vision Fund so far has been promising enough that Mr. Son has been discussing plans to raise a second Vision Fund \u2014 a plan that Saudi Arabia has said it heartily supports.In an interview with Bloomberg News this month, Prince Mohammed said that the Public Investment Fund would commit another $45 billion to the next Vision Fund. \u201cWithout the P.I.F., there will be no SoftBank vision fund,\u201d he said.But since Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, SoftBank officials have privately contemplated how, in a worst-case scenario, they could distance themselves from Saudi Arabia. One option, according to a person involved in the decision-making, would be to not accept any more of the kingdom\u2019s money.Don Clark contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Afghanistan\u2019s Season of Crisis, \u2018Words Do Not Have the Strength\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKABUL, Afghanistan \u2014 In the past 17 years of war and crisis in Afghanistan, no one remembers a season quite like this one, with peril and hopelessness at every turn. People here struggle for words to explain how it feels.A former minister, fit with healthy habits and hardened by years of battle and politics, said he could barely force himself out of bed in the morning. A young professional, after years of dedicated work in civil society and government jobs, teared up as she tried to explain why she was losing hope, her usual clarity choked by emotion. A poet in the country\u2019s east said his verse had dried up.\u201cEvery time something bad happened, I would turn to poetry \u2014 it would give me calm,\u201d said the poet, Sajid Bahar, 26, who lives in the city of Khost. \u201cIt\u2019s been seven months that I can\u2019t write. It no longer gives me calm. When I sit down to focus on one incident for a poem, 30 others flash through my head. My words do not have the strength for all of them.\u201dIf there is a common theme in this upswell of alarm and worry that seems so widespread, it is a sense that no one sees any clear path through a minefield of crises.Any one of the problems facing Afghanistan right now would be an urgent national issue. Together, they have created an existential moment.Officials acknowledge the only hope is to bring the Taliban to a political reconciliation through peace talks \u2014 even though the insurgents have offered no convincing indication they are willing to accept any basic tenet of the democratic program here, including elections or hard-earned rights for women. This best-case scenario for ending the war is chilling for an entire generation of politically active young Afghans who do not want to go back to repression or civil war.But many Afghans still believe in the promise of some kind of democracy, and they want to vote even though they are disillusioned. Despite the tensions, and the fact that at least a third of polling stations across the country will not open because of the war, the parliamentary vote will go ahead on Saturday.Geopolitically, worsening American relations with three crucial neighbors of Afghanistan \u2014 Pakistan, Russia and Iran \u2014 have raised fears that those countries will intensify their meddling in the war to punish the United States. Afghan and Western officials say Pakistan refuses to stop sheltering the insurgency\u2019s leaders or use its influence to slow the Taliban\u2019s momentum. And both Russia and Iran, they say, are increasing their aid to the Taliban.In this fragile environment, the physical encroachments of violence have given a new shape to life\u2019s routine in Afghanistan.In Kabul, there is no more visible symbol of the change than the network of concrete blast walls protecting the elite, turning the streets into a maze. Behind those walls, political and diplomatic energy is sapped by problem after problem, each solution offering a bit of relief but no breakthrough toward ending the war.A concerted military and intelligence push over the past month has brought a rare reprieve from suicide bombings. Suspects have been rounded up in large numbers, and insurgent networks disrupted somewhat, officials say.But the fear of that next big bombing remains, and with it a conviction that ordinary Afghans will again bear the brunt. So residents see in those blast walls a reminder of their own vulnerability, and life continues as a daily resistance.Some see the crumbling of an untenable structure created by the foreign presence as a necessary trial by fire to get to a new and more sustainable way.\u201cWe had a fake economy, fake money and fake prosperity. Security was provided by foreigners,\u201d said Mirwais Arya, who has been trying to grow a small chain of burger cafes called Mazadar. \u201cOur role, our input, our understanding was limited.\u201d\u201cMy sense is that the situation will get worse as that fakeness crumbles, that we will reach the edge of collapse before there is a move for the better,\u201d he said. \u201cBut once it crumbles, we will see that underneath, the society has actually transformed.\u201dOthers continue with the routine of advocacy and politics, in the face of tremendous uncertainty. At the core of that resistance is the generation of Afghans who have come of age in the past 17 years, enjoying some happier times and possibilities.President Ghani sees this group as key to escaping the quagmire \u2014 what he has described as putting out a fire in one house while simultaneously building a new foundation next door.He has appointed many young officials to important government jobs, ignoring criticism that he is abandoning experience at a crucial time. But thousands of other youths are fleeing, risking a dangerous trek even when it is clear that Europe has shut its gates.The vote on Saturday is turning into an important contest between an entrenched elite against young, educated Afghans who have decided to stay and try their chances.\u201cThis election is an arena for two generations: one that is about the glories and the grievances of the past, and a younger generation that wants to build the Afghanistan of the future,\u201d said Sami Mahdi, a journalist who is running for a Parliament seat in Kabul.\u201cIn my conversations, people still have a lot of hope in this new generation \u2014 that they can stand against the corruption, against the warlords, against the stereotypes,\u201d Mr. Mahdi said.Muqadessa Ahmadzai, 25, is running in Nangarhar Province, where many districts are under threat from the Taliban or the Islamic State, and where the provincial capital, Jalalabad, has been wrecked by repeated suicide attacks.She says she is running for Parliament to try to correct some of the wrongs of the elites, in any way she can.\u201cWe have not received the kind of representation we expected,\u201d said Ms. Ahmadzai, who led a nonprofit group that established literary hubs in schools for female writers. \u201cNot only did they not fight for our rights, but they actually abused our rights.\u201d She added: \u201cThey are the reason for Afghanistan\u2019s crisis.\u201dThe months ahead will likely prove even more testing to the patience of ordinary Afghans, and to the coherence of the government.The voting on Saturday is likely to produce the kind of localized disputes that will, once again, put the coalition government and its international partners in firefighting mode.Mr. Bahar, the poet, said he was trying a variety of things to ease his mind, like talking long walks.\u201cWe waited a long time, hoping that it would get better next year, and then the year after and then the year after. But it\u2019s not happening,\u201d said Mr. Bahar, the poet. \u201cI will wait another few months, until the presidential elections. If it doesn\u2019t improve, I will have to find a smuggling route to another country.\u201dHe added: \u201cIn a different country, at least I can go up a mountain, sit by the water. At least my mind will be at ease.\u201dZabihullah Ghazi contributed reporting from Jalalabad, Afghanistan.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Dancing Theresa May Calls for Unity Over Brexit", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBIRMINGHAM, England \u2014 The stage set stayed intact, the delivery was smooth, and this time the applause wasn\u2019t prompted by sympathy. A year after her big speech was wrecked by a persistent cough and letters falling from the backdrop, Britain\u2019s prime minister, Theresa May, closed her Conservative Party\u2019s annual conference on Wednesday with an effective speech that combined self-deprecating humor and ironic dance moves with a call for unity.Emerging pretty much unscathed from a potentially treacherous meeting of a party bitterly divided over Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union, Mrs. May demanded its support ahead of a decisive few weeks in Brexit negotiations.Mrs. May\u2019s leadership has been in question ever since that vote, but the public bloodletting at the conference in Birmingham proved less severe than some expected, allowing her to live to fight another day.\u201cShe\u2019s like a really old Jeep, making its way slowly through a rutted field,\u201d said Anand Menon, a professor of European politics and foreign affairs at King\u2019s College London. \u201cYou keep thinking that it\u2019s going to break down, but it inches forward and just keeps on going.\u201dThen it was on to Britain\u2019s exit from the bloc, or Brexit. Mrs. May is scheduled to meet European leaders again this month, and told her party that she would be entering \u201cthe toughest phase of the negotiations.\u201dWith a growing campaign for a second referendum on withdrawal, Mrs. May warned hard-line Euroskeptic critics, \u201cIf we all go off in different directions in pursuit of our own visions of the perfect Brexit, we risk ending up with no Brexit at all.\u201dOn Wednesday, Mrs. May launched a fierce attack on Mr. Corbyn, questioning his patriotism, comparing him unfavorably to some of his predecessors and dismissing his proposals as \u201cbogus solutions that would make things worse.\u201dShe acknowledged, however, that some communities in Britain had been \u201cleft behind\u201d and promised she was \u201cending austerity,\u201d and that there were \u201cbetter days ahead.\u201d Policy pledges included improved cancer treatment and new measures to increase home building.The Conservatives made several other announcements in Birmingham, but they were largely drowned out by the cacophony over Brexit, the culmination of decades of infighting in the party over European policy.The depth of the divisions over Europe was evident from the lengthy lines of activists snaking around the conference center, waiting to hear hard-line supporters of Brexit denounce Mrs. May\u2019s plan for withdrawal.The bad news for Mrs. May is that the argument hasn\u2019t gone away.But hard-line Brexit supporters want a much cleaner break. They hate the idea of keeping some European economic rules over which Britain, as a nonmember country, would have no say, arguing this would render it a \u201cvassal state.\u201dWorse, they know that, if Mrs. May is to reach a deal over Brexit, she will have to compromise further with the European Union.Mrs. May would then need to get any agreement through a Parliament in which she has no majority.At a meeting of the Euroskeptic Bruges Group on the fringes of the conference, there were loud boos at the mention of Oliver Robbins, a senior civil servant and architect of Mrs. May\u2019s Brexit proposals. References to other opponents of a clean break with the European Union were greeted with cries of \u201ctraitors.\u201dMore ominous for Mrs. May was a promise from Owen Paterson, a former cabinet minister, to vote against her Chequers proposal because, he said, \u201cwe won\u2019t have left \u2014 we will be in a much worse position.\u201dDivisive issues remain despite a prime minister\u2019s plea for unity.Advertisement"}

Now, he hopes to use it as a playbook.Problem is, Canada and Mexico were trying to save a pact that has underpinned their economies for a quarter-century. The E.U. and Japan, both in trade talks with the U.S., won\u2019t be so desperate. As Andre Sapir, a former E.U. economic adviser, told the WSJ: \u201cI don\u2019t think Europe will want to enter into such an agreement \u2014 it would want to have balanced agreement.\u201dThe off-the-cuff remarks, the \u201chandsy\u201d office politics, the clubbable sexism are all being noted. And slowly, the penny is dropping. We don\u2019t much care for sexist opinion. And we\u2019re really not impressed by your Rabelaisian past.But Ms. Ellison adds that many accused men, like the comedian Louis C.K., are working again. And the debate over balancing the rights of the accused with those of the accusers is far from over, as the battle over Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination shows. For #MeToo, this may just be the beginning.The sight of Joel Kaplan, Facebook\u2019s top Washington official, sitting behind his friend Brett Kavanaugh at last week\u2019s Senate nomination hearing angered many at the social network. They saw it as a kind of an endorsement from the company.This week, Facebook employees kept flooding internal forums with comments about Mr. Kaplan\u2019s appearance at the hearing. In a post on Wednesday, Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook executive, appeared to dismiss the concerns when he wrote to employees that \u201cit is your responsibility to choose a path, not that of the company you work for.\u201d Facebook plans to hold another staff meeting on Friday to contain the damage, said the current and former employees.After the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the country, the E.U. \u2014 still in the pact \u2014 began trying to shield its companies from the financial penalties. There\u2019s more at stake than one agreement.What the Europeans devised is a \u201cspecial payments entity\u201d to let companies move money in and out of Tehran when Western banks won\u2019t. While big multinationals have already withdrawn from Iran, others haven\u2019t \u2014 and Europeans hope that continued trade will keep the nuclear deal alive. (American officials threatened to crack down on any such move.)The danger for the United States is that the payments mechanism gives the European Union valuable experience operating outside Washington\u2019s financial sphere of influence and becomes a permanent part of the international payments system.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Who Will Be the Face of the \u00a350 Bill? Probably Not a Soccer Player Riding a Unicorn", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe Bank of England isn\u2019t taking nominations yet, but that hasn\u2019t stopped people from offering names and placing bets. The 50-pound bill, worth about $65, is rarely used in everyday life in Britain, but that hasn\u2019t stopped Britons from trying to get their favorites to be the face of a forthcoming design of the note. As soon as the Bank of England announced plans last weekend to redesign the bill, petitions popped up extolling the virtues of a range of worthies. The most popular prospects offer a skewed view of the kind of figures who set British hearts aflutter. There is Noor Inayat Khan, a Muslim woman who spied for Britain during World War II; Margaret Thatcher, the country\u2019s first female prime minister, who remains a sharply divisive figure decades after her tenure; and an English soccer player riding an inflatable unicorn. Technically, there are none yet. The Bank of England said it would begin the formal nomination process soon, and would seek suggestions from the public. The petition to put her on the bank note has attracted thousands of signatures and the support of Sayeeda Warsi, the first Muslim to be appointed to the British cabinet, and Ms. Criado-Perez. There\u2019s one problem (aside from the question of whether unicorns exist): Mr. Maguire is not dead, and apart from the monarch, those portrayed on British notes must be deceased. \u201cWe\u2019ve got nothing better to do with our time,\u201d Mr. Sharples said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking for any distraction.\u201d A review by the Exchequer of how cash is used in Britain had raised the possibility of the \u00a350 bill\u2019s being scrapped, as the note is rarely used for routine purchases and there is \u201ca perception among some that \u00a350 notes are used for money laundering, hidden economy activity and tax evasion.\u201d The bank says that it wants nominees from different backgrounds, and that they have to be widely admired, as well as having made important contributions to society and culture. The last time the Bank of England went through this process, for the \u00a320 note, nearly 590 people from the visual arts were nominated. The artist J.M.W.

{"Headline": "The Gloom Encroaching on Trump\u2019s Stock Boom", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe good times President Trump brought to the stock market may be ending.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down nearly 7 percent from its peak in late September, and the Nasdaq index, which includes many hot technology stocks, has fallen nearly 10 percent from its high.Doubts appear to be overwhelming investors\u2019 bullishness. They are concerned that Mr. Trump\u2019s bellicose trade policy will disrupt corporate America\u2019s supply chains and push up costs. Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts have contributed to a ballooning fiscal deficit. Borrowing costs have also risen this year, which could dampen investment.\u201cDonald Trump has made uncertainty great again,\u201d said David Rosenberg, chief economist of Gluskin Sheff. \u201cHis policies are doing more harm than good.\u201dThe market reaction is a stark reversal. Investors had piled into stocks with abandon for much of Mr. Trump\u2019s presidency. Taxes and regulations were being slashed, earnings were surging and the United States economy was performing better than many of its rivals. The S.&P. 500 is up 28 percent since Election Day 2016.Crucially, to investors, it is not clear when the threats to the stock market will lift. But until they do, stocks could remain weak.The market plunge does not seem to fit with the strong economic data. Unemployment is at a multi-decade low, the economy grew at a 4.2 percent clip last quarter and corporate earnings, the biggest driver of stock prices, are expected to rise more than 20 percent this year.But this good news, according to some analysts, had caused investors to underestimate a number of concerns.\u201cThere was this great sense of complacency,\u201d said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.This could be seen in the stock market\u2019s stretched valuations. Earlier this year, the S.&.P 500\u2019s price-to-earnings ratio, a yardstick that compares stock prices to past earnings, hit its highest level in over 15 years. But investors kept buying stocks in the expectation that the strong earnings growth would continue. Much of the growth this year came from the tax cuts enacted at the end of 2017. As a result, investors expect slower earnings growth in 2019.Not even Mr. Trump\u2019s hard-edge trade policies could shake investor faith in stocks. After the Trump administration forged a trade truce with the European Union over the summer, Wall Street seemed to grow comfortable with the trade war, and stocks resumed their climb.But in recent weeks, investors became newly worried about the trade tensions with China, which the United States has targeted with tariffs on $250 billion of its goods. The battle could now have an outsize effect on the stock market. Technology companies, whose stocks have risen strongly, may be among those most harmed. The tariffs along with China\u2019s retaliatory measures make it harder for them to operate and expand their finely honed supply chains.Investors have also grown concerned about the Federal Reserve. For much of the year, they seemed to believe that the central bank would continue to gradually raise interest rates without significantly slowing the economy and disrupting financial markets. But with a strong United States economy, it\u2019s not clear when the Fed will stop raising interest rates.The growing fiscal deficit illustrates how investors suddenly had to grapple with the flip side of a policy \u2014 Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts \u2014 that they had favored. The lower taxes immediately bolstered companies\u2019 bottom lines, but the federal government\u2019s revenues fell short, forcing the government to sell more debt. The interest payments on Treasury securities are now higher than they were during the Great Recession.In any sell-off, it\u2019s important to keep things in perspective. Even after the past week\u2019s drop, the S.&P. 500 is still up 2 percent this year. Retail investors appear to be well ahead. Households\u2019 holdings of mutual funds have risen by $1.9 trillion since the third quarter of 2016, according to figures from the Federal Reserve.Long-term rallies in stocks are often punctuated with corrections, or declines of 10 percent or more from their most recent high. If another occurred this year, the S.&P. 500 would be down only 1 percent this year. Investors can most likely stomach that. The Fed can always choose to hold off on raising interest rates.Larry Kudlow, President Trump\u2019s economic adviser, on Thursday sought to calm nerves. \u201cIf you have a strong economy, that will provide confidence for stocks, but corrections come and go,\u201d he told CNBC.The big question now is whether the stock market rout is a signal that the economy is set to slow markedly. Analysts are looking at trading patterns to determine whether that is the case. They note that so-called defensive stocks, like utilities, have outperformed companies in other sectors.Bank stocks, which usually do well when the Fed raises interest rates gently, have lagged the wider market for months. Investors may be betting that banks will have less business because the economy is about to slow. A handful of large banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, are scheduled to report third-quarter earnings early Friday.Mr. Paulsen predicts that the economy\u2019s growth rate will fall back toward 2 percent. \u201cIf it does, how will Trump act?\u201d he said.An earlier version of this article misstated in one instance the surname of the analyst who predicted that growth would slow to 2 percent. He is Jim Paulsen of the Leuthold Group, not \u201cMr. Leuthold.\u201dAdvertisement"}

No French president has hosted such an event since 1985, according to Ms. Flay.The 45th edition of FIAC featured 195 galleries from 27 countries. The five-day fair, held in the majestic setting of the Grand Palais, combines contemporary and modern art under one soaring steel-and-glass roof, and attracts about 75,000 visitors, according to the organizers. The Frieze and Frieze Masters fairs, which separate contemporary and modern, each attract 60,000.\u201cIt feels good here in Paris,\u201d said Mr. Brown, who was offering an array of classic blue-chip works from the 1960s by Lucio Fontana and Yves Klein. \u201cWe\u2019re in for a rough time in England.\u201dMs. Grosse\u2019s centerpiece was the monumental \u201cIngres Wood,\u201d a sumptuously pigmented installation of pine trunks on fabric using a recently felled tree planted in Rome by the 19th-century French painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres. It was priced at \u20ac550,000.When it comes to fair venues, FIAC wins hands down over Frieze. The Grand Palais is one of the world\u2019s most spectacular settings for any cultural event. But this signature building will close for renovation soon after the 2020 edition, and will then be used as a venue for the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Possibly. But \u201cFIAC Week,\u201d like \u201cFrieze Week,\u201d is about a lot more than one art fair.Paris Internationale is a pop-up event organized by smaller contemporary galleries seeking to keep costs low. This year\u2019s fair was held in a vacant 19th-century residential building overlooking Parc Monceau in northwest Paris. Forty-two dealers and eight nonprofit ventures squeezed into its rambling domestic spaces.\u201cThis is the best of the 10 things I\u2019ve seen since the end of August,\u201d the globe-trotting Belgian collector Alain Servais said at the crowded Tuesday preview. \u201cDealers are taking risks by bringing artists that have an institutional following, but not a commercial following.\u201dThe reclusive Belgian conceptual artist Jef Geys, for example, who represented Belgium at the 2009 Venice Biennale and who died in February, has an auction high of just $13,125, according to the Artnet price database. At Paris Internationale, Galerie Max Mayer, based in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, presented Geys\u2019s hauntingly ambiguous black lacquer sculpture, \u201cSchildwachten (Darth Vader).\u201d Dating from the early 1990s, it was priced at \u20ac55,000.At the other end of the price spectrum, on view in a bathroom, 650mAh, a nonprofit based in Hove, England, was showing works by Hendrickje Schimmel, a Dutch contemporary artist who works in London. Ms. Schimmel makes pieces that \u201cexist somewhere between sculpture and product,\u201d questioning the preconceptions of the fashion industry. Unwearable shoe sculptures found no early takers, but an altered found cotton shirt sold for \u20ac300.Also on display were lyrical collages incorporating vintage photographs by the New York-based Filipino artist Pinky Urmaza. Eight of these were presented by the Vinyl on Vinyl Gallery of the Philippines. Priced at \u20ac650 to \u20ac790, they quickly sold out.\u201cWe wanted to have a second gallery in Europe, and we do have a lot of clients in this region,\u201d said Robbie Fitzpatrick, a co-founder of the dealership, which was also exhibiting in the first-floor younger galleries section of FIAC. \u201cParis is a global hub.\u201dOnce Britain, and London, formally leave the European Union next March, Paris looks likely to become an increasingly compelling destination in the art world. It certainly will if Mr. Macron has anything to do with it.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the fair where the photograph was taken. It was at Paris Internationale, not FIAC. It also misstated the city in which the nonprofit group 650mAh is a based. It is Hove, England, not London.An earlier version of this article misstated the surname of a founder of the Los Angeles gallery Freedman Fitzpatrick.

{"Headline": "Is a Slowdown in Bank Lending a Bad Sign for the Economy?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySomething is afoot in the world of banking that suggests the economy is not as strong as it looks.Four of the United States\u2019 largest banks on Friday reported third-quarter results that, for the most part, exceeded Wall Street\u2019s expectations.But a worrisome trend again showed up in their numbers: The banks were not lending at the same rate that they had in recent years. While the economy can grow without strong lending, it may struggle to maintain its strength if loan growth remains lackluster.In the third quarter, the combined loans of JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and PNC Financial Services increased just 2 percent from a year earlier, in line with the second-quarter rate. Last year, loans at the four banks grew 2.9 percent, and in 2016 and 2015 the rate was well above 4 percent.Though third-quarter loan growth was subpar, the tax cuts enacted at the end of last year continued to lift bank profits, and rising interest rates are helping banks earn more on their loans. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s earnings surged 24 percent. Wells Fargo, still under regulatory scrutiny after a series of scandals, posted a 32 percent rise in net income, helped, in part, by a decline in costs. Citigroup\u2019s profits were up 12 percent.Earnings at PNC were solidly higher, but its sluggish lending helped send its stock down over 5 percent on Friday. In the third quarter, its loans grew only 0.9 percent, and the banks said growth would be modest in the fourth quarter.It\u2019s probably too early to get alarmed about the slowdown in lending.One of the reasons growth has decelerated should not be a source of concern. Companies, enjoying stronger revenues and lower taxes, have less need to borrow and roll over existing debt when it comes due. William S. Demchak, chief executive of PNC, said Friday that borrowers were paying down their loans more than expected.Another reason for the lower growth is sensible. Bank executives said they saw signs of the economy overheating and were holding back. At Wells Fargo, loans fell 1 percent in the third quarter. Loans to finance the purchase or construction of buildings used by businesses drove the decline. John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo\u2019s chief financial officer, said Friday that the bank had stayed cautious in lending to the sector out of a desire to maintain \u201ccredit discipline.\u201dStill, the weak lending growth could be a sign that the economy is losing momentum.Take mortgages: Rising interest rates are pushing up the cost of mortgages at the same time housing prices in many parts of the country remain elevated. As a result, demand for mortgages has lessened. Wells Fargo\u2019s mortgage applications in the third quarter were lower than in the preceding four quarters.Some companies may be less willing to borrow because their executives are starting to get nervous that President Trump\u2019s trade policies and other geopolitical developments could weigh on global growth. JPMorgan Chase\u2019s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, sounded a warning about global uncertainties in a statement accompanying the bank\u2019s third-quarter earnings report. JPMorgan\u2019s loan growth, at 4.4 percent, was the strongest of the four banks that reported, but it was still well below the rates it posted in 2016 and 2015.Notably, there are signs outside of the banks\u2019 balance sheets of a weakening in credit growth. Companies borrow in the bond markets, and many loans also end up in special financial entities called collateralized loan obligations. But corporate bond issues were down 15.6 percent this year through September, compared with the same period last year, according to data from Sifma, a financial industry trade group. Debt issued by collateralized loan and debt obligations was down by 47 percent, according to Sifma.Then there is the message that bank stocks are sending. Even with the economy doing well, interest rates rising and the Trump administration\u2019s promises of deregulation, shares in banks have lagged the broader market for months. It\u2019s a sign that investors are not particularly excited about the growth prospects for the core businesses of banking, like lending and trading. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is up 3.5 percent this year. Bank stocks, measured using the KBW Nasdaq Bank index, is down 5.9 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia and U.S. Clash Over Khashoggi Case", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf Saudi Arabia \u201creceives any action, it will respond with greater action,\u201d the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement, citing the oil-rich kingdom\u2019s \u201cinfluential and vital role in the global economy.\u201dSaudi Arabia \u201caffirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether by threatening to impose economic sanctions, using political pressures, or repeating false accusations,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said.The \u201caccusations\u201d at issue are the claims of Turkish officials that a team of Saudi agents killed and dismembered Mr. Khashoggi, a United States resident and columnist for The Washington Post who was last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on the afternoon of Oct. 2.The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and other Saudi officials have said they have no knowledge of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fate.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has demanded an explanation.Those leaks have contributed to rising pressure from Congress and other Western governments for Saudi Arabia to explain what happened. Although security camera footage shows Mr. Khashoggi entering the consulate, no evidence has emerged that shows him exiting. His fianc\u00e9e has said she waited outside into the night.The foreign ministers of all three European governments said in the statement that they \u201cexpect the Saudi Government to provide a complete and detailed response\u201d and that \u201cwe have conveyed this message directly to the Saudi authorities.\u201dIn Washington, lawmakers of both parties had already demanded some sanctions if Saudi Arabia is proved responsible for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, and on Sunday, more added their voices.The moral credibility of the United States, Mr. Rubio said, \u201cis undermined and compromised if we somehow decide that because an ally who is important did that, we\u2019re not going to call it out.\u201dThe threats of retaliation from the West sent the Saudi stock market plunging as much as 7 percent on Sunday, the first day of the business week in the kingdom.The Saudi statement criticizing Mr. Trump did not repeat the previous assertions of the crown prince and others that Mr. Khashoggi had left the consulate freely. But the statement also offered no further information about his disappearance.On Friday, a Saudi delegation led by Prince Khaled bin Faisal visited Ankara to meet with Mr. Erdogan. Prince Khaled, 78, is a senior member of the family, the governor of Mecca, and an adviser to King Salman, so his role in the mission underscored the seriousness of the crisis in the eyes of the king.But Prince Khaled\u2019s delegation left Ankara after a few hours without making any statement. Then late Sunday night, King Salman himself called Mr. Erdogan. A semiofficial Turkish news agency said they had discussed the importance of a joint investigation.Mr. Trump has embraced Saudi Arabia as his administration\u2019s pre-eminent Arab ally. He made Riyadh the destination of his first foreign trip as president, and his White House has been especially supportive of the 33-year old crown prince. Mr. Trump repeatedly expressed his confidence in the young prince even while he was still challenging older family members for dominance of the royal court.The Saudi statement on Sunday was the first sign of tension between the president and the crown prince.Until now, Prince Mohammed has had nothing but high praise for Mr. Trump, even after potentially awkward statements like his campaign pledge to ban Muslims from entering the United States or his more recent demands that Saudi Arabia pay more for its own defense.\u201cYou might not be there for two weeks without us,\u201d Mr. Trump recently said he had told King Salman.Mr. Trump\u2019s statements about Mr. Khashoggi, however, may have touched a nerve.\u201cAs of this moment, they deny it and they deny it vehemently,\u201d he later said, adding, \u201cCould it be them? Yes.\u201dMr. Trump, though, repeated his opposition to any suggestion that the United States curtail its weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest arms buyers in the world. If the United States cut off the lucrative arms sales, \u201cwe would be punishing ourselves,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Steady Hands at the Treasury and the Fed Comfort Investors", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsU.S. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin has resisted any pressure from President Trump to label China as a currency manipulator.China again escaped being named as a currency manipulator by the U.S. Treasury on Wednesday \u2014 a rational decision that offered some comfort to investors.President Trump has repeatedly called on the U.S. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin to label China a currency manipulator. The renminbi has weakened relative to the U.S. dollar by about 6 percent this year, and Mr. Mnuchin said earlier this month that China\u2019s currency moves would be an important part of trade talks.But he also told Reuters that the twice-yearly currency report is not a political document. By law, a major U.S. trading partner has to meet three criteria to be labeled a manipulator, including one-sided intervention in currency markets. The Treasury\u2019s report found that China\u2019s exchange-rate practices continue to lack transparency, but that direct intervention this year had been limited.Being labeled a manipulator would have limited consequences for China. Trade actions after a year of talks would probably be the most significant potential reprisal, but U.S. tariffs have already moved well beyond that. Since the last Treasury currency report in April, the United States has imposed duties on about $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, which accounts for about half of total imports.Still, the Treasury\u2019s verdict is a decision made by the book.The department has also been consistent in its reviews of foreign deals. Under President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States took a fairly tough line on Chinese deals given a raft of intellectual property theft cases. Under the leadership of Mr. Mnuchin, the panel has followed that playbook, with Congress recently granting it expanded powers.The Federal Reserve, led by Chairman Jerome Powell, has also maintained its autonomy. The president has attacked the central bank in recent interviews for raising interest rates too much, but Fed policymakers appear unmoved. They are likely to raise rates again in December, according to the minutes of last month\u2019s meeting, which were released on Wednesday.Mr. Trump told Fox News this week that the Fed was his biggest threat, but added that \u201cit\u2019s independent so I don\u2019t speak to them.\u201d Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s Treasury Department isn\u2019t insulated from Mr. Trump in the same way \u2014 but it hasn\u2019t yet been swayed.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Interest Rates Are Rising for All the Right Reasons", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHere\u2019s what the bond market is really telling us about the economic future.The cost to borrow money is on the rise. That is bad news for home buyers and other prospective borrowers. It helped cause a stock market sell-off on Wednesday and Thursday, and prompted President Trump to say that the Federal Reserve has \u201cgone crazy.\u201dBut it amounts to good news for the long-term direction of the economy.In effect, the multi-trillion dollar global bond market is signaling a little greater confidence than it did just a few weeks ago that the nine-year expansion in the United States may have room to keep going for years to come, and without inflation taking off.But beyond those headline numbers, the details of how the prices of different types of securities have moved relative to one another tell a story that is decidedly optimistic.For much of the last couple of years, short-term interest rates, which the Fed controls directly, have risen much faster than longer-term rates, which are set based on global supply and demand for bonds. The Fed was plowing ahead with rate increases, while investors were evidently skeptical that growth would be persistent enough to justify higher long-term rates.Since then, longer-term rates have risen faster than shorter-term ones. While the yield curve remains flat by historical standards (the gap between 10-year and two-year bonds was up to only 0.33 percent in recent days), it has moved in a direction consistent with a more optimistic outlook.\u201cThe long end of the yield curve has finally moved to the view that this could be a more persistent recovery,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. \u201cIt\u2019s reflecting the possibility that this recovery has further legs.\u201dBut, crucially, the higher long-term interest rates don\u2019t seem to be driven by expectations that inflation will soar higher.The yields of inflation-protected bonds have moved mostly in lock step with traditional bonds in recent weeks, suggesting that traders haven\u2019t become more worried about inflation.In previous years, financial markets have been doubtful that the Fed would follow through with its forecasts for rate increases. Now the Fed\u2019s own projections are consistent with the path of rate increases priced into markets.\u201cThe market seems to have accepted the Fed\u2019s rate path,\u201d said Megan Greene, chief economist at Manulife Asset Management.Moreover, Roberto Perli of Cornerstone Macro calculates that a big part of the higher rates is an increase in the \u201cterm premium.\u201d That means investors are demanding more compensation than they did a few weeks ago for tying their money up for many years. This implies they now see a greater possibility that growth and short-term interest rates could surprise by rising faster than forecasters now project.\u201cThe markets are bringing up their expectations for growth, and have been bringing them up all year,\u201d Mr. Perli said. \u201cThe trend is clearly up, and the market is betting that will continue.\u201dOf course, there are downsides to the higher rates. The recent stock market volatility has been fueled in part by the realization that higher rates will mean higher borrowing costs for corporations.The average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 4.9 percent, from below 4 percent at the end of 2017, according to data from Freddie Mac.\u201cWe are getting into that zone where the typical mortgage payment is increasing much faster than incomes, and that\u2019s going to put a brake on some markets,\u201d said Aaron Terrazas, a senior economist at the real estate site Zillow.In effect, higher mortgage rates could depress the rate of price appreciation of houses, as home buyers cannot bid as aggressively for properties as they could when rates were lower.And markets, even deep and liquid ones like the bond market, aren\u2019t always right, and are frequently wrong. No one would argue that the details of the yield curve, for example, offer some unassailable prediction of the future.But for all the stock market palpitations and risks to particular interest-rate sensitive industries, the message to take from the recent rise in interest rates is an unambiguously good one: This expansion may have some life in it yet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Bizarre Tale of the \u2018Dinosaur Artist\u2019 Who Trafficked in Stolen Fossils", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.In 2013, the United States literally arrested the skeleton of a giant apex predator dinosaur slumbering in a warehouse in Queens. But understanding how this came to be first requires a panoptic survey of everything from the world of the Late Cretaceous period to the 1990s rise of right-wing politics in Mongolia. This is the dizzying task that Paige Williams, a staff writer for The New Yorker, has set for herself in \u201cThe Dinosaur Artist: Obsession, Betrayal and the Quest for Earth\u2019s Ultimate Trophy.\u201d What began for her as the tale of an unusual court case involving a rogue fossil hunter unspools in this book into a wide-ranging examination of the ways that commercialism, ambition, politics and science collide. (Just a glance at some of the index\u2019s entries reveals the scope: Genghis Khan, Newt Gingrich, St. Augustine, Stegosaurus and Preet Bharara.)The life of a globe-trotting dinosaur smuggler might bring to mind Thomas Crown meets Tintin, but one of the revelations of the book is just how mundane the skulduggery of Prokopi\u2019s crime actually was. He simply went to trade shows, saw who was dealing hot fossils in the open and made contacts. After repeated jaunts across the world to meet with an extremely shady (and often extremely drunken) Mongolian middleman, Prokopi establishes a pipeline for his purloined paleontological finds. As a reader, being given entry by Williams into this underworld, privy to the secret knowledge of a black market, is a thrill.As Prokopi\u2019s financial situation becomes increasingly tenuous, these dinosaur bones become his only hope for avoiding ruin. \u201cA batch of dinosaurs would put everything straight,\u201d Williams writes at one point, as the noose tightens. It\u2019s hard not to feel for Prokopi, who ultimately ends up in prison for his smuggling. The only crime that would seem to separate him from the other dealers who had long peddled hot bones in the open at the Tucson Gem & Mineral Society, and elsewhere, is sheer audacity \u2014 that is, flying too close to the sun on the pathetic, undersize forearms of T. bataar.The strange underground world Prokopi inhabits inevitably brings us in contact with some serious oddballs, each of whom is introduced by Williams with the economy and evocative precision of a haiku. In affectless, purposeful prose we get a stream of increasingly strange and piquant factoids about these people, who seem to emerge straight out of a Coen brothers movie: One fossil dealer likes cockroaches, Milton Friedman and Greek triremes. Prokopi\u2019s mother is a nudist, while his mentor is a former door-to-door crab salesman who once won a soap-selling contest. The father of a character introduced in the epilogue has a \u201clove affair\u201d with a bottlenose dolphin \u2014 although, by that point in the book, nothing would seem eccentric enough to warrant surprise. All of this is presented from a narrative God\u2019s-eye view, and Williams so skillfully conceals the sausage-making of reporting that when we\u2019re told, for instance, what someone was thinking while urinating in the desert in the middle of the night several years ago, we accept it as truth.But where the strange, seedy human world of the dinosaur artist is richly realized, less so is the alien world of the dinosaur at the center of the story itself. There is no introduction to the lost world these monsters stalked, what Mongolia was like 70 million years ago, or how a creature as preposterous as T. bataar ever came to exist on our planet. Besides a few unavoidable references to the creature\u2019s specifications and bite strength, for the most part the dinosaur at the center of the story serves the role of MacGuffin.That\u2019s because at heart, this is not a book about dinosaurs, it\u2019s a book about people; a true-crime book, and a thoroughly reported one at that. It is peppered with useful pr\u00e9cis on towering figures from natural history \u2014 we join the 19th-century naturalist and savant Mary Anning, for instance, plying the Jurassic Coast for ichthyosaurs, and stand with the father of Deep Time himself, James Hutton, as he stares down the abyss of time represented in an outcrop in Scotland, contemplating the successive layers of earth that created it. But such potted histories are eddies in the narrative stream that carries Eric Prokopi from taciturn Florida high school swim star to eventual bone smuggler and felon.In the end Prokopi, like T. bataar, remains something of a cipher in spite of Williams\u2019s nanoscale examination of him, his family, friends, associates, finances, even home d\u00e9cor. Sometimes this intimacy borders on overexposure, though it also produces some arresting vignettes: One of the most effective passages meticulously recounts Prokopi\u2019s drive to prison in order to surrender \u2014 a trip rendered both comically mundane and dreadful. But Prokopi himself, who doesn\u2019t say much and seems constitutionally incapable of showing his cards, remains elusive.Instead, the book\u2019s most memorable character may be Mongolia itself, a rugged physical and political terrain that defies easy generalization or the exoticizing accounts of Westerners. We pick up the thread with the mind-blowing global conquests of Genghis Khan and follow it through to the early 20th century, and the accounts of the American naturalist and inveterate self-promoter Roy Chapman Andrews, who briefly descended on Mongolia on behalf of the American Museum of Natural History, forging there a romantic persona as a man committed to digging up dinosaurs. Andrews\u2019s life is almost too colorful to recount, and the contributions he made to popular interest in paleontology were real and lasting. But as with many sepia-toned institutional heroes, the luster of his accomplishments has dimmed in retrospect, not least because he minimized the contributions of his Mongolian assistants in service of a queasy American imperialism. In 1932, the Natural History Museum pulled out of the country as Mongolia descended into Stalinist Communism, executing 30,000 intellectuals and Buddhist leaders, eradicating traditional garb, Mongolian vertical script and Khan as a symbol of national pride \u2014 all bourgeois indulgences.Sixty years later, when Communism fell, the country was once more flooded with opportunistic Americans, many of them hatched in right-wing American think tanks. It was in the wake of this post-Soviet moment of free-market national ransacking that Prokopi found an opening to extract the country\u2019s dinosaur heritage. But just as Khan was suddenly loosed from his symbolic exile and restored as a totem of national pride when Communism fell, when Prokopi falls, hope for a future of Mongolian self-determination comes in the form of a far more ancient, even fiercer symbol of restored national pride: T. bataar.Peter Brannen is the author of \u201cThe Ends of the World.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Global Stock Markets Show Mixed Results Day After Big Drop on Wall St.", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byConcerns over China\u2019s economy continue to weigh on investors.Concerns over China's economy have dragged on stocks this month. China\u2019s currency, the yuan, hit a 21-month low, amid the tariff fight between China and the United States, the world\u2019s largest economies. \u201cPerceptions in markets are evolving, and more people are nervous that this is going to be a long, drawn-out affair,\u201d said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance, a trade group and research provider. China\u2019s government on Friday reported that the economy grew by 6.5 percent over the three months that ended in September compared with a year ago. But growing concerns about the health of its economy, along with rising interest rates that could slow the American economy, have made investors jumpy and worried that a near-perfect investing environment \u2014 low inflation, strong growth and relatively low interest rates \u2014 is becoming tougher to navigate. Here\u2019s a briefing on what has been happening in the stock market. Investors are concerned that rising borrowing costs could crimp domestic growth. Small stocks, which are particularly susceptible to higher borrowing costs, fell 1.8 percent. And other interest-rate sensitive areas of the stock market have been beaten up in recent weeks. The S.&P. home-building index is down 10 percent this month, as mortgage rates have pushed above 5 percent. We\u2019re in the middle of earnings season \u2014 and results from companies could help assuage the worst concerns. On the whole, results should be good. When they\u2019re tallied in a few weeks, profits for S.&P. 500 companies are expected to be up more than 20 percent, compared with last year. That\u2019s largely thanks to strong economic growth in the United States and deep corporate tax cuts. But on Thursday, investors seemed to find gloom even in good earnings news. United Rentals \u2014 a company that rents out construction and industrial equipment \u2014 tumbled 15 percent after reporting earnings that were better than expected. Investors did not like the look of softer-than-expected rental price growth, which can be a leading indicator of a slowdown in the highly cyclical rental industry. \u201cInvestors look at slowing rate growth and say, \u2018Well that\u2019s a negative signal,\u2019\u201d said Steven Fisher, who covers United Rentals as an equity analyst at UBS.

Not to a staged production,\u201d he said while campaigning in Rochester.\u201cDo we live in a tyranny?\u201d he added in an interview. \u201cHe gets to create the rules and we get to show up?\u201dThe latest wrangling inspired more ridicule of and from both candidates. Mr. Molinaro accused the governor of ruling by fiat and suggested that Mr. Cuomo was disrespecting Jewish voters by offering to hold the debate during the Sabbath.The governor\u2019s supporters pointed out that Mr. Molinaro had once declared that he would debate Mr. Cuomo \u201cstanding up, sitting down, in a chair, at the fair \u2014 with a fox, in a box, in a plane, on a train,\u201d suggesting that he was being hypocritical by refusing a proffered opportunity.Mr. Molinaro said he stood by his earlier declaration \u2014 \u201cas long as it includes voters,\u201d he said, adding that such short notice would not give New Yorkers an opportunity to tune in or prepare questions. In a later statement, he said he would gladly accept the Saturday morning invitation so long as television cameras were also present.But if the prolonged spat yielded no greater clarity on whether voters would get to hear or see Mr. Molinaro and Mr. Cuomo trade ideas on the subway crisis, homelessness or the upstate economy in the two weeks remaining before Election Day, it did illuminate one thing: the disadvantage Mr. Molinaro must overcome for an upset on Nov. 6.\u201cHe was making some headway by challenging the governor to a debate, and the governor refusing to do it,\u201d said former Senator Alfonse M. D\u2019Amato, a Republican who is supporting Mr. Cuomo\u2019s re-election bid. But rejecting Mr. Cuomo\u2019s offer, Mr. D\u2019Amato continued, \u201cdestroys his attack that up until now has been probably one of his most effective things.\u201dMr. Molinaro scoffed at the idea that he should accept simply to boost his candidacy. \u201cNew Yorkers are being treated like they\u2019re props in a play. And I\u2019m not going to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it means something good for me.\u201dBut if he was hoping for a better offer, he will likely be disappointed.That, at least, was what Mr. Cuomo seemed to suggest in his radio interview. When asked if he would be willing to sit for the debate on Monday, if Saturday did not work out, Mr. Cuomo demurred.\u201cYeah. Well, I\u2019ll be here tomorrow,\u201d he said. \u201cMonday, I have a schedule.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misstated the date of the midterm election. It is Nov. 6, not Nov. 4.Jesse McKinley contributed reporting from Rochester.Advertisement"}

This week\u2019s graph takes a very different take on fast food and shows the positive relationship between a country\u2019s increase in wealth and the increase in fast-food sales.Jesse of Brooklyn had an interesting headline \u201cFast Food Preys on the Poor.\u201d Discuss with your class whether there is evidence of this in the graph or do you have other knowledge that supports this headline. Good noticing and wondering leads to snappy headlines.Here are some questions you may want to think about critically.\u2022 Notice that only 18 of the 50 points are labeled with the country name. What do you think are the common characteristics of this subgroup?\u2022 This graph is divided by the axes into 4 quadrants. Notice that the lower right quadrant contains the least number of points. Why do you think this is so?\u2022 The graph\u2019s axes are not actual values but percentage change for the time period 2010 to 2015. Several of you remarked that this resulted in countries having a different order than expected. For example, the United States is close to the origin (0 change in wealth and 0 change in fast food sales). Why do you think that the graph\u2019s designer used percentage change?Thank you for participating in \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u201d, which is intended to help you think more critically about graphs and the underlying data. Critical thinking is an essential element of statistics, the science of learning from data. Data visualizations, like these graphs, are an important part of statistics. They help us to understand and learn from data.Keep noticing and wondering. We continue to welcome your responses.________SCATTERPLOTA scatterplot is a graph that is used to display the relationship between two quantitative variables.The relationship between the two variables are described by its direction (positive or upward, negative or downward, or no clear direction), form (linear, curved, scattered, etc.), strength (which is rated from strong to moderate to weak based on how \u201ctight\u201d the form is), and unusual data points that fall outside of the pattern.In the worldwide fast food and wealth graph, the two quantitative variables are percent change in fast food sales (vertical axis, y-axis) and the percent change in wealth (horizontal axis, x-axis). The direction is positive. The form is scattered. The strength is moderate. The most unusual country is Argentina with a larger change in fast-food sales than would be expected for the change in wealth.QUANTITATIVE & CATEGORICAL VARIABLES Quantitative variables take numerical values that are counts or measurements. They have units and can be ordered. Alternatively, categorical variables (like favorite food) assign labels that place each individual into a particular category.In the worldwide fast food and wealth graph, the two quantitative variables are the percentage change in wealth and in fast-food sales for the period 2010-2015. There is also a categorical variable, which is usually not shown in a scatterplot. It is the stage of the country\u2019s economy, either high income (developed) or the developing categories of lower middle income and upper middle income. The distinction is made by the color of the data point.ASSOCIATION_________The graphs for \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On in This Graph?\u201d are selected in partnership with Sharon Hessney.

{"Headline": "Interpol Chief Meng Hongwei Quits and Is Detained by China", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few hours later, Interpol said it had received Mr. Meng\u2019s resignation \u201cwith immediate effect.\u201dThe detention of Mr. Meng, 64, is an audacious step by the party, even by the standards of the increasingly authoritarian system under the leadership of President Xi Jinping. China has sought legitimacy and a leadership role in international organizations, and Mr. Meng\u2019s appointment in November 2016 as the president of Interpol, the first Chinese head of the global policing agency, was seen by many as a significant step in that direction. His detention undermines that campaign.Mr. Meng\u2019s appointment \u201cwas considered quite an achievement for China and a sign of its international presence and growing influence,\u201d said Julian Ku, a professor at Hofstra University\u2019s Maurice A. Deane School of Law, who has studied China\u2019s relationship with international law.While China may have had its eye on placing its citizens in other top posts at prominent global organizations, \u201cthe fact that Meng was \u2018disappeared\u2019 without any notice to Interpol will undermine this Chinese global outreach effort,\u201d Mr. Ku said. \u201cIt is hard to imagine another international organization feeling comfortable placing a Chinese national in charge without feeling nervous that this might happen.\u201dThe announcement of Mr. Meng\u2019s detention came hours after his wife, Grace, told reporters in Lyon, France, that before her husband had vanished on a trip to China, he had sent her a phone message with an emoji of a knife.She interpreted the knife image to mean \u201che is in danger,\u201d she said in a brief statement to reporters on Sunday in Lyon, where the two were living and where Interpol is headquartered.Ms. Meng gave her statement at a hotel, keeping her back to reporters so that her face would not be captured on camera, a precaution that she said was for security reasons for herself and her children.She said she had received the message with the knife image shortly after Mr. Meng arrived in China. It came just four minutes after she received a message from him saying, \u201cWait for my call,\u201d she said.She has not heard from him since. She reported his disappearance to the French police on Oct. 4. A French police investigation is now underway, with the authorities saying that he had boarded a plane and arrived in China, but that his subsequent whereabouts was unknown.In addition to serving as president of the international crime-fighting body, Mr. Meng is also a vice minister in the Chinese Ministry of Public Security.The central commission can detain party officials for months or years while carrying out an investigation. The commission often concludes an investigation by stripping an official of party membership, stating the official\u2019s violations of party regulations and referring the official to the justice system for criminal prosecution.Since Mr. Xi took power as president of China, the commission has gone on a wide-ranging anticorruption campaign that has touched every level of the party.His detention means that internal party dynamics supersede any concern from the party about international legitimacy or transparency.The party\u2019s moves in this case \u201csuggest that the domestic considerations outweighed the international ones,\u201d said Mr. Ku, the law professor. \u201cThis has always been true for China, but perhaps not so obviously true as in this case.\u201dIt is unclear what led to Mr. Meng\u2019s apparent downfall \u2014 a power struggle within the party or an actual case of corruption that officials deemed to be beyond the pale.\u201cWhat I find most interesting about Meng Hongwei\u2019s detention,\u201d said Elizabeth Economy, director of Asia studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, \u201cis the continued parade of senior officials being arrested.\u201dWith officials appointed by Mr. Xi himself now being caught up in the six-year anticorruption drive, \u201cit raises the question of whether Xi Jinping simply has a very thin bench of clean officials from whom to choose, whether these officials were adequately vetted before being promoted or whether the anticorruption campaign is simply failing to deter officials from continued corrupt behaviors,\u201d Ms. Economy said. \u201cWhatever the reason, it doesn\u2019t bode well for the party\u2019s ability, ultimately, to police itself.\u201dMargaret Lewis, a professor of Chinese and Taiwanese law at Seton Hall University Law School, said Mr. Meng\u2019s detention sends a signal that \u201cno one is safe,\u201d and it could give other Chinese officials posted abroad \u201cpause when considering their own travel plans.\u201dMr. Meng was last seen leaving Interpol headquarters in Lyon on Sept. 29 for his trip to China. His wife and children had moved with him to Lyon after his appointment.Under the terms of Interpol\u2019s Constitution, the acting senior vice president, Kim Jong-yang of South Korea, becomes acting president.At her news conference on Sunday, Ms. Meng said she had decided to speak publicly because she felt it was her responsibility to do so. Her step was extraordinary: Family members of Chinese officials in trouble with the party or government usually do not make a plea for international help.\u201cFrom now on, I have gone from sorrow and fear to the pursuit of truth, justice and responsibility toward history,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the husband whom I deeply love, for my young children, for the people of my motherland, for all the wives and children, so that their husbands and fathers will no longer disappear.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Arms and the Very Bad Men", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump\u2019s rationale for going easy on Saudi Arabia is a shameful lie.Opinion ColumnistO.K., it\u2019s not news that the religious right has prostrated itself at Donald Trump\u2019s feet. But Trump\u2019s attempt to head off retaliation for Saudi crimes by claiming that there are big economic rewards to staying friendly with killers \u2014 and the willingness of his political allies to embrace his logic \u2014 nonetheless represents a new stage in the debasement of America.That said, the claims are, in fact, false.Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that under current conditions, increasing exports, even if you can do it, won\u2019t create net additional jobs for the U.S. economy. Why? Because the Federal Reserve believes that we\u2019re at full employment, and any further strengthening of the economy will induce the Fed to raise interest rates. As a result, jobs added in one place by things like arms sales will be offset by jobs lost elsewhere as higher rates deter investment or make the U.S. less competitive by strengthening the dollar.But let\u2019s get real: Trump isn\u2019t going easy on the Saudis because of the jobs they provide to defense workers. His ever-inflating count of how many jobs are involved is in itself a dead giveaway that arms sales are an excuse, not a real motive, for his actions. So what\u2019s the real reason he\u2019s so willing to forgive torture and murder?So, as I said, what we\u2019re looking at here is another step in the debasement of our nation. Accepting torture and murder is a betrayal of American principles; trying to justify that betrayal by appealing to supposed economic benefits is a further betrayal. And when you add in the fact that the claimed economic payoff is a lie, and that the president\u2019s personal profit is a much more likely explanation for his actions \u2014 well, genuine patriots should be deeply ashamed of what we\u2019ve come to as a nation.Advertisement"}

It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L.

{"Headline": "Why Trump Is Absent From His Own TV Ad", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump\u2019s closing election-season argument is to white suburban women, so he can\u2019t be the one to make it. That\u2019s because Mr. Trump is unpopular with the group of voters his campaign is apparently trying to target at this critical stage in the race: white, college-educated women, who recent polls have shown disproportionately view him negatively, and are also disinclined to vote for Republicans.The gauzy, 60-second ad features a professional white woman who appears to live in the suburbs, reflecting on the strength of the economy and fretting that \u201cthis could all go away\u201d as she hesitates, then casts a ballot for a Republican. Here\u2019s the ad:And here are the ways \u2014 some of them misleading \u2014 that the Trump campaign is targeting white suburban women.The ad opens with a woman getting her young daughter ready for school, as her television is tuned to a cable news report showing that the unemployment rate has fallen to 3.8 percent, its lowest point in 18 years. The clip is from a report aired on CNN, the network the president frequently denounces as \u201cFake News,\u201d but you wouldn\u2019t know it from this ad. The \u201cCNN\u201d bug that appears in the corner of the screen during newscasts is whited out and blank.Viewers are next reminded of worse economic times, when joblessness soared as the reverberations of the financial crisis rippled through the economy. A map of the United States with an illustration of an unemployment line on one side and a giant 9.7 percent next to an arrow bouncing upward recalls the dark days of January 2010 and suggests that joblessness was rising. There is no mention of the fact that the rate fell precipitously over the subsequent months and years, ending at 4.7 percent when President Barack Obama left office.The ad is punctuated with images that speak to the financial considerations that drive middle-class families\u2019 lives, such as the ability to afford a home \u2014 or maybe purchase a bigger one \u2014 or pay for a child\u2019s music lessons. In the beginning, a tidy home is shown with an American flag in front and a \u201cFor Sale\u201d sign on the lawn. Later, the woman is seen with her family toting boxes into a larger house marked with a \u201cSOLD\u201d sign. Throughout the commercial, the daughter is seen practicing her violin, and at the end, the scene flashes forward several years to show her performing onstage to loud applause. All, the message seems to be, because Mom voted Republican in 2018. \u201cLook, we can\u2019t get distracted from the biggest issue, which are jobs and our kids\u2019 future,\u201d the woman hears a man say on the radio as she drives past a sign in her well-manicured neighborhood that says \u201cVote Republican.\u201d (No, there is no actual name of any candidate on the sign, which is the case for exactly zero percent of political signs one week before Election Day.) The statement almost seems like a plea for voters to discard the kind of political division that Mr. Trump relishes in favor of more practical concerns. This is the closing argument section of the ad, in which the woman arrives at her polling place and \u2014 about to fill in her ballot by hand \u2014 reflects for a moment on whom she should choose. She hesitates, an apparent nod to the fact that many voters are torn, as the narrator reminds her what is at stake. \u201cThis could all go away,\u201d a voice intones, \u201cif we don\u2019t remember what we came from.\u201dWhen she makes her choice for the fictional Republican candidate, the woman fills in the bubble for \u201cTamara Tucker,\u201d rather than the Democratic name below, \u201cWilliam Cody.\u201d Republicans are just like you, the advertisement is telling women, so vote for them.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "A Guide to Trump\u2019s Stump Speeches for the Midterm Campaigns", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBe it \u201copen borders,\u201d Medicare, Veterans Choice or job creation, President Trump has recycled these 10 inaccurate talking points at more than 20 campaign rallies for Republican candidates. We fact-checked them. As he traverses the United States for election rallies before the midterm vote on Nov. 6, key details of President Trump\u2019s stump speech have seemed all too familiar: the chants, the red hats, the anecdotes, the fond recounting of his own election victory \u2014 and the falsehoods. Yes, Mr. Trump often speaks off script. But even the famously spontaneous president has stuck largely to the same rhetorical path he has trod in earlier political speeches, embellishments notwithstanding. A fact-check of multiple \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d rallies has revealed at least 10 central and inaccurate points that Mr. Trump routinely reaches for when urging people to support Republican candidates in the midterm elections. As the president intensifies his campaigning this month, here\u2019s a guide. Oct. 9, Council Bluffs, Iowa\u201cThe Democrat agenda is radical socialism and open borders. The new platform of the Democrat Party is to abolish ICE.\u201d Mr. Trump claims to have direct evidence of this Democratic strategy. On Saturday, at a rally in Topeka, Kan., he cited legislation \u201ccalled the Open Borders Bill,\u201d which he said was written by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California and supported by every other Democratic senator.Mr. Trump, however, has reduced these criticisms to a nonsensical claim. The bill does not prevent deportations, as he has said, nor does it halt prosecution of migrants for illegally entering the country. It also does not prevent family members from being detained together.Sept. 21, Springfield, MO.\u201cRepublicans want to protect Medicare. Democrats want to raid Medicare to pay their socialism.\u201dThe financial outlook for Medicare, the health care program for older Americans, has worsened under Mr. Trump\u2019s watch, in part because of his tax law.His claim about the Democrats\u2019 strategy refers to \u2014 and distorts \u2014 progressive proposals to expand \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d None of the \u201cMedicare for all\u201d bills offered by Democratic lawmakers would reduce benefits or cut dollars from the insurance program; in fact, current beneficiaries would receive more health coverage for lower costs.Oct. 4, Rochester, Minn. \u201cWe will always protect Americans with pre-existing conditions. We\u2019re going to take care of them. Some of the Democrats have been talking about ending pre-existing conditions.\u201d Mr. Trump\u2019s promise to \u201calways protect\u201d Americans who have pre-existing medical conditions contradicts actions that have been taken by his own administration and political party. Oct. 9, Council Bluffs, Iowa\u201cWe won't talk about Da Nang Dick, who tried to convince people for 15 years that he was a great war hero. They were going down left. They were going down right. Right, you know who that is? [Senator Richard] Blumenthal. He said they were going on my left, they were going down, he was in Da Nang Province. Except the one problem. It's hard to be there, because he was never in Vietnam. But these are minor details.\u201dEven before Mr. Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, became a vocal opponent of confirming Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, the lawmaker was the subject of embellished attacks from Mr. Trump.Oct. 1, Johnson City, Tenn.\u201cNo more Nafta. It\u2019s the largest trade deal the United States has ever negotiated.\u201d In July, the European Union struck a trade agreement with Japan, covering a third of the global economy and 40 percent of international trade. Trade in the European Union itself totaled about $4 trillion in 2017.Trade talks that culminated in 1994 and created the World Trade Organization involved 123 countries that accounted for 90 percent of international trade. It now includes more than 160 economies and affects nearly all global trade.Oct. 4, Rochester, Minn. \u201cSince the election, we have created over four million new jobs. The media will tell you there was no way we could have said that during the campaign. Nobody would have believed it.\u201dIn the 22 months from December 2016 to September 2018, the economy added over 4.2 million jobs. In the 22 months before Mr. Trump\u2019s election, the economy added 4.7 million jobs.Aug. 4, Lewis Center, Ohio\u201cRepublicans passed the biggest tax cuts in reform in American history.\u201dOct. 2, Southaven, Miss. \u201cWe also passed Veterans Choice. Forty-four years they tried to do it.\u201dMr. Trump enacted changes this summer to a health care program for veterans, but the program itself has existed since 2014. In June, Mr. Trump consolidated that and other existing programs, and expanded eligibility requirements.Sept. 6, Billings, Mont.\u201cWe\u2019ve started the wall. Everybody wants the wall. We\u2019ve spent $3.2 billion on the wall.\u201d A March spending bill signed by Mr. Trump allotted $1.6 billion for projects to replace old along the border barriers with new barriers. But that bill did not allow spending funds on a new border wall.Sept. 29, Wheeling, W.Va. \u201cWe have a pipeline of some of the greatest products, and we couldn\u2019t get them. We couldn\u2019t use them. Person\u2019s going to die in four months. We couldn\u2019t use them. For 45 years, they\u2019ve been trying to get this passed. Not that easy. Not that easy. I got it passed. Right to Try.\u201dIt is false that patients \u201ccouldn\u2019t use\u201d these drugs before the May law. A program known as compassionate use, or expanded access, has been in place since the 1970s. It allows patients with a serious disease or condition to obtain experimental medicines; the F.D.A. says it authorizes 99 percent of the requests for expanded access that it receives.The new law allows doctors and patients to directly ask drug companies for access rather than go through the government.An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of a Mississippi town where President Trump held a rally on Oct. 2. It is Southaven, not South Haven.Advertisement"}

But that expenditure actually fell as a percentage of the overall (and rapidly growing) economy.Corporate tax revenues have fallen by a third from a comparable period a year ago, a direct consequence of the tax law signed last year, which reduced the top corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.For the full 2018 fiscal year, corporate tax receipts were nearly $205 billion. That figure is a drop from $297 billion in fiscal year 2017.And because the tax law change didn\u2019t take effect until January, its full effect won\u2019t be known until the 2019 fiscal year.At a conference yesterday celebrating Wired magazine\u2019s 25th anniversary, two of the biggest names in tech addressed some of their divisive business strategies:More from Paul Mozur of the NYT:The military exploited Facebook\u2019s wide reach in Myanmar, where it is so broadly used that many of the country\u2019s 18 million internet users confuse the Silicon Valley social media platform with the internet.

He and Mr. Gates tweaked and massaged the code, and it became the operating system that guided the IBM personal computer, introduced in 1981.

{"Headline": "Saudi Arabia Has No Leverage", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIgnore the bluster from Riyadh. The Saudi economy is dependent on the U.S., which has plenty of power to force concessions. Ms. Wald is the author of \u201cSaudi, Inc.: The Arabian Kingdom\u2019s Pursuit of Profit and Power.\u201dThe shadow of a Saudi trader is seen on a stock market monitor in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.As the fallout continues over the disappearance of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, the government in Riyadh is putting on a tough face. If there are sanctions over the alleged murder of Mr. Khashoggi, the Saudis want the world to know, they will fight back.These are empty threats. Saudi Arabia is not in a position to harm the United States. In fact, when it comes to relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia, Washington has all of the leverage. American policymakers shouldn\u2019t forget that.All of this is at risk if the dispute worsens between Saudi Arabia and the United States over Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. Not only could the Saudis not retaliate because their economy is so intertwined with that of the United States, but they will also be susceptible to pressure. Targeted sanctions \u2014 if it comes to that \u2014 could force consultants to withdraw or cut off the Saudi Public Investment Fund\u2019s access to the profits of its investments. More likely, though, is that a continuing dispute would force American businesses like AMC to seriously reconsider involvement in the country because of negative publicity.What about oil? Whereas Saudi Arabia could once shock the world economy by cutting oil exports or production to raise prices, it no longer has that power. The oil market today is significantly more diverse than it was in 1973, when Saudi Arabia and other Arab petroleum exporters unilaterally raised the price of oil and unsettled the American economy. In fact, the United States now produces more oil than Saudi Arabia, and imports make up a smaller percentage of domestically refined crude oil.The Saudis are dependent on the United States, and public opinion is increasingly against them. Already, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has backed out of a high profile finance conference in Riyadh next week. Mr. Trump could use this as a chance to pressure Riyadh to come around on some of his real priorities: the peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians that Jared Kushner is trying to broker; a resolution to the dispute with Qatar, which hosts a critical American military base; billions of dollars more in purchases from American industries.Saudi Arabia is not in a position to threaten the American economy. In fact, the kingdom may be overestimating its own economic clout. It would be a mistake for Riyadh to try to act on its threats against the United States.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump and G.O.P. Candidates Escalate Race and Fear as Election Ploys", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump on Monday sharply intensified a Republican campaign to frame the midterm elections as a battle over immigration and race, issuing a dark and factually baseless warning that \u201cunknown Middle Easterners\u201d were marching toward the American border with Mexico.The unsubstantiated charge marked an escalation of Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to stoke fears about foreigners and crime ahead of the Nov. 6 vote, as he did to great effect in the presidential race. Mr. Trump and other Republicans are insistently seeking to tie Democrats to unfettered immigration and violent crime, and in some instances this summer and fall they have attacked minority candidates in nakedly racial terms.\u201cThat is an assault on our country and in that caravan you have some very bad people and we can\u2019t let that happen to our country,\u201d the president said at a rally in Houston on Monday night. Mr. Trump suggested without any proof that the opposition was involved in instigating the caravan. \u201cI think the Democrats had something to do with it,\u201d he said.In targeting the caravan, the president appears determined to end the election season with a cultural fight over national identity rather than the issues that party leaders initially wanted to run on, like tax cuts or the economy.But Mr. Trump has not been alone in seeking to divide the electorate along racial lines this fall: As the congressional elections have approached, a number of Republican candidates and political committees have delivered messages plainly aimed at stoking cultural anxiety among white voters and even appealing to overt racism.The approach taken by Mr. Trump and like-minded Republicans contrasts starkly with the way Democrats have campaigned in 2018, and with how Republican congressional leaders had originally vowed to approach the midterms. Democratic candidates have tended to downplay immigration as a theme, focusing instead on a small number of kitchen-table issues, chiefly health care.After a campaign stop in Florida on Monday, Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president who is mulling a run for the presidency in 2020, criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s ferocity on the migrant issue.\u201cThe caravan is 2,000 miles away. He\u2019s making it sound like they\u2019re breaking through the border. This is hysteria on his part. Let it calm down,\u201d Mr. Biden said.When asked whether Republicans were trying to win the midterms with racial appeals, Mr. Biden shot back, \u201cThey are because that\u2019s who they are.\u201dNewt Gingrich, the former House speaker and occasional Trump adviser, said immigration could be a more potent issue than the economy. \u201cThe caravan is an existential moment,\u201d he said.Citing polls showing a strong majority of the country opposes illegal immigration, Mr. Gingrich argued, \u201cThat\u2019s a lot bigger margin than you\u2019re going to get in the near future on Trump\u2019s economic policy.\u201dAli Noorani, head of the National Immigration Forum, a nonpartisan advocacy group that favors comprehensive immigration reform, said there was little surprise that Mr. Trump would ultimately steer Republicans this way, rather than focusing on economic themes.\u201cWe fully expected the president to place a big bet on an anti-immigrant message as we got closer and closer to the midterms,\u201d Mr. Noorani said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a surprise, it\u2019s that he\u2019s not talking about Kavanaugh or the economy as much as I expected.\u201dBut Mr. Noorani said Republicans face a trade-off: \u201cIs that going to be a message that turns off independent voters?\u201dMuch of the harshest advertising around immigration and race has come in conservative-leaning, relatively homogeneous districts where Republican incumbents are gravely endangered. For lawmakers like Mr. Collins and Representative John Faso of New York, who faces Mr. Delgado, the most likely chance for re-election depends on the strong support of conservative whites.Mr. Delgado said in an interview on Monday that he did not believe voters would accept what he described as Republicans\u2019 \u201cgrotesque misrepresentation\u201d of his biography and beliefs. He acknowledged that the crude negativity of the attacks came as a shock.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this,\u201d Mr. Delgado said. \u201cI think this is divisive, and this is ugly, and I think it has no place in our politics.\u201dPolls suggest close races in the districts held by Mr. Faso and Mr. Collins, as well as the Dallas-area seat where Mr. Allred is running against Representative Pete Sessions.Mr. Trump and other Republicans hope that the image of thousands of migrants seeking to enter the country will further energize his political base, which is predominantly made up of lower-income white voters who are generally suspicious of immigration.Stephen K. Bannon, the immigration hard-liner who advised Mr. Trump in the White House, said Republicans were nationalizing the midterm election around themes that electrify the right. Mr. Bannon likened it to the end of the 2016 election, when Mr. Trump \u201ccame alive in the last few weeks of that campaign, and closed hard.\u201dRight now, Mr. Bannon said, \u201cTrump\u2019s grass-roots base is united and on fire.\u201dJustin Fairfax, Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor, who won a landslide victory in 2017 to become the state\u2019s second-ever black constitutional officer, said Republicans there had attempted to walk a \u201cvery dark political road,\u201d as Mr. Trump is doing now.\u201cAmericans are rejecting that dark vision,\u201d said Mr. Fairfax, a Democrat, adding, \u201cWhat we showed in Virginia is, not only would they lose, but they would lose in historic proportions.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.In Nevada on Monday, former President Barack Obama alluded at an early-voting rally to the Republican campaign, telling Democrats that the G.O.P. would be trying to \u201cappeal to tribe\u201d and \u201cpit one group against the other\u201d over the next two weeks. But there was little expectation among voters there that Mr. Trump might change course.\u201cThis is what they do,\u201d said Reese Williams, a 49-year-old veteran, of Mr. Trump\u2019s party. \u201cThese are the cards they pull all the time.\u201dBut Mr. Trump\u2019s dystopian imagery has clearly left an impression with some. Carol Shields, 75, a Republican in northern Minnesota, said she was afraid that migrant gangs could take over people\u2019s summer lake homes in the state.\u201cWhat\u2019s to stop them?\u201d said Ms. Shields, a retired accountant. \u201cWe have a lot of people who live on lakes in the summer and winter someplace else. When they come back in the spring, their house would be occupied.\u201dAlexander Burns reported from New York and Astead W. Herndon from Las Vegas. Peter Baker, Jeremy W.

{"Headline": "\u2018You Are Still Black\u2019: Charlottesville\u2019s Racial Divide Hinders Students", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byZyahna Bryant and Trinity Hughes, high school seniors, have been friends since they were 6, raised by blue-collar families in this affluent college town. They played on the same T-ball and softball teams, and were in the same church group.But like many African-American children in Charlottesville, Trinity lived on the south side of town and went to a predominantly black neighborhood elementary school. Zyahna lived across the train tracks, on the north side, and was zoned to a mostly white school, near the University of Virginia campus, that boasts the city\u2019s highest reading scores.In elementary school, Zyahna was chosen for the district\u2019s program for gifted students. Since then, she has completed more than a dozen advanced-placement and college-level courses, maintained a nearly 4.0 grade-point average, and has been a student leader and a community activist. She has her eyes set on a prestigious university like UVA.\u201cI want to go somewhere where it shows how much hard work I\u2019ve put in,\u201d Zyahna said.Trinity was not selected for the gifted program. She tried to enroll in higher-level courses and was denied. She expects to graduate this school year, but with a transcript that she says will not make her competitive for selective four-year colleges.\u201cI know what I\u2019m capable of, and what I can do,\u201d Trinity said, \u201cbut the counselors and teachers, they don\u2019t really care about that.\u201dRailroad tracks divide the city into three predominantly white elementary school zones to the north, and three mostly black schools to the south.GreenbrierElementaryCharlottesville Black population above city averageVenableElementaryBurnley-MoranElementaryNorfolk Southern and CSX RailroadsClarkElementaryJohnson ElementaryJackson-ViaElementaryHALF A MILEGreenbrierElementaryBlack population above city averageCharlottesville VenableElementaryBurnley-MoranElementaryNorfolk Southern and CSX RailroadsClarkElementaryJohnson ElementaryJackson-ViaElementaryHALF A MILEBlack population above city averageGreenbrierElementaryCharlottesville VenableElementaryBurnley-MoranElementaryJohnson ElementaryClarkElementaryJackson-ViaElementaryNorfolk Southern and CSX RailroadsSource: School zone boundaries from the City of Charlottesville, Black population from the Census Bureau | The New York TimesFor every student like Zyahna in Charlottesville\u2019s schools, there are scores like Trinity, caught in one of the widest educational disparities in the United States. Charlottesville\u2019s racial inequities mirror college towns across the country, including Berkeley, Calif., and Evanston, Ill. But they also match the wider world of education, which is grappling with racial gaps \u2014 in areas including gifted programs and school discipline \u2014 that can undercut the effort to equitably prepare students for college in a competitive economy.Charlottesville is \u201cbeautiful physically and aesthetically pleasing, but a very ugly-in-the-soul place,\u201d said Nikuyah Walker, who became its first black female mayor during the self-recrimination that swept the city after last year\u2019s white nationalist rallies. \u201cNo one has ever attempted to undo that, and that affects whether our children can learn here.\u201dToday, white students make up 40 percent of Charlottesville\u2019s enrollment, and African-American students about a third. But white children are about four times as likely to be in Charlottesville\u2019s gifted program, while black students are more than four times as likely to be held back a grade and almost five times as likely to be suspended from school, according to a ProPublica/New York Times examination of newly available district and federal data.Since 2005, the academic gulf between white and black students in Charlottesville has widened in nearly all subjects, including reading, writing, history and science. As of last year, half of all black students in Charlottesville could not read at grade level, compared with only a tenth of white students, according to state data. Black students in Charlottesville lag on average about three and a half grades behind their white peers in reading and math, compared with a national gap of about two grades.Over the decades, school board members have often brushed aside findings of racial inequality in Charlottesville schools, including a 2004 audit \u2014 commissioned by the district\u2019s first African-American superintendent \u2014 that blamed inadequate leadership and a history of racism for the persistent underachievement of its black students.Officials in the 4,500-student district \u2014 which spends about $16,000 per pupil, one of the highest rates in the state \u2014 instead point to socioeconomic differences. The vast majority of Charlottesville\u2019s black children qualify for free or reduced-price meals at school because of low family income.District leaders say they are tackling the achievement gap with initiatives such as eliminating prerequisites for advanced classes. Besides, they say, test scores are only one measure of success.\u201cI\u2019m not trying to make excuses\u201d for the test scores of black students, said Rosa Atkins, the district\u2019s superintendent for almost 13 years, \u201cbut that\u2019s only one measure of where they are, and who they are, and their capabilities for success.\u201dIn such communities, \u201cdisparities in resources \u2014 between white and black students, for example \u2014 may be more consequential,\u201d he said.Dr. Atkins said that it is unfair to compare black students with white classmates who attended the best preschools and have traveled abroad. \u201cThe experiences that they bring into our school system are very different,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we start saying that until you start performing like white children, you have a deficit, I think that in itself is discrimination.\u201dStill, socioeconomics do not fully explain the gap. State exam data shows that, among Charlottesville children from low-income families, white students outperformed black students in all subjects over the past three years. The same pattern holds true for wealthier students.And in the past year, even the city\u2019s immigrant students who are learning English have outperformed black students on state exams in every subject.Dr. Atkins said that what does not show up in test scores is how far behind black children start, and how they sometimes have to acquire two years\u2019 worth of skills in just one year.\u201cI dare say that our black children are performing better than our white children\u201d when their progress is considered, she said. \u201cThat tells me that our children have resilience, tenacity and ability far superior than what we\u2019re giving them credit for.\u201dAmong white parents, last year\u2019s rallies have fostered more frank discussions of racial inequality, said one of the parents, Guian McKee, an associate professor at the University of Virginia. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot more openness to some of those challenging conversations,\u201d he said.At their predominantly black elementary school, Mr. McKee\u2019s two children participated in the gifted program, which is about three-quarters white. Such disparities, at odds with Charlottesville\u2019s reputation as a bastion of Southern progressivism, have long been a taboo topic, he said.\u201cFor a lot of people, it\u2019s really uncomfortable to see that even if you haven\u2019t personally done anything wrong,\u201d Mr. McKee said, \u201cyou\u2019re part of larger structures that contribute to producing poverty and inequality, including in educational outcomes.\u201dMuch like its Confederate past, Charlottesville\u2019s history of school segregation weighs heavily on the present day. \u201cI don\u2019t think the hate groups selected our community by chance,\u201d Dr. Atkins said.Charlottesville greeted the Supreme Court\u2019s 1954 Brown v. Board of Education desegregation decision with a firm no. In 1958, Gov. J. Lindsay Almond of Virginia ordered the city to shut down two white-serving public schools rather than integrate.But the city\u2019s resistance to integration persisted. Instead of outright segregation, the white-led district established testing requirements solely for black students who tried to enroll in historically white schools. It also allowed white students who lived in attendance zones of historically black schools to transfer back to predominantly white schools. Black students who lived near mostly white schools were assigned to black schools.Two years later, the board considered redrawing school zones to bolster racial and economic equity, but worried about white flight. In the end, elementary school boundaries were largely left alone. The district pooled the city\u2019s middle school students into two schools, one serving all fifth and sixth graders, and the other serving all seventh and eighth graders. The number of white students declined about 20 percent within a decade.Other efforts to reshape attendance zones faced resistance. In 2003, a group of predominantly black families asked to send 20 of their children to Venable Elementary School, one of the historically white schools that had once closed rather than integrate.Venable, which Zyahna would later attend, has the highest reading proficiency of all of the elementary schools in the city. The black families lived several blocks from Venable, and they had grown frustrated by their children\u2019s long commutes to their zoned school. But when the school board proposed reassigning the 20 children, white parents from Venable \u201cfreaked,\u201d said Dede Smith, then a board member.\u201cWe only put our toe in the water,\u201d she said.\u201cWhile some members of the community might wish for an elongated period of time to ponder and debate changes, the children are in school only once and then they are gone,\u201d the audit concluded. \u201cNo city can survive by only serving one-half its constituents well. The future of such a legacy is dire.\u201dThe auditors pushed for increasing black students\u2019 access to high-level academic programs, including gifted and advanced-placement courses.Today, Ms. Galvin largely stands by that position. \u201cA \u2018too narrow and racially biased\u2019 focus on the schools does a disservice to the dedicated educators who have made a difference and risks misdiagnosing a complex problem, leading to ineffective solutions,\u201d she said.Dr. Atkins said she has incorporated some of the audit\u2019s recommendations, such as data-driven decision-making and a reorganization of central office staff, into the district\u2019s strategic plan.To black families, segregation had returned by another name.When students are selected for Quest, they are pulled out of their regular classrooms for enrichment sessions in academics and arts with a specialized teacher in a designated classroom.\u201cWhen people bring up Quest, we get angry,\u201d Trinity said. \u201cWe all wish we had the opportunity to have that separate creative time. It drives a gap between students from elementary school on.\u201dFor children who read below grade level, the city offers a supplemental program called Extending the Bridges of Literacy. But the program takes place after school, and it is taught by instructors who volunteer to extend their workday for extra pay, regardless of whether they have specialized intervention training.Racial inequities persist into the high school\u2019s advanced-placement courses, which provide students with college credits. White students in Charlottesville are nearly six times as likely to be in advanced courses as their black peers, according to recently released federal data.\u201cThere is an incentive to segregate these kids,\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the schools see anything positive in an academic mixing pot because the white parents will leave.\u201dIn the past two years, Charlottesville High administrators have introduced staff training on racial inequalities. Teachers have participated in professional development that included studying \u201cequity-based teaching\u201d; lessons in Charlottesville\u2019s local black history and Civil War history; and workshops on implicit bias. The school\u2019s principal also set up focus groups and surveyed high-performing black students about underrepresentation in advanced courses.Dr. Atkins, the school district\u2019s superintendent, has introduced other initiatives aimed at reducing the achievement gap. Besides abolishing prerequisites for advanced courses, she created a \u201cmatrix\u201d that families could follow to map out a sequence of coursework. She has also tried to remedy the underrepresentation of minorities and girls in science electives by giving every middle schooler an opportunity to take an engineering course.The district, meanwhile, expanded what it calls \u201chonors option\u201d courses, in which students can choose to meet requirements for regular or honors credit.Jennifer Horne, an English teacher at Charlottesville High School, called her honors option course \u201cthe most beautiful place in the building.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve got struggling readers, and kids who are way smarter than me in the same room,\u201d she said.Ms. Horne added that she is able to pose the \u201cbig questions,\u201d which are usually reserved for advanced courses, and identify students with untapped potential.With the help of a scholarship, Zyahna attended preschool through part of first grade at an elite private school. Her preparation helped her to pass an admission test for the gifted program after she entered Venable. As she got older, church members who worked in the schools advised her on the programs and classes she needed to stay on pace with her white peers.Zyahna felt isolated in the sea of white faces. She became an activist, founding the Black Student Union, petitioning the City Council to remove the Lee statue and speaking out at school board meetings about the achievement gap. \u201cIt has caused me to become even more of an advocate for people of color, just for my blackness, because you enter into this whole sunken place when you get into honors and A.P. courses,\u201d she said.Zyahna likened her high school experience to shopping because students have to scout out the best deals. \u201cYou literally have to go ask for everything yourself,\u201d she said, \u201cand not everyone has those skills or confidence.\u201dTrinity said she lost that confidence as teachers repeatedly rejected her requests to enroll in higher-level courses. She tried to take Algebra II her junior year, an essential course for many colleges. Trinity had struggled early in a geometry course, but had stayed after school, sought tutoring and earned a B. She figured that she could work just as hard in Algebra II, but her geometry teacher would not allow it, Trinity said.The teacher declined to comment on individual students. School officials said that a student\u2019s performance in geometry is not the only factor in a teacher\u2019s recommendation for Algebra II.Trinity\u2019s mother, Valarie Walker, fought for Trinity to take higher-level courses, but school personnel did not \u201cwant to listen to what the black kids have to say,\u201d she said.\u201cI don\u2019t think our voices were as strong as they needed to be,\u201d Ms. Walker said. \u201cThey kept saying, \u2018This would be better.\u2019 I think we gave up fighting.\u201dIn Charlottesville\u2019s schools, the mantra is, \u201cGraduate by any means necessary.\u201d Bring up anything else \u2014 test scores, suspension rates \u2014 and Dr. Atkins counters, \u201cWe prefer to focus on the long-term goals, and the long-term goal is graduation.\u201dDr. Atkins acknowledged that some minority students may be discouraged from taking higher-level courses that could qualify them for better colleges and said that the district will remind parents to bring these rebuffs to her attention. Mayor Walker, whose son is a sophomore at Charlottesville High, said some attitudes have not changed: \u201cThere have been a lot of people who just don\u2019t believe in the potential of our kids.\u201dSince middle school, Trinity\u2019s goal has been to attend James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Va. She has gained enough credits for an advanced diploma, but last month she learned that she would need a math class higher than Algebra II to gain admission.A university representative recommended she go to community college, then possibly transfer to James Madison. Michael Walsh, the university\u2019s dean of admissions, said that 99 percent of the students it accepts have gone beyond Algebra II.Trinity was crushed: \u201cIt made me realize I really haven\u2019t been prepared like the rest of the students to be \u2018college ready.\u2019\u201dZyahna\u2019s achievements make her a prime candidate for an elite university, so she was taken aback when, as she was beginning her search, her principal encouraged her to explore community college. The principal says the context was a broad discussion with black student leaders about community college as an affordable option.That is not how Zyahna heard it.\u201cNo matter how high your scores are or how many hours you put into your work, you are still black,\u201d Zyahna said. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole system you\u2019re up against. Every small victory just cuts a hole into that system reminding you how fragile it is. But it\u2019s still there.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Believe It or Not, Airport Bathrooms Are Getting Better (and Cleaner) ", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUpdateNew technology that draws from user feedback is helping. Those dingy, unappealing spaces \u2014 often with broken door latches, paper towel dispensers that have long ago run out of towels, and floors that look they like they are in dire need of cleaning \u2014 have often been the option of last resort for many frequent travelers.But, now, increasing numbers of airports seem to have recognized that clean bathrooms are an important aspect of travel and have begun to take steps to improve both the conditions and the monitoring of their facilities.\u201cBathroom cleanliness is a big driver of satisfaction at airports, and if you want a pleasant experience, clean bathrooms are a must,\u201d said Dimitri Coll, the associate director for the Airports Council International, the official association for the world\u2019s airports, which recently conducted a survey of travelers that emphasized the importance of airport cleanliness. There are signs travelers may be closer to getting what they want.Seven airports around the country, including Los Angeles International Airport, Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and George Bush Intercontinental Airport, in Houston, have invested in a new software system called TRAX SmartRestroom, which aims to keep bathrooms cleaner and helps move the lines to use stalls more efficiently (several more airports will introduce the system before the end of the year).First, each bathroom with the SmartRestroom has a light above the stall indicating whether it\u2019s in use: a green light means it\u2019s available while red signals occupied. The software also has a counting sensor at the entrance of the restroom that tracks when passengers walk in and leave. Each airport can pick how many people enter the restroom before an email alert is sent to its custodial supervisor indicating that it\u2019s time to clean the restroom \u2014 say, after 300 people.Ms. Davis said that airports spend from $25,000 to more than $250,000 on the SmartRestroom system, depending on the level of the installation they choose. \u201cThe system lets us respond to an issue immediately so that it won\u2019t be a problem for the following people who use the restroom. We can fix problems as they happen,\u201d said Michael Christensen, the deputy executive director for facilities maintenance and utilities for Los Angeles World Airports, which includes Los Angeles International Airport. The airport began using SmartRestroom in April in a pair of bathroom in Terminal Four. (In the coming weeks, the airport will offer the SmartRestroom in all 14 bathrooms that are in Terminal Six.)\u201cWe know that there\u2019s nothing worse than a dirty bathroom, and this app helps us make sure that ours stay clean,\u201d said Andrew Trull, a spokesman for the airports.In addition, the Port Authority, which operates the three major New York City area airports, has installed more than 450 FeedbackNow devices throughout its restrooms in the last year through which travelers can indicate whether they had a positive experience or not. The feedback is provided in real-time to terminal operators and cleaning contractors, who can deploy staff to inspect the restrooms. According to Cheryl Albiez, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority, these devices have collected more than two million votes and have resulted in several million dollars of investment to make the bathrooms cleaner.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why \u2018Green\u2019 Germany Remains Addicted to Coal", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCOTTBUS, Germany \u2014 On a Sunday in September, at the moment when part of the nearby coal-fired power station went dark for good, 600 people lifted white miner\u2019s helmets from their heads and placed them on folding chairs in the main square in Cottbus, an industrial town in eastern Germany.It was a silent protest to mark the number of jobs lost.\u201cYou have to think that every one of those places represents a job, an income that an entire family depends on,\u201d said Mathias Felsch, a 26-year-old whose father and grandfather both worked in the coal mines. \u201cWhen you see it like that, it really is a whole lot.\u201dEven so, for Germany, it is not nearly enough.If the country is to meet its commitment to the Paris Climate Accord \u2014 to reduce carbon emissions by 80 to 95 percent by 2050 \u2014 it must also address the economic and social impact on the roughly 22,500 people whose jobs depend on coal.Increasingly, for Chancellor Angela Merkel it is a question of wavering political will in the face of mounting challenges, including from the far right, in eastern regions where a bulk of those jobs would be lost.\u201cIn the past Chancellor Merkel has been seen as the \u2018climate chancellor,\u2019 riding on the wave of renewable energy successes,\u201d said Jennifer Morgan, a director of Greenpeace International. \u201cBut unless she turns her full attention to reducing emissions in Germany, particularly from coal, with clear support for a phaseout of coal by 2030, her legacy will not be green. It will be dirty brown.\u201dToday, nearly a quarter of all electricity produced in Germany still comes from burning lignite, often called brown coal, one of the dirtiest fossil fuels, making Germany the world\u2019s leader in the mining and burning of lignite, according to the International Energy Agency.For Ms. Merkel, the news could not have come at a worse time. Already, in August, the environment ministry said the country will fail to meet its ambitious targets to cut carbon emissions to 40 percent of 1990 levels by 2020.The pressure to save her country\u2019s international reputation comes as Ms. Merkel faces an unexpectedly strong challenge from the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, the leading opposition party, which has questioned Germany\u2019s national consensus on the role humans play in contributing to climate change.The party is particularly strong in three of the eastern states where mining regions sit, where the economy is among the weakest, and where sensitivities run deep over a history of economic displacement since reunification of the country in the 1990s.\u201cPeople here remember the trauma of losing nine out of 10 jobs with the changes that happened after the collapse of communism,\u201d said Philipp Zirzow, a leader of the union representing local coal workers. \u201cNow they are supposed to experience that all over again.\u201dMr. Zirzow helped organize the miners\u2019 protest in front of city hall in Cottbus, the capital of eastern German coal country, over the closing of Block F of J\u00e4nschwalde power station. Government promises to bring industrial jobs to replace those lost never materialized, further angering and alienating people, he said.An estimated 7,800 jobs are dependent on the mines in Lusatia, a region abutting Poland, where Cottbus is situated and memories of the 2.5 million people put out of work after the fall of the Berlin Wall remain acute. Some 1,900 jobs are at stake in another nearby mining region in eastern Germany.In addition, 8,900 people work in the country\u2019s other main mining region, in the heavily industrial state of North Rhine-Westphalia, a critical testing ground for Ms. Merkel\u2019s Christian Democratic Party.Dozens of studies published in recent years suggest a transition to renewable energy sources, while keeping the lights on and people in work, is possible. With the exception of Spain, all of Germany\u2019s western European partners have already quit coal, or are on track to do so.\u201cWe have the technology,\u201d said Jochen Flasbarth, a state secretary in Germany\u2019s ministry for the environment, who is considered a father of the country\u2019s shift to renewable energy.Germany will need to expand its power grid to help carry electricity generated by turbines in the windy northern states to the industrial regions farther south, said Patrick Graichen, director of Agora Energiewende, a think tank focused on the shift to renewable energy.\u201cBetween now and 2030, there are still 12 years, so a government can speed up processes and get things done,\u201d Mr. Graichen said.The situation in the former East Germany is especially difficult. Creating jobs there would require attracting new investors to the region which, despite being only 80 miles east of Berlin, has only a single-track railway connecting it to the capital and little industry beyond lignite.One of the biggest employers is LEAG, which owns and operates several mines and power plants, providing 8,000 jobs.Hanna Buchmann and Nora Gundermann, both 18, started traineeships there in August and believe the company can offer them a future.\u201cLEAG offered the best opportunities and the best pay. They are really the only company here in the region,\u201d said Ms. Buchmann, who took part in the demonstration in Cottbus.The events threatened to derail the commission\u2019s work, after representatives from environmental groups threatened to quit the body unless RWE halted the clearing. The power company refused, until a court ordered it to suspend the plans pending a further ruling, not expected before 2020.While the company warned of \u201cfar-reaching ramifications,\u201d environmental activists celebrated the ruling as a first step in the difficult decision of how to wean Germany off its most significant and abundant fossil fuel.\u201cHambach has become a symbol for the fight against coal,\u201d said Dirk Jansen, the general manager for the regional chapter of Friends of the Earth Germany, which filed the suit. \u201cThe final match for brown coal has begun.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Why Italy Could Be the Epicenter of the Next Financial Crisis", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHistory suggests that the world is about due for another financial crisis. One of the places it might start, according to a growing number of indicators, is Italy.Many of the ingredients are there. A pile of questionable debt. Weak banks. An erratic government. And a sizable economy able to inflict collateral damage outside Italian borders.Bond investors, always good for a coldblooded appraisal of a country\u2019s solvency, have been sounding the alarm. The Rome government\u2019s populist spending plans, widely regarded in financial circles as reckless, have caused market interest rates on Italian debt to spike, threatening to create a so-called doom loop that would ripple through the struggling economy.The proposed budget has exposed the seams in Italy\u2019s governing coalition, where one party favors small-business-friendly tax cuts and the other enormously expensive welfare programs. More broadly, it has divided the populist government, which has vowed to press ahead with a budget it views as a political imperative, and the Italian financial establishment, which fears what the spending will do to the country\u2019s economy and its credibility and relationship with Europe.You don\u2019t have to be Italian to be worried about the repercussions.Financial crises tend to arrive every decade or so, and Italy is near the top of a list of flash points that could touch off the next one, alongside Turkey\u2019s economic and political turmoil, President Trump\u2019s trade war, Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union and a broad slowdown in global growth.But in contrast to the financial crisis that began in 2008, central banks may not be able to come to the rescue this time, said Richard Portes, a professor of economics at London Business School. They used up much of their crisis fighting tools coping with the last meltdown.\u201cIt would be very difficult for Mario Draghi to think of another way to get out of the mess,\u201d Mr. Portes said, referring to the president of the European Central Bank.That is why investors are so worried about Italy. The eurozone is still recovering from a debt crisis that began in Greece in 2010. Italy, the currency bloc\u2019s third-largest economy, accounts for 11 percent of the European Union\u2019s gross domestic product \u2014 10 times as much as Greece \u2014 and has the potential to create far more damage.Many of the country\u2019s problems are longstanding, such as the unusually high number of problem loans on its banks\u2019 balance sheets and chronically slow growth. Italy\u2019s economy has still not made up the ground it lost after the 2008 financial crisis. The new element is Italy\u2019s populist government, which to the horror of European Union officials and bond markets is pledging money it doesn\u2019t have to fulfill campaign promises.Unlike previous Italian governments that bristled at, but ultimately complied with, demands from the European Union, Italy\u2019s populists have made their careers running against Brussels.They are pursuing a brazenly confrontational course with the European Commission, never mind the market reaction or the consequences for Italian savers, who are among the biggest holders of government bonds.\u201cThe enemies of Europe are those barricaded in the bunker of Brussels,\u201d Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant League and the country\u2019s most powerful politician, said this week in a news conference. He has repeatedly called Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission\u2019s president, and Pierre Moscovici, its economics commissioner, the villains who \u201chave ruined Europe and our country\u201d through austerity measures.Under eurozone rules, Italy must submit its budget for European Commission scrutiny by Monday. The proposed spending plan calls for a deficit equal to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product, a figure considered way too high for a country whose total government debt equals 131 percent of G.D.P., more than double the eurozone limit.The previous, center-left government had proposed a budget with a 0.8 percent deficit, which would have allowed Italy to continue chipping away at its total debt.A significant portion of the new budget would go toward a broad welfare program, a key campaign promise of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement to its young, unemployed and frustrated base, many in Italy\u2019s depressed south.\u201cIn a decisive manner, with this measure, with this budget, we will have abolished poverty,\u201d said Luigi Di Maio, the political leader of the Five Star Movement and Italy\u2019s economic development minister, in a television interview last month.In addition, the hostile tone that the Italians have taken with the European Union, the very thing that helped put them in power, \u201cindicates that the government sees political opportunities in attacking the E.U.\u2019s fiscal rules, especially in the run-up to European parliamentary elections next May,\u201d the report said.Fitch has signaled it could downgrade its rating of Italy\u2019s debt, a step that if matched by other ratings agencies would further raise the government\u2019s cost to borrow.The government has cut some expenditures, but in categories that further provoke Brussels. For example, Rome has suspended plans to acquire a new missile defense system at a time when Europe is trying to appease Mr. Trump by spending more on NATO.Officials in Brussels face a dilemma, though. They will lose credibility if they fail to discipline an errant member. But if they take too hard a line they will simply make Brussels a convenient scapegoat for Italian politicians.The Italian government, at least for now, appears popular and immune to electoral pain. When the Italian Parliament passed the budget proposal at the end of September, Mr. Di Maio and his allies in the Five Star Movement took to the balcony of the Palazzo Chigi, the seat of Italian government, and flashed victory signs as a crowd of lawmakers and supporters below them chanted, \u201cLuigi! Luigi!\u201dBut public support could begin to waver if investors continue to lose confidence in Italian debt, which would have severe consequences for the economy.Italy is still a long way from the darkest days of the eurozone debt crisis in 2011, when investors bid the market rate, or yield, on government bonds to over 7 percent. But the yield has climbed significantly since the populist government won elections this year, topping 3.7 percent this week, compared with 1.7 percent in May.Italian banks like UniCredit have large holdings of their home country\u2019s debt. When yields rise, the value of their bond holdings goes down, eroding their capital and raising questions about their health. UniCredit shares have slumped to about 12 euros recently from \u20ac18 in April.In an effort to preserve capital, banks then become more cautious about lending. Consumers and businesses have to pay higher interest rates to borrow, or might not be able to get credit at all, strangling the economy.If economic growth slows and unemployment rises, fewer people pay taxes and the government\u2019s financial situation deteriorates further. Investors then insist on a higher risk premium on Italian bonds \u2014 a higher return \u2014 and the cycle repeats. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a doom loop.\u201cDebt is the great multiplier of turbulence for Italy,\u201d Luigi Federico Signorini, the deputy director general of the Bank of Italy, told a parliamentary hearing on Tuesday. \u201cOscillations in its value also have effects on the Italian individuals, families, companies and financial institutions that hold it.\u201dPolls show that Italians do not want to give up the euro, a fact that may restrain the government. It has shown in the past it would react to pressure, appointing a moderate, Giovanni Tria, as finance minister after objections were raised to the initial choice, Paolo Savona, an economist who had written about exiting the euro.But Mr. Tria has been worn down by the lengthy budget negotiations and subjected to humiliating attacks by the leaders of the League and Five Star Movement. In an audio recording leaked to the Italian media, a high-ranking official in the government who is also a prominent member of the Five Star Movement threatened to fire bureaucrats under Mr. Tria if they couldn\u2019t find money to get the welfare measure in the budget.On Tuesday, Claudio Borghi, the president of the budget commission in the Lower House of Parliament who is a member of the euroskeptic League, cut off Mr. Tria\u2019s microphone during committee hearings.Mr. Tria has insisted he is not considering resigning.Provoking Brussels has been a winning political strategy for the current crop of Italian leaders, and they show no signs of giving it up.\u201cWe care about markets,\u201d Mr. Di Maio said in a television interview last week. But faced with a choice between bond yields and the Italian people, he added, \u201cI choose the Italian people.\u201dAdvertisement"}

In previous races, this approach has been more accurate than simply taking people at their word. But there are many other ways to do it.All estimates based on 477 interviewsIn these scenarios, higher turnout tends to be better for Democrats.Even if we got turnout exactly right, the margin of error wouldn\u2019t capture all of the error in a poll. The simplest version assumes we have a perfect random sample of the voting population. We do not.People who respond to surveys are almost always too old, too white, too educated and too politically engaged to accurately represent everyone.Based on administrative records. Some characteristics are missing or incorrect. Many voters are called multiple times.Pollsters compensate by giving more weight to respondents from under-represented groups. But weighting works only if you weight by the right categories and you know what the composition of the electorate will be. In 2016, many pollsters didn\u2019t weight by education and overestimated Hillary Clinton\u2019s standing as a result.Here are other common ways to weight a poll:All estimates based on 477 interviewsJust because one candidate leads in all of these different weighting scenarios doesn\u2019t mean much by itself. They don\u2019t represent the full range of possible weighting scenarios, let alone the full range of possible election results.About 9 percent of voters said that they were undecided or refused to tell us whom they would vote for. If they were to break 5 to 2 in favor of Republicans, that alone would be enough to change the lead in our poll, assuming we did everything else perfectly. (We could also be wrong on turnout or our sample could be unrepresentative. Or other voters could change their minds.)Percentages are weighted to resemble likely voters.Percentages are weighted to resemble likely voters; the number of respondents in each subgroup is unweighted. Undecided voters includes those who refused to answer.This survey was conducted by The New York Times Upshot and Siena College.Data collection by Reconnaissance Market Research, M.

It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States.

Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic.

{"Headline": "Ghosts of the Past, Embalmed in White Plaster", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byArt ReviewWASHINGTON \u2014 Some artists have careers that take juddering turns, with early works giving no hint of later, sudden shifts in style: El Greco or Turner, Frank Stella or Philip Guston. Then there are artists \u2014 and it\u2019s no vice \u2014 who stay the course. They find a style or principle early on, and, like Voltaire\u2019s Candide, they cultivate their garden, over decades. They devote themselves to a single color, like Robert Ryman and white, or a single subject, like On Kawara and dates, and in the studio each day they make artworks that are always in concert but never the same.Since the late 1980s, the British sculptor Rachel Whiteread has held firm to one of the clearest and most poetic techniques in contemporary art: taking an everyday item, an architectural volume, even an entire house, and casting the spaces they occupy rather than the objects themselves.In the traditional lost-wax casting process, a sculptor makes a form of plaster or clay, shapes a mold around it, then fills the mold with liquefied metal, once or multiple times. For Ms. Whiteread, objects and spaces are themselves the molds \u2014 and are often destroyed in the creation of her ghostly negatives. The air around a large Victorian tub becomes a coffin of vermilion rubber; the voids beneath chairs cohere into colored resin, which the artist arrays like large gummi candies. A bath, a cardboard box, the books of a lost library: These are the molds for Ms. Whiteread\u2019s sculptures, mute and mummified.The show is cool, measured and a little too unshowy for its own good. Some of her pale casts get lost in the largest of the triangular galleries of the museum\u2019s I.M. Pei-designed East Wing. (Walls painted any color but white might have helped.) The retrospective, perhaps by necessity, shortchanges her large-scale sculpture, too large to travel, and can only evoke her public art in part. Yet I found the National Gallery\u2019s show poignant, not only in the traces of memories on her most successful sculptures \u2014 but in aggregate, as a model of unshaken artistic commitment over half a lifetime.Though she drew inspiration from postwar American sculpture, Ms. Whiteread\u2019s solidifications reintroduced human emotions into abstract art and subtly engaged with love, fear, illness and death. Her early casts also had a social orientation that, it seems to me, gets far too little attention. The daughter of Labour Party activists, Ms. Whiteread came of age as Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government was undertaking a wholesale transformation of British society \u2014 breaking down its welfare state and privatizing swathes of public housing.Seen together, her objects lose some of their strangeness, and the installation of a dozen or more sculptures in some galleries here has a reductive effect. So be sure to look closely at her resin impressions of windows, whose panes bulge out and mullions cave in, or her delicate drawings of the undersides of stairwells, and the individuality of her sculptures emerges. The drawings, especially, reveal how sculpting absence is no rote process for Ms. Whiteread, but a trial-and-error enterprise in which memory and politics fuse in ways she cannot fully predetermine.Earlier this year, I stood in front of the Vienna memorial, not another soul on the Judenplatz in the dead of midwinter. The sky was gray, the windows around the square pulled shut. I ran my hand across the corrugated white surfaces of Ms. Whiteread\u2019s silent, stern room, and I held back my tears in front of its doors \u2014 or, precisely, its negative casts of absent doors, offering no admission and no escape. There were bouquets of flowers left at the threshold; soon they would wither and later be replaced. What would not wither was Ms. Whiteread\u2019s bereavement, the size of one family\u2019s living room but weighing as much as six million.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "A $7.1 Billion Car Parts Acquisition Is a Glimmer of Hope in a Gloomy Sector", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsThe car parts supplier Magneti Marelli is to be acquired by the investment firm KKR for $7.1 billion.A $7.1 billion acquisition of a Fiat Chrysler-owned car parts supplier could send auto industry valuations into a spin.The investment group KKR will pay 16 times next year\u2019s earnings for Magneti Marelli. The parts supplier will be merged with another KKR portfolio company, Calsonic Kansei, which also provides car parts.The multiple that KKR will pay is double what publicly traded car-parts peers are worth, according to data from Refinitiv. And shares of leading auto manufacturers trade at an even bigger discount.Shareholders have reasons to be downbeat about the auto sector. A slowdown in China and worries that new fuel-economy standards will hurt demand in Europe have led to a number of profit warnings in recent months from suppliers like Continental and Michelin, as well as carmakers including Daimler and BMW.It could be that KKR overpaid. Its return on invested capital may be as low as 10.7 percent by 2023 assuming it cuts 300 million euros (or about $350 million) of costs, grows operating profit 3 percent a year and pays 28 percent in taxes. That\u2019s a mediocre return for a private-equity deal, which puts the onus on KKR and Calsonic to slash more expenses, boost revenue or hunt for more deals.The deal is certainly a coup for the Fiat Chrysler chief executive Mike Manley, who took over both the company and negotiations with KKR in July after his predecessor, Sergio Marchionne, fell ill and later died. Mr. Manley now gets to choose how to divvy up the proceeds between shareholders and investments in electric- and autonomous-vehicle technology, where Fiat Chrysler lags.But the vote of confidence from KKR, a typically savvy investor, contrasts with how public investors feel about the sector. All the major carmakers trade at well below 10 times earnings. Daimler and General Motors now trade below six times 2019 estimates, while Fiat Chrysler, Renault and Volkswagen languish at around five times. That suggests shareholders believe the bottom line will shrink drastically in the future.Worse still, it looks like investors are assuming that some carmakers will soon be worthless. Fiat Chrysler, for example, should generate 10.5 billion euros of free cash flow in the next three years, according to estimates made by Refinitiv. Even if it shrinks by 5 percent a year after that, the company would earn its current enterprise value in free cash flow by 2027 at an 8 percent discount rate \u2014 implying it has no value whatsoever after that point.That already looked overly pessimistic. KKR is helping to make the point.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Japan, the Kit Kat Isn\u2019t Just a Chocolate. It\u2019s an Obsession.", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times. She has won two James Beard Foundation awards for restaurant criticism.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export.

In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924.

White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTrade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.For millions of Latin Americans, the Colombina factory in La Paila is the place where sweet moments are made.Leer en enspa\u00f1olFor nearly 50 years, Bon Bon Bums have been produced in the Colombina factory in La Paila, north of Cali. At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Austerity Is Over, Britain Says, Despite Brexit Uncertainty", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAusterity is \u201cfinally coming to an end,\u201d Britain\u2019s chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, declared on Monday as he outlined new public spending. But he warned that financial plans could change if Britain does not reach a deal on withdrawing from the European Union.Delivering his final budget speech before Britain\u2019s scheduled exit from the bloc next March, Mr. Hammond announced a tax on multinational digital giants that have been widely criticized for paying little taxes in many European nations.But his big political message was a promise to end a long-running squeeze on public spending with an injection of extra money for health, education, defense and even for repairing potholes on highways. The amount employees can earn before they pay income tax will also rise, helping increase take-home pay.Mr. Hammond told lawmakers that if Britain could strike a deal with the European Union, there would be a \u201cdouble Brexit dividend\u201d as certainty returns, and that the government has the leeway to spend money being held back as a contingency in case of a chaotic departure next March without any deal.But Mr. Hammond\u2019s financial plans are generally based on the assumption that Britain negotiates the type of exit he wants from the European Union: not only a smooth departure, but one that maintains close economic ties to the bloc. On Monday, he said that as a precaution he was \u201cretaining firepower to intervene if the economy needs more support,\u201d and that, if the outlook changes, he might hold another full budget in the spring.Hard-line Brexit supporters within Mr. Hammond\u2019s Conservative Party want a cleaner break with the bloc, and some are threatening to vote against any Brexit deal that ties Britain too closely to the European Union. So his comments will be seen as a reminder to them of the economic \u2014 and political \u2014 consequences of anything that risks an orderly departure from the bloc of the type he wants.Critics argue that Mr. Hammond is still not planning to be aggressive in reversing those policies, and that some cuts will continue, particularly to capital spending.\u201cAusterity is not over,\u201d said Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour Party, who added that it had caused \u201creal hardship to millions of our citizens.\u201dMr. Hammond said the budget deficit would be less than 1.4 percent of the total budget next year, with borrowing this year 11.6 billion pounds, or $14.7 billion, lower than was forecast in the spring. Next year\u2019s growth forecast was upgraded to 1.6 percent from 1.3 percent.But over all, the picture is not so rosy. Debt remains high, at around 84 percent of gross domestic product compared with around 34 percent in 2001, and productivity growth remains stubbornly low.Among other announcements on Monday was more money to cushion the impact of a new system of welfare payments called universal credit that critics say is pushing some people into acute poverty.Mr. Hammond also promised a tax on some plastic packaging and investment in Heathrow Airport in London so that electronic passport gates could be used by visitors from the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Japan.One of the biggest announcements was of plans for a new digital services tax directed at large technology companies that pay relatively little tax in Britain.\u201cA new global agreement is the best long-term solution,\u201d Mr. Hammond said.Details of the proposed levy were scarce, but Mr. Hammond said he planned to introduce it in 2020 and that the annual revenue would be around \u00a3400 million.\u201cI emphasize that this is not an online sales tax on goods ordered over the internet,\u201d he said, adding that Britain would continue to work with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the Group of 20 economies to seek a globally agreed solution for taxing such companies.\u201cIf one emerges, we will consider adopting it in place of the U.K. digital services tax,\u201d he added.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Tell Us 5 Things About Your Book: College Athletics and Its Corporate Sponsors", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byQ. & A.When did you first get the idea to write this book?It began with a couple of small freelance stories that I wrote for The New York Times back in spring 2014. I had just come back from Tokyo, where I had spent a year studying. Back in Portland, where I had lived before moving, I woke up one day and there was a police report that had been leaked, with really graphic details concerning an allegation by a freshman at the University of Oregon who said that three of the school\u2019s basketball players had sexually assaulted her. I spent a week in Eugene covering the initial fallout: Why did the university sit on this for a couple of months? Why did they keep it out of the public crime logs? Why were those guys allowed to play in an N.C.A.A. tournament while they were under investigation for this?Those stories became my master\u2019s project at Columbia University\u2019s Journalism School. When I graduated, in 2015, I decided it needed to be a book, because the questions kept getting bigger and the answers kept getting more shocking.What\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?I was really shocked to learn the lengths that Phil Knight went to in order to get his way when it came to dictating how the University of Oregon would be run, like during a well-publicized disagreement over a student protest movement that called on Nike for things like spot inspections at its factories for possible human rights violations.Publicly, Knight did the sorts of things you might expect a billionaire corporate benefactor to do when a school he supports criticized his company. It wasn\u2019t news to me that he had withdrawn some promised funds for renovations at a stadium at the school, but I was shocked to learn some of the personal things he did behind the scenes to the university\u2019s president Dave Frohnmayer to twist his arm. I don\u2019t call it extortion in the book, but one of the sources I quote does call it that.A few years later, Knight\u2019s getting people he doesn\u2019t like fired, and getting people he likes hired. That\u2019s an evolution further down that same road. But the key moment is Knight demonstrating that he has the power and influence to have his way in opposition of the clear will of the students, the faculty and basically everyone except for him and a few key administrators.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?I thought I was writing a book about what has gone on at the University of Oregon in the past two and half decades. It turned out I was writing a book about a phenomenon that\u2019s taking place now at a number of public universities across the country. University of Oregon, for me, is a canary in the coal mine, because Oregon\u2019s taxpayers, back in 1990, decided to drastically disinvest in support for higher education at a time when other states weren\u2019t doing that. They were ahead of that trend. So many others states and so many other schools have followed suit. Many schools have looked around for short-term solutions to this problem, and the University of Nike blueprint is a pretty compelling one. It\u2019s a very dangerous road that a lot of universities are headed down, and they do it because university presidents take a short-term view that they come into town with a mandate no greater than: build something, put your name on it and go somewhere else for a bigger paycheck. And benefactors like Nike make that much easier.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Persuade someone to read \u201cUniversity of Nike\u201d in 50 words or less.More than ever, it\u2019s really important for Americans to closely examine the costs of abandoning public institutions and hand them over to corporate interests to save a few dollars on our tax bills. This is a case study of what happens when we do that. Spoiler alert: It ends badly.This interview has been condensed and edited.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Making Sense of the Selling in the Stock Market", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome stock declines are more foreboding than others.The selling that has driven down the markets continued on Friday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 9 percent from its peak in September, and on pace for its worst month since the 2008 financial crisis. Swoons like this one can be unnerving, in part because they suggest all is not well with the broader economy.But some of the selling may not augur much.Take technology stocks, whose recent declines have played a big role in dragging down the overall market. Shares of big tech companies have soared this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up more than 17 percent at its peak this year and 55 percent since Donald J. Trump was elected president.That left tech stocks vulnerable to a sharp sell-off.That\u2019s why the declines in shares of companies like Netflix and Amazon this month say more about their stock market valuations than the state of the wider economy.Earlier this year, Netflix was trading at 110 times the earnings Wall Street analysts expected the company to make over the next 12 months, according to FactSet. That multiple is many times that of the wider market and suggests that investors were confident Netflix would deliver on its ambitious goals. But big questions, including its ability to finance its growth and rising competition, hang over the company. The drop in Netflix\u2019s stock is thus evidence of healthy skepticism, rather than kneejerk bearishness about its future.But other selling cannot be so easily shrugged off.Bank stocks are down a lot this year. That\u2019s despite a strong economy, which typically leads to increased lending activity; rising interest rates, which have bolstered the profitability of banks\u2019 core lending business; the tax cuts enacted last year, which had an outsize effect on bank profits; and hopes for deregulation. Yet the shares of Citigroup, the nation\u2019s third largest bank, are down nearly 20 percent from their high earlier this year. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are all down about 15 percent this year.If bank stocks are a barometer for the economy, their poor performance points to some of the questions that keep investors up at night. Will President Trump\u2019s trade war soon start to do real damage to corporate earnings and the global economy? Will the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases crimp economic activity by depriving companies and households of the loans they need to finance purchases?A rout helps investors decide what\u2019s worth really worrying about. With the United States economy growing strongly, they may soon decide they\u2019ve been freaking out too much. A sustained upturn in bank stocks may show that their optimism is returning. But if they remain in the doldrums, real trouble may lie ahead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With a Hollywood Stunt, Cuomo Tries to Push Trump on Rail Tunnel", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump and Andrew M. Cuomo, the liberal governor of New York, may not share much common ground, but they both like to build big things.To make his case, Mr. Cuomo led a late-night expedition into one of the century-old rail tunnels beneath the river to gather evidence of the urgent need to replace them. And taking a cue from Hollywood, he brought along a film crew.\u201cIf anything is going to convince the president, seeing is believing,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday, standing on a flatbed truck that carried him over the rails halfway across the Hudson. The tour was turned into a video designed solely to win over an audience of one who sits in the Oval Office.The fate of the plan to build a new tunnel, known as Gateway, is in the president\u2019s hands. New York and New Jersey have pledged to provide half of the estimated cost. The administration of Mr. Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, had agreed to cover the other half. But the Trump administration reneged on that arrangement.\u201cWe\u2019re nowhere right now,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said, describing the state of talks between the regional officials and the White House. \u201cAre we open to negotiate? Of course. But there\u2019s just no conversation right now.\u201dMr. Cuomo\u2019s subterranean adventure was the latest pivot in a rhetorical turnabout for him. In 2015, he disavowed any financial responsibility for replacing the crumbling tunnels that carry trains operated by Amtrak and New Jersey Transit to and from Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan.\u201cIt\u2019s not my tunnel,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said at the time.But now he talks about the importance of maintaining a dependable rail link between New York City and the states west of it.\u201cThe New York concern is that these are people who are coming into New York to work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been easy but irresponsible for me to say it\u2019s not my problem.\u201dIt became his problem, at least in part, when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey became the sponsor of the Gateway project. Mr. Cuomo controls the Port Authority, along with his counterpart in New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy, who like Cuomo is a Democrat.The need for a new passageway grew much more dire six years ago when Hurricane Sandy flooded the rail tunnels with \u201ca toxic stew of Sandy salt water,\u201d said Rick Cotton, executive director of the Port Authority. Since then, he added, the residual salt has been eating away at the concrete-and-steel walls of the tunnels and corroding the high-voltage cables that provide power through the tubes to Penn Station.\u201cThis is what lies ahead on a massive scale if we don\u2019t replace these tunnels,\u201d Mr. Cotton said.Mr. Cuomo pointed out spots where large chunks of the concrete walls were missing, and steel spines that had rusted and splintered.Pressing his point, the governor climbed off the truck and onto one of the shelves that border the tracks, and dangled his leg into a chamber that holds the 12,000-volt cables. He peeled off a strip of metal so thoroughly rusted that it shed flakes as the governor pointed it toward the truck.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do to arrest it,\u201d he said. \u201cThe salt is in those cables.\u201dThat progressive decay is threatening to cause the shutdown of the tunnels for extensive repairs that would take years to complete, an inevitability that transportation experts say would cripple the economy of the Northeast. The tunnels, which were built in 1910, carry about 450 trains every weekday.During the commuter rushes in the morning and evening, as many as 24 trains pass through the tunnels every hour. But the shutdown of one of them would leave just one track in and out of the city, cutting the capacity down to just six trains per hour.\u201cI\u2019m hoping that when the president actually sees the video and sees the damage and understands that you\u2019re talking about the northeast United States \u2014 we\u2019re not talking about one subway stop here,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Cuomo said. \u201cI hope he gets the message.\u201dThe video was sent to Mr. Trump on Thursday. No word yet on whether he has seen it.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Introducing the Internet Bill of Rights", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDemocrats promise that if they win back the House, they will start regulating Silicon Valley.Ms. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. In an interview with me this week, Nancy Pelosi even suggested that a new agency could be created to manage tech\u2019s growing impact. \u201cSomething needs to be done,\u201d she told me, to \u201cprotect the privacy of the American people\u201d and \u201ccome up with overarching values\u201d \u2014 a set of principles that everyone can agree on and adhere to.Call it a Bill of Rights for the internet.To set the table, let\u2019s be clear that the tech industry has long operated nearly unfettered, aided by laws that have given its major companies broad immunity and an open plain on which to operate. The goal was to foster and encourage innovation. And like the pioneers who once set out for California to make their fortune, tech companies have thrived in that regulation-free landscape.But will it be too little, too late? Consider Mr. Khanna\u2019s list of principles, which begins by stating:\u201cThe internet age and digital revolution have changed Americans\u2019 way of life. As our lives and the U.S. economy are more tied to the internet, it is essential to provide Americans with basic protections online.\u201dIn short: Horse, meet barn door.The second says consumers should have to give their permission \u2014 an \u201copt in\u201d rather than \u201copt out\u201d system \u2014 before their data can be collected and shared with third parties. I like to call it the anti-Cambridge Analytica rule.Mr. Khanna noted that this requirement must be fulfilled in a way that is not onerous \u2014 consumers shouldn\u2019t have to click on something affirming their consent every time data is collected, for example. \u201cIf you have to click on something 50 times, it kind of defeats the purpose,\u201d he said.The third principle moves into a dicier area: the right \u201cto obtain, correct, or delete personal data controlled by any company.\u201d In Europe, this idea has manifested as the controversial \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d laws, which wouldn\u2019t fly here. Because of First Amendment issues, and also to prevent anyone from removing information that is merely critical, Mr. Khanna added a caveat that covers a lot of sins: \u201cwhere context appropriate and with a fair process.\u201dAnd so on down the list: The fourth centers on timely notifications in the case of breaches. The fifth would give consumers the right to move their data (called data portability). The sixth calls for making net neutrality a law rather than a regulation that gets Ping-Ponged every time a new administration takes office. The seventh would hinder big internet access providers like AT&T and Verizon from collecting more data than is necessary for the rendering of services. The eighth addresses fostering competition. The ninth would protect consumers from being \u201cunfairly discriminated against or exploited based on your personal data.\u201d And the tenth would demand that companies that collect personal data practice \u201creasonable business practices and accountability to protect your privacy.\u201dYou could call that last one the Equifax/Facebook/Yahoo conundrum: How do we protect consumers from endless data incursions and hacking by bad actors while also getting all the benefits of a fully networked society?It\u2019s an admirable list, but I suspect that if Democrats try to turn these principles into law, it will be like pushing back the ocean, especially since the business models of many of these companies are predicated on sucking up as much data as they can and exploiting it for gain. The consumer is the product \u2014 as much as insiders at companies like Facebook scoff at the idea.Mr. Khanna said he gets that it will be a slow road, and it will definitely require bipartisan support.\u201cThis is a 15-year fight, but I do not think tech is immediately primed against it and Congress is more willing to be strong on regulation,\u201d he told me. \u201cTech is amoral \u2014 it is great in many ways but not as great in others, and they need to now spend the next 10 years thinking about how they shape that tech for public good.\u201dMs. Pelosi said that national legislation does not have to be hostile, noting that tech companies know that public sentiment is turning against them. She said that more and more people are \u201caware that there is some vulnerability with the status quo\u201d and that she believes that \u201clegislation would get public support.\u201dIt already has in Europe \u2014 which has become the leader in stopping tech\u2019s aggressive march \u2014 and in Ms. Pelosi\u2019s home state, California, which has passed many of the kinds of laws that Congress should be considering.Recent legislation out of Sacramento has included the nation\u2019s most significant privacy law, as well as another on net neutrality (which is now being challenged by the Trump Justice Department) and even one to require publicly traded companies operating in the state to have at least one woman on their board.The federal government is very late to the party, but Ms. Pelosi promised that if Democrats get back the House in November, there will be a push for action.\u201cIt is not a question of being antagonistic, but being ready to find a better way for the future,\u201d she said, noting how quickly change has come via tech. \u201cThink backward a dozen years and look forward a decade. Like they say, you haven\u2019t seen nothing yet.\u201dIt\u2019s certainly well past time to see something from the politicians whose job it is to protect the rest of us.You should have the right:(1) to have access to and knowledge of all collection and uses of personal data by companies;(2) to opt-in consent to the collection of personal data by any party and to the sharing of personal data with a third party;(3) where context appropriate and with a fair process, to obtain, correct or delete personal data controlled by any company and to have those requests honored by third parties;(4) to have personal data secured and to be notified in a timely manner when a security breach or unauthorized access of personal data is discovered;(5) to move all personal data from one network to the next;(6) to access and use the internet without internet service providers blocking, throttling, engaging in paid prioritization or otherwise unfairly favoring content, applications, services or devices;(7) to internet service without the collection of data that is unnecessary for providing the requested service absent opt-in consent;(8) to have access to multiple viable, affordable internet platforms, services and providers with clear and transparent pricing;(9) not to be unfairly discriminated against or exploited based on your personal data; and(10) to have an entity that collects your personal data have reasonable business practices and accountability to protect your privacy.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "They Said Seattle\u2019s Higher Base Pay Would Hurt Workers. Why Did They Flip? ", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byResearchers whose findings last year pointed to a downside from raising the minimum wage have taken another look and the reality is more nuanced.The earlier paper created an immediate political sensation, not least because the researchers had access to highly detailed data on worker wages and hours \u2014 the kind of information generally not available to the authors of other studies.In light of the new paper, do commentators on both sides suddenly have to reassess?\u201cWe\u2019re prepared to have a lot of people come out and say we\u2019re contradicting ourselves,\u201d said Jacob Vigdor, an economist at the University of Washington who is an author of the study. \u201cThat we\u2019re flip-flopping.\u201d He cautioned, however, that the truth was more complicated. Here\u2019s why.In their latest paper, which has not been formally peer reviewed, Mr. Vigdor and his colleagues considered how the minimum-wage increases affected three broad groups: People in low-wage jobs who worked the most during the nine months leading up to and including the quarter in which the increase took effect (more than about 600 or 700 hours, depending on the year); people who worked less during that nine-month period (fewer than 600 or 700 hours); and people who didn\u2019t work at all and hadn\u2019t during several previous years, but might later work. The latter were potential \u201cnew entrants\u201d to the ranks of the employed, in the authors\u2019 words. The workers who worked the most ahead of the minimum-wage increase appeared to do the best. They saw a significant increase in their wages and only a small percentage decrease in their hours, leading to a healthy bump in overall pay \u2014 an average of $84 a month for the nine months that followed the 2016 minimum-wage increase.It\u2019s the final group of workers \u2014 the potential new entrants who were not employed at the time of the first minimum-wage increase \u2014 that Mr. Vigdor and his colleagues believe fared the worst. They note that, at the time of the first increase, the growth rate in new workers in Seattle making less than $15 an hour flattened out and was lagging behind the growth rate in new workers making less than $15 outside Seattle\u2019s county. This suggests that the minimum wage had priced some workers out of the labor market, according to the authors.\u201cFor folks trying to get a job with no prior experience, it might have been worth hiring and training them when the going rate for them was $10 an hour,\u201d Mr. Vigdor speculated, but perhaps not at $13 an hour.(Mr. Vigdor conceded that it was somewhat unclear when the divergence between Seattle and the rest of the state began, which could make the explanation less persuasive, and that this required additional study.)Mr. Vigdor said the two studies were broadly consistent when considering the effect both on workers employed at the time of the increases and workers who might soon seek employment. The minimum-wage increases helped people who were already working low-wage jobs, hurt people who weren\u2019t yet working, and had a somewhat negative effect on pay over all. (Mr. Vigdor and his colleagues have revised the earlier paper so that the large negative effect they initially found after the second minimum-wage increase was smaller: an average loss of $74 a month instead of $125.)Other researchers were more skeptical. When last year\u2019s study came out, Ben Zipperer, an expert on the minimum wage at the liberal Economic Policy Institute, pointed out that it failed to adequately account for the fact that Seattle\u2019s economy was growing rapidly when the minimum wage increases took effect.In a booming economy, Mr. Zipperer argued, we would expect to see fewer workers employed at\u00a0low wages \u2014 not because employers decide it\u2019s not worth hiring people, but because the competition for workers bids up wages, and many low-paying jobs disappear and are replaced by somewhat higher-paying jobs.Alternatively, many potential low-wage workers may decide it\u2019s too expensive to live and work in Seattle even with the benefit of a higher minimum wage, leading them to leave the city or not migrate there in the first place.In either case, it would be the boom, and not a minimum-wage increase, that was reducing the number of hours worked at low wages.\u201cAt the end of the day, it really to me points to the hazards of a single case study,\u201d he said. \u201cIf something contaminates the case study, like a shock to Seattle, you\u2019re out of luck. There\u2019s no counterbalance you can use.\u201dMr. Vigdor conceded that a boom could be partly distorting his team\u2019s findings. \u201cWhat we can\u2019t tell from our data is whether a lot of people are trying to find work and not finding anyone willing to hire them, or whether there just aren\u2019t as many people making the effort\u201d \u2014 because it\u2019s not worth their while to work in Seattle even at a higher minimum wage.Mr. Vigdor said the real contribution of the latest paper might be to force policymakers to consider who benefits from a minimum-wage increase and who doesn\u2019t, and whether that allocation of benefits is consistent with what a government is trying to accomplish.For example, one interpretation of the findings is that the Seattle minimum-wage increases helped workers who had languished in low-paying jobs for some time \u2014 perhaps parents working full time to support a family \u2014 while providing fewer benefits, or even causing harm, to workers like college students who seek part-time jobs for discrete periods to earn spending money or help pay for school.\u201cWhatever you think about that trade-off depends on your values,\u201d Mr. Vigdor said. \u201cWe want to illuminate those trade-offs, make them as clear as possible. But we aren\u2019t being paid the big bucks to make the final decision.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "I.R.S. Tax Fraud Cases Plummet After Budget Cuts", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTax evasion is at the center of the criminal cases against two associates of the president, Paul Manafort and Michael D. Cohen. The sheer scale of their efforts to avoid paying the government has given rise to a head-scratching question: How were they able to cheat the Internal Revenue Service for so many years?The answer, researchers and former government auditors say, is simple. The I.R.S. pursues fewer cases of tax evasion than it did less than 10 years ago. Provided you\u2019re not a close associate of President Trump, there may never be a better time to be a tax cheat.Last year, the I.R.S.\u2019s criminal division brought 795 cases in which tax fraud was the primary crime, a decline of almost a quarter since 2010. \u201cThat is a startling number,\u201d Don Fort, the chief of criminal investigations for the I.R.S., acknowledged at a New York University tax conference in June.Bringing cases against people who evade taxes on legal income is central to the revenue service\u2019s mission. In addition to recouping lost revenue, such cases are supposed \u201cto influence taxpayer behavior for the hundreds of millions of American citizens filing tax returns,\u201d Mr. Fort said. With fewer cases, experts fear, Americans will get the message that it\u2019s all right to break the law.Starting in 2011, Republicans in Congress repeatedly cut the I.R.S.\u2019s budget, forcing the agency to reduce its enforcement staff by a third. But that drop doesn\u2019t entirely explain the reduction in tax fraud cases.Over time, crimes only tangentially related to taxes, such as drug trafficking and money laundering, have come to account for most of the agency\u2019s cases.\u201cDue to budget cuts, attrition and a shift in focus, there\u2019s been a collapse in the commitment to take on tax fraud,\u201d said Chuck Pine, who used to be the third-ranking criminal enforcement officer at the I.R.S. and is now a managing director at BDO Consulting. \u201cI believe there are thousands of individuals who have U.S. tax obligations and are not complying with U.S. tax laws.\u201dThe I.R.S. declined to comment on its enforcement efforts.Mr. Cohen\u2019s and Mr. Manafort\u2019s cases illustrate different but common types of tax cheating, and how the I.R.S. has struggled to enforce the law. Mr. Cohen failed to report income from domestic businesses. Mr. Manafort used foreign locales and shell corporations to hide his money.The I.R.S. typically catches such evasion by auditing taxpayers. Theoretically, evidence picked up in audits can be used to start criminal cases.\u201cThe focus of auditors and tax collectors is not to identify fraud, it\u2019s to collect tax,\u201d said a special agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. Management has set other priorities, the agent said, \u201cso by default, the employees are not doing it.\u201dIn addition, current and former I.R.S. agents say audits are not as intensive as they used to be. Because the I.R.S. pushes agents to close audits more quickly, they make fewer requests for records and interviews.50thousand4033,20030Enforcement staff 20Includes examinations and collections personnel as well as special agents.100\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u2019171.0%0.80.60.5%Audit rate0.4Includes individual and business tax returns.0.20\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u20191750thousand1.0%400.833,200300.6Audit rateEnforcement staff 0.5%Includes examinations and collections personnel as well as special agents.Includes individual and business tax returns.200.4100.200\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201917\u201908\u201910\u201912\u201914\u201917Source: Internal Revenue Service\u201cThe quality of those referrals was also down,\u201d said Marie Allen, a recently retired auditor who worked at the I.R.S. for more than 30 years conducting complex financial investigations. \u201cThat is what people popularly think we should be doing, and I\u2019m trying to say it ain\u2019t so.\u201dBudget cuts have diminished the criminal investigation division, trimming the number of agents by a fifth since 2010. Recently, the I.R.S. closed four of its 25 field offices, according to Mr. Fort. In New York State, home of the country\u2019s financial industry, the revenue service is down to 161 agents, about a hundred fewer than it had 15 years ago.It doesn\u2019t help that many agents prefer chasing flashier crimes than tax evasion. Rob Warren, a research associate at Catholic University who previously spent a quarter-century at the I.R.S., interviewed 30 former special agents. He asked them which of their cases had been their favorite. The answers, Mr. Warren said, typically were only tangentially related to taxes.\u201cIt was usually narcotics, Ponzi schemes, some public corruption,\u201d he said. \u201cAgents loved Ponzi cases because there was a real victim, an old lady or something like that.\u201dFederal prosecutors seek out special agents for these cases because they are skilled financial investigators. And tax crimes, like failing to declare illegal income from, say, a bribe or cocaine sales, can be easier to prove than bribery or drug trafficking.In recent years, the I.R.S. has also been pulled away from classic tax-dodging cases by soaring rates of identity theft. I.R.S. management assigned scores of agents to chase perpetrators who used stolen identities to collect tax refunds.One tax fraud hotbed that has been a clear priority of both the I.R.S. and the Justice Department is going after money Americans stashed overseas without reporting it to the federal government. But there are clear reasons that Mr. Manafort, who hid his money in places like Cyprus and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, might still have escaped detection.\u201cWhat has happened over the last 10 years is real progress,\u201d Dr. Zucman said. \u201cBut what the data suggest is that it has not had a dramatic effect on the amount of offshore wealth.\u201d Money has flowed out of Switzerland and into Asian tax havens like Hong Kong and Singapore.Moreover, the I.R.S. has made little use of new weapons in the fight against wealth hidden overseas. In 2010, President Barack Obama signed a law that was supposed to provide a crucial tool for government auditors and prosecutors. That law, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, required banks with American account holders to report information to the United States. Like W-2 forms that employers file to tell about their workers, these reports would force account holders to come clean.The report found serious problems with the millions of records collected so far. About half, for example, didn\u2019t include identification numbers for the taxpayers, making it difficult to match the accounts with individuals. The I.R.S. hadn\u2019t set up a process for using the records. The agency said it was working on such a system.Here, too, the cuts to the I.R.S.\u2019s budget have had an impact. During the Obama administration, the I.R.S. asked Congress for hundreds of millions of dollars to carry out the program, but received nothing. Since Mr. Trump took office, the agency has stopped asking.Jesse Eisinger and Paul Kiel are reporters for ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest.Advertisement"}

It\u2019s a law of modern Western and East Asian history (we\u2019ll call it Macron\u2019s Law hereafter) that with wealth and education birthrates fall \u2014 and fall, and fall. The existence of occasional exceptions only highlights how exceptional they are.This plunge has happened without population-control interventions as well as with them, and because Western-supported population control efforts in the developing world tended to be inhumane and not-so-mildly racist, over the last couple of decades they have fallen somewhat out of fashion, with Gatesian philanthropists and politicians alike. So why are they creeping back into the discussion? For three reasons: Because African birthrates haven\u2019t slowed as fast as Western experts once expected, because European demographics are following Macron\u2019s Law toward the grave, and because European leaders are no longer nearly so optimistic about assimilating immigrants as even a few short years ago.Of course government efforts to raise the Western birthrate, France\u2019s included, have been no more obviously successful than Western-sponsored efforts to cut birthrates elsewhere in the world.But focusing on European fertility has at least one moral advantage over Macron\u2019s finger-wagging at African babymaking: It\u2019s the part of the future that Europeans actually deserve to control.Advertisement"}

It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L.

{"Headline": "Stocks Climb, Recovering From a Decline That Wiped Out 2018\u2019s Gains", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks rebounded on Thursday as strong earnings from major tech companies seemed to ease some of the worries driving a recent wave of selling that had wiped out the market\u2019s gains for the year.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index rose by 1.9 percent, to close at 2,705.57. The rise pulled the stock market back into positive territory for 2018 a day after a turbulent session had erased the last of the year\u2019s gains. Stocks are now up 1.2 percent this year.The rally on Thursday was a rare upward jolt in what has been a rough run for stocks. Investors have dumped shares over the past month, worried about factors that could threaten the economic and profit outlook for 2019, including the trade war with China, the Fed\u2019s plans to keep raising interest rates and the midterm elections.Those worries have largely outweighed the strong third-quarter sales and profit numbers that companies have reported since earnings season began this month. Thanks to a strong economy and corporate tax cuts, third-quarter profits for S.&P. 500 companies were on track to be up more than 22 percent, according to an analysis of reported results and projections by the market data firm Refinitiv.Instead, investors are scanning results for any indication \u2014 either in the profit guidance companies offer to analysts or in commentary from executives \u2014 that their fears of a rocky time ahead are warranted.\u201cIt\u2019s all about the guidance,\u201d said Maneesh Deshpande, head of United States equity strategy at Barclays. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s really driving stock movements.\u201dOn Thursday, stock in International Paper rose 10.3 percent after it posted better-than-expected results. Executives said they expected strong sales and profit performance \u201cto continue into the fourth quarter and into 2019.\u201d The chip giant Intel rose 4.5 percent after it raised its profit guidance for next year. Xilinx, a maker of programmable chips used in large data centers, shot up more than 15 percent after it increased full-year profit guidance.And Xilinx was only the S.&P. 500\u2019s second-best performer.Twitter posted its results, with revenue and profit topping forecasts, before the start of trading on Thursday, and its stock jumped 15.5 percent. Large tech companies also climbed. Shares of Microsoft, which reported positive results after the close of trading on Wednesday, rose 5.8 percent.The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose nearly 3 percent and is now up 6 percent for the year, but is nonetheless down 9.8 percent from its peak in early September.If investors were hoping that Thursday\u2019s rise means the latest period of volatility is at an end, they\u2019ll most likely be disappointed.Amazon, which rose more than 7 percent during the day, promptly tumbled in after-hours trading, after the release of its earnings report, which included a holiday forecast investors found underwhelming. And Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, whose shares had risen, dropped sharply when its results likewise disappointed.As long as investors feel that they don\u2019t have a good sense of what next year will look like, such volatility will almost certainly continue. More market swings could leave it ultimately treading water until conditions become more clear, Mr. Deshpande said.\u201cUntil we get through this we\u2019re just going to have this range-bound and very choppy market,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next.

Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L.

{"Headline": "Mark Hoplamazian of Hyatt Hotels on Airbnb and Why Stupid Questions Are Smart", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "Corner officeA lifer within the Pritzker organization, Mr. Hoplamazian reorganized the family business during an acrimonious feud, then took over the hotel chain.Supported byMark Hoplamazian, the chief executive of Hyatt Hotels, has worked for one family for the bulk of his professional career.He attended Harvard College and got his M.B.A. at the University of Chicago. After short stints at First Boston and the Boston Consulting Group, he joined the Pritzker family\u2019s sprawling business empire in 1989. Inside the Pritzker organization, Mr. Hoplamazian got an intense and varied introduction to business, working closely with Jay Pritzker, the family\u2019s influential patriarch, on companies including Hyatt Hotels and the industrial behemoth Marmon.But in the years after Mr. Pritzker\u2019s death in 1999, a family feud erupted, and it fell to Mr. Hoplamazian and his team to dismantle the Pritzker empire and try to appease warring factions. Eventually, Mr. Hoplamazian was made C.E.O. of Hyatt. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at the Hyatt Centric Times Square in New York City. What did your parents do? What was your first job? In the landscaping business, there are many different things you can do even as a kid \u2014 taking ivy cuttings and planting them in little peat pots to let them grow, digging trees, a lot of physical work. That\u2019s what I would do for summers and on weekends from the time I was 10, or even younger. I was driving tractors and trucks when I was 13, 14 and 15 years old.Is that legal? No. In fact, when I was 15, the first time I ever drove a truck on the road there was an amazing blizzard. It was 1978, I\u2019ll never forget it. It hit the whole East Coast. My brother had a contract to clear snow at this huge parking lot area, but he needed someone to drive one of the trucks over there to have it be available. He said, \u201cJust get in the truck. I know you can drive it, because you\u2019ve been driving around the nursery. Just follow me.\u201d We get on the road, and there was so much snow, and I\u2019m driving illegally at that time. The good news is, there was nobody else on the road.How did you wind up joining the Pritzker organization? A friend of mine was working with them, and I got a call from him. He said, \u201cSo we\u2019ve decided that we\u2019re going to probably hire someone of your experience level. Why don\u2019t you come in and meet Jay?\u201d I show up, and sitting at the table was Jay, the head of the machinist union at Eastern Airlines and his lawyer. Eastern was in bankruptcy, and so they were there pitching Jay on stepping in to take over the airline. At the end of that first meeting, Jay hands me the box of information they brought, and this was on a Tuesday. He said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come back on Friday and tell me what you think we should do?\u201d I didn't know anything about airlines, and I knew even less about bankruptcy. That was my interview.So what happened? I came back on Friday, and I fumbled around, I guess, well enough for him to say, \u201cO.K., the kid\u2019s not a complete idiot.\u201d Jay elected not to move forward with it.When you joined the Pritzker organization, what did they have you do? Their portfolio was very wide and broad. But it was a tiny organization, so the stuff that I was involved with was everything from selecting members of management teams to negotiating operating contracts for businesses and then doing financing. It was like up and down the functional dimensions and across many different businesses. It was great, diverse kind of business experience.How did you develop as a leader during this time, especially given that the organization was pretty small? There was a highly complicated deal that we did in joint venture with an Israeli company to launch a new business jet. Wildly complicated transaction. It was my deal. Jay basically said, \u201cGo see if you can make something work out of this.\u201d It was very, very, very challenging. There was lots of internal opposition. It was really a lesson in perseverance. I had to say, \u201cNo, actually, I believe in this, and I think I can get this done. I\u2019m going to compel myself to get it done even in the face of a whole bunch of opposition.\u201d Ultimately it was a very successful deal. And my position in the organization changed after that. When you walk through that barrier, you have a different sort of posture with a lot of other people. You were there when the Pritzker family sort of unraveled. In the case of the Pritzkers, I describe them as sort of like communists in some ways because it was definitely a collective effort. Jay\u2019s whole philosophy was: I\u2019m here helping the entirety of the family advance. It wasn\u2019t about my personal wealth versus others\u2019. In fact, the whole structure was a complicated trust structure for the benefit of all the family members. That is really the fundamental thing that changed when the food fight hit. The assertions were about lack of transparency and understanding how all this stuff actually worked. Most family-owned companies fall apart after the third or fourth generation because you have people who are involved in the business, and then a whole bunch of people who aren\u2019t. What was your role in the whole affair? Our group was responsible for mapping out how we were going to unwind the entire portfolio. We were holding these family meetings where all the principal beneficiary groups were coming together. There were more lawyers in the room than there were family members. It was like having the first annual meeting of an enterprise that was three generations old at that time, and I was the M.C. I had to stand up in front of the entirety of the family and lead the meetings. I did that for five successive years until I left to go join Hyatt. Then you started running Hyatt. What was it like moving from a small family business to a big company? It was pretty intimidating in some ways. I came into the business, and I was pretty ignorant. I knew a lot about the financial and tax structure of Hyatt because I had helped put the company together in the whole family reorganization. But I didn\u2019t really know the business; I didn\u2019t grow up in the business. That level of ignorance was super powerful because it just let me ask a whole bunch of stupid questions, which served me extremely well. Those simple questions often led to interesting discussions about why we do certain things the way we do, and that led to changes. But it was organic as opposed to me coming in thinking that I knew better. It was actually the result of inquiry.What\u2019s the biggest challenge facing the hotel industry today?The sharing economy is one. Of course, Airbnb is like the poster child for that because they have grown so quickly. The lesson for us in Airbnb when they first started was that a lot of what that customer experience was about was the attractive human interface between a guest and a real human being on the other side, not a trained professional. But the company has evolved. No longer is it typical that you\u2019re renting Aunt Millie and Uncle Ed\u2019s apartment, but it\u2019s Industrial Apartment L.L.C. #5 with 45 units in a building. It\u2019s become very institutional.I think Airbnb spurred a lot of focus around purpose and empathy and care as the cornerstone for why we existed, and from that perspective I think it\u2019s been great, because that\u2019s been tremendously beneficial in leading the company since then.You use the word empathy a lot. What are you getting at? We\u2019ve focused a lot of time and attention on mindfulness as a key capacity. In order to practice empathy, you have to be present, and one great vehicle to being present is to be mindful. Mindfulness became the central element of our wellness investment. Miraval and Exhale, our two brands that we bought, their foundations are around mindfulness, a mindful approach to nutrition, yoga, fitness, you name it. To me, first and foremost, I want people to be present, to be able to engage and really glean what\u2019s going on with someone. Don\u2019t be so focused on executing the checklist and the services that you\u2019re supposed to provide to them that you\u2019re skipping over what\u2019s really going on with that person.It\u2019s actually one of the things that we can do that is maybe not unique to our industry, but powerfully enabled by our industry. That is, bringing people with low skill sets into a vocational path that allows them to advance and have a career. One of the key problems in the United States, and actually this is a global phenomenon, is you have a large and growing number of people who are essentially disenfranchised. They\u2019re young people who are out of school and out of work. To me, this is the area of focus that we should apply ourselves to from a philanthropic effort, but also from a fulfillment of our purpose perspective. Bringing more and more people out of that community into our industry is something that we\u2019re focused on.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Number 7 Could Make China\u2019s Currency a Trade-War Weapon", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 As the United States and China swap threats and mete out increasingly punishing tariffs, the world is watching to see whether Beijing turns to one of its most potent economic weapons. It involves the number 7.China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, has been gradually losing value since mid-April, and on Tuesday it was at its weakest point in a decade. If the currency weakens any further, it could fall below the psychologically important level of 7 renminbi to the dollar. The last time it took more than 7 renminbi to buy a dollar was in May 2008, as the world was slipping into a financial crisis.The Trump administration doesn\u2019t like the idea of a weaker Chinese currency. That could give what it considers an unfair advantage to China\u2019s exporters. In the arsenal of trade disputes, currencies can be potent weapons.But China has good reason to keep its currency from weakening, and it appears to have acted in recent weeks to prop it up. Currencies may be potent weapons, but they are blunt ones \u2014 and they can boomerang against those who use them.There is nothing particularly threatening about the number 7 itself. The renminbi at 7.002 to the dollar is pretty similar to the currency at 6.998 to the dollar.But passing that number would be significant symbolically. It would suggest China is prepared to let its currency weaken further still. That would give China\u2019s factory owners an advantage when they sell their goods in the United States. It would also undermine the tariffs the Trump administration has levied on more than $250 billion in Chinese-made products.Say you own a Chinese factory making lawn ornaments, and you sell a lot of pink flamingos to an American retailer. You price each at $1 \u2014 they may sell for far more in the United States, but shipping and storage account for most of that. When the renminbi is 6 to the dollar, that translates to 6 renminbi in sales.But when the currency depreciates to 7 to the dollar, that $1 flamingo is worth 7 renminbi in sales to you. Or you can cut the price \u2014 say, from $1 to 85.7 cents \u2014 and still make your original 6 renminbi in sales. Your American competitor, who has to buy and sell in dollars, has to grudgingly cut prices to compete.(It\u2019s a lot more complicated in the real world. The plastic and metal for the plastic flamingo may have been imported to China and are priced in dollars. But bear with us.)A weaker currency can also help Chinese exporters beat President Trump\u2019s tariffs. Right now, the United States imposes tariffs of about 10 percent on a wide variety of Chinese goods that arrive at an American port. If the renminbi has fallen 10 percent, the tariff is basically nullified.Some politicians in the United States and elsewhere have long said that China manipulates its currency, even though Washington officials \u2014 including in the Trump administration \u2014 have stopped short of official accusations. But in this case, many of the forces weakening the currency are beyond Beijing\u2019s immediate control.China\u2019s financial system is firmly controlled by the government, giving the country\u2019s leaders a great degree of control over how much the renminbi is worth. Officials set a daily benchmark rate for the renminbi and allow its value to move a smidgen above or below that level in currency markets. Chinese officials say each day\u2019s trading activity helps determine the value they set for the renminbi the next day, but they disclose few details about how that works.On Tuesday, Beijing set that guidepost at 6.9574, just a hair\u2019s breadth stronger than 7. In the world of foreign exchange, a higher number means a weaker currency.There are other reasons. Since late July, Beijing has tried to prop up the economy by having the state-controlled banking sector increase lending, making money more available. That means even more renminbi sloshing around, weakening the currency\u2019s value.While China hasn\u2019t raised interest rates, the Federal Reserve in Washington has. That makes it attractive for many people to sell their renminbi and buy dollars. Would you rather have a one-year renminbi certificate of deposit that pays 1.5 percent interest now, or a one-year dollar C.D. that pays out 2.6 percent or more?Not quite. If anything, Beijing is trying to keep the renminbi from falling too fast.China has a number of ways to bolster the currency\u2019s value. One option is to follow the Fed\u2019s example and raise interest rates. That would give Chinese families and companies more incentive to keep their money in China. But that would raise the cost of borrowing in China, just as the economy is slowing.Beijing could buy up its own currency instead. Like anything else, the renminbi\u2019s value rises when it is scarcer.Thanks to the way it has managed its currency over the years, China has amassed the world\u2019s largest foreign exchange reserves \u2014 a $3 trillion stash of money it keeps in dollars, euros, pounds, yen and other currencies. It has begun to tap that stash. When China\u2019s central bank released its monthly balance sheet a week ago, it showed a drop of almost $20 billion in foreign currency just during September.\u201cSelling almost $20 billion in a month won\u2019t break the bank,\u201d said Brad W. Setser, an economist at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. \u201cBut it does indicate the direction of current market pressure.\u201dThree years ago, as its economy slowed, China devalued the renminbi in part to give its factories a helping hand. The financial world was shocked. Markets plunged.As Chinese officials hurried to explain themselves, people and companies began shifting their money \u2014 money that China\u2019s economy needed \u2014 outside the country. A year later, China had spent more than $500 billion from its reserves in an effort to shore up the renminbi. It later tightened controls on the financial system to shut off many ways people used to get money out of the country.Should the trade war intensify, China may look to make more aggressive moves with its currency. But as history shows, there can be a price to pay.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Did Trump\u2019s Attacks Hurt Harley-Davidson\u2019s Sales? It\u2019s Saying Little", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHarley-Davidson on Tuesday reported a surprisingly large decline in United States motorcycle sales.The company and its executives spent much time discussing the hit. Curiously, though, there was no mention of President Trump\u2019s attacks on the company and what role they might have played in the poor sales.Harley-Davidson\u2019s situation highlights the predicament faced by companies targeted by Mr. Trump. His administration\u2019s trade policies are hitting the businesses of many companies. If executives respond, they risk provoking a public rebuke from Mr. Trump that may reduce demand for their companies\u2019 products. But if his comments could be affecting their businesses, investors expect some details.Harley-Davidson\u2019s overall profit increased in the third quarter, but its retail sales in the United States plunged 13.3 percent from a year earlier, more than double the decline in the second quarter.\u201cThere was an inexplicable acceleration in the magnitude of the decline in U.S. retail sales,\u201d said Rommel Dionisio, an analyst at Aegis Capital. \u201cIn a fairly strong economy, it took many investors by surprise.\u201dThe sharp slowdown may have had little to with Mr. Trump\u2019s comments. Going into the third quarter, Harley-Davidson already faced a long-term decline in demand for its motorcycles in the United States as well as a glut of attractively priced used vehicles. Senior Harley-Davidson executives discussed such challenges on a conference call on Tuesday, but they said nothing about the possible effect of Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks.\u201cWe have no evidence to suggest that trade and tariff issues impacted customer intent to purchase,\u201d Patricia Sweeney, a company spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement after the conference call.Harley-Davidson\u2019s reticence about Mr. Trump\u2019s comments may shield it from further criticism. But public companies are required to give shareholders a timely and relatively detailed assessment of any significant forces affecting their financial results. Staying silent about the possible harm done by Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks may seem to be a wise public relations move, but it could also keep important information from investors.Some analysts said they saw no evidence that Mr. Trump\u2019s tweets had a meaningful effect on Harley-Davidson\u2019s third-quarter results.Felicia Hendrix, an analyst at Barclays, said that the quarter\u2019s sales were mostly in line with recent trends, and that September\u2019s sales were quite strong. Customers, she said, had held back on purchases early in the quarter in anticipation of the release of new products later in the period.\u201cNone of our dealer checks would indicate that there was any fallout from the Trump comments this summer or that they felt that customers were boycotting their stores,\u201d Ms. Hendrix wrote in an email.Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism may also have made Harley-Davidson\u2019s products more attractive to customers who don\u2019t support him.\u201cThis is a pretty divided nation,\u201d said Jaime Katz, an analyst at Morningstar, \u201cso for every customer that supports Trump\u2019s boycott, there is probably one who doesn\u2019t support it.\u201d\u201cI believe it was a temporary factor in the industry in impacting U.S. sales of Harley-Davidson motorcycles,\u201d said Mr. Dionisio, the Aegis Capital analyst.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Biggest Buyers of American Stocks Are on the Sidelines Right Now", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerican companies are the largest source of demand for American stocks, and sharp tumbles have come when their buying slows. Another element worth considering? The biggest buyers probably aren\u2019t buying. It may seem counterintuitive, but the largest single source of demand for American stocks is the American companies that issue them. Companies are on track to repurchase more than $770 billion in their own stock this year, according to research from Goldman Sachs. That\u2019s more than twice the size of the next largest source of demand, exchange-traded funds, which last year bought $347 billion in shares. But those companies are getting ready to report earnings, an event that is preceded by a regular slowdown in buyback activity. Some large market dips in the past year have coincided with these quarterly slowdowns. Keith Parker, head of United States equity research at UBS Investment Research, said the market has been weaker when buybacks have slowed. \u201cWhen that dries up or slows significantly, you\u2019re having outsized market effects,\u201d he said. When companies have more cash than they believe they can use productively, they typically return it to shareholders either with cash payments \u2014 known as dividends \u2014 or by repurchasing shares in the market. Buybacks raise demand, putting upward pressure on share prices.Such repurchases have boomed this year as the strong economy \u2014 and steep cuts in corporate tax rates \u2014 have left American companies flush with profits. Companies including Apple, Cisco Systems and Amgen have returned billions in cash to shareholders by buying back shares. Apple is responsible for the largest sum, spending nearly $64 billion on buybacks in the 12 months ending in June 2018, the last period for which full data is available, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.But corporate buybacks regularly slow around the start of the earnings reporting season, because companies want to avoid any potential legal risks from buying stock ahead of publishing their financial results. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be out there buying stock if you know good news is about to come out and the market doesn\u2019t know it,\u201d said Charles Elson, a professor of finance and corporate governance at the University of Delaware. This year, periods of reduced buyback activity have, at times, been accompanied by sharp sell-offs in stock markets. Around the time when buybacks dried up in late January, according to UBS data, the S.&P. 500 suffered an ugly drop, falling more than 10 percent from a record high. The market stabilized alongside corporate buying in early February. Likewise, a buyback slowdown in April was accompanied by a tumble in stocks. The stock market\u2019s capricious behavior cannot be traced to a single factor, of course. But a slowdown in buybacks effectively removes a lot of motivated buyers from the American exchanges, which might have been a stabilizing force.\u201cNo one else buys back share proportionately anything like the U.S.,\u201d said Ben Laidler, global equity strategist at HSBC. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a uniquely U.S. phenomenon.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "2018 Nobel in Economics Is Awarded to William Nordhaus and Paul Romer", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Yale economist William D. Nordhaus has spent the better part of four decades trying to persuade governments to address climate change, preferably by imposing a tax on carbon emissions.But Professor Nordhaus sadly noted that he hadn\u2019t convinced the government of his own country.\u201cThe policies are lagging very, very far \u2014 miles, miles, miles behind the science and what needs to be done,\u201d Professor Nordhaus said shortly after learning of the prize. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be optimistic. And we\u2019re actually going backward in the United States with the disastrous policies of the Trump administration.\u201dProfessor Nordhaus shared the prize with Paul M. Romer, an economist at New York University whose work has demonstrated that government policy plays a critical role in fostering technological innovation.\u201cThe message is that it\u2019s needed for countries to cooperate globally to solve some of these big questions,\u201d said Goran K. Hansson, the secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.That was described as a rebuke to the Trump administration by some proponents of stronger action to confront climate change. Under President Trump, the United States has pulled back from global efforts to limit climate change, and it has moved to reduce controls on pollution.\u201cAny Nobel Prize linked with global climate change will inevitably be seen as an international critique of Mr. Trump\u2019s outspoken opposition to domestic and international climate change action,\u201d said Robert Stavins, head of the Environmental Economics Program at Harvard.Professor Romer, for his part, offered a more optimistic take on the challenges confronting society, saying that his work showed that governments could drive technological change. He noted the success of efforts to reduce emissions of ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons in the 1990s.\u201cOne problem today is that people think protecting the environment will be so costly and so hard that they want to ignore the problem and pretend it doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Professor Romer said at a news conference after the announcement. \u201cHumans are capable of amazing accomplishments if we set our minds to it.\u201dThe day began with a little comedy, as the Swedes struggled to contact the winners.Professor Romer said he heard his phone ring, twice, in the early morning hours, but he did not answer because he assumed it was a spam call. Then he checked caller ID and saw the call was from Sweden. So he called back and, after waiting on hold, learned he had won the Nobel Prize.Professor Nordhaus said he slept in, only learning that he won the prize when his daughter called.\u201cShe said, \u2018It\u2019s so nice!\u2019\u201d Professor Nordhaus recounted, \u201cand I said, \u2018What?\u2019\u201dProfessor Nordhaus, 77, graduated from Yale in 1963, earned a doctorate in economics from MIT in 1967 and then returned to Yale as a member of the economics faculty. He has been there ever since.In the 1970s, amid rising concern about pollution, economists including Professor Nordhaus began to argue that taxation was the most effective remedy: The government should require polluters to pay for damage to the environment and to public health. The idea remains broadly popular among economists.\u201cThere is basically no alternative to the market solution,\u201d Professor Nordhaus said Monday.To assess the costs of climate change, including crop failures and flooding, Professor Nordhaus developed an economic model he called the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model, or DICE.The name, he said, \u201cconsciously aimed to suggest that we are gambling with the future of our planet.\u201dThe approach developed by Professor Nordhaus remains the industry standard. It undergirds the new United Nations report on the dangers of climate change, released Monday in South Korea, which warns that avoiding significant damage will require the international community to quickly coordinate changes in environmental regulation on a scale that has \u201cno documented historic precedent.\u201dThe Nobel committee cited Professor Nordhaus for showing \u201cthe most efficient remedy for problems caused by greenhouse gases is a global scheme of universally imposed carbon taxes.\u201dHe used the example of artificial light, calculating that the amount of work required to produce a given amount of illumination had decreased much more sharply than the standard measures of the price of light. His technique was also unusual: He created his own fires, for example acquiring an authentic Roman oil lamp to measure the light it produced.Professor Romer, 62, was honored for loosely related work on the determinants of economic development.Economists who studied the broad workings of the economy understood that the pace of innovation was influenced by human behavior, but they had not mastered the details. As a result, they often treated innovation as manna from heaven, and not a legitimate subject of public policy.Professor Romer received his bachelor\u2019s degree and doctorate from the University of Chicago. He has spoken publicly about his struggles with dyslexia, joking that he found the strength to keep writing by telling himself, \u201cIf Neil Young can make a living as a singer, I can make a living as a writer.\u201dHe said he was attracted to growth theory because he was intrigued by the acceleration of innovation that is a hallmark of the modern era. In papers in the 1980s and 1990s, Professor Romer developed the idea that nations could foster innovation by investing in research and by writing laws governing the ownership of intellectual property that rewarded innovation, but not excessively.He argued that differences in policy helped to explain differences in economic growth.In an interview, Professor Romer said the value of his work was in being precise about a broadly intuitive idea. \u201cIt helps to see connections that weren\u2019t obvious at first,\u201d he said.In particular, his work elucidated the benefits of scale. While a community might meet its own material needs, larger communities will still tend to produce more and better ideas. \u201cIt isn\u2019t just that we exchange mutton for port,\u201d Professor Romer said of the benefits of international trade. \u201cProbably the most important part of globalization is the sharing of knowledge that billions of people can all pursue in parallel.\u201dIn advocating for his ideas about growth, Professor Romer has sometimes courted controversy, telling one interviewer in the 1990s, \u201cI\u2019m quite happy to offend everyone.\u201dThere are broad commonalities in the contributions of Professor Romer and Professor Nordhaus.The prize committee emphasized that both men, in their work, have argued that markets are imperfect and that government intervention can improve outcomes.Joshua Gans, an economist at the University of Toronto, said both men also had helped to reduce the barriers to government intervention: In the case of climate change, by estimating the costs of inaction; in the case of innovation, by estimating the benefits of action.But both men still struggle to sell their ideas to policymakers.Professor Romer, who is the son of Roy Romer, a former Colorado governor, said economists needed to cultivate and husband a reputation as \u201cumpires in the fact business\u201d rather than openly campaigning.Professor Nordhaus lamented that that approach did not seem to be enough.\u201cWe understand the science, we understand the effects of climate change,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t understand how to bring countries together.\u201dBecause of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated, in one instance, Paul D. Romer\u2019s age. As noted elsewhere in the article, he is 62, not 77; William D. Nordhaus is 77.Coral Davenport contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

Emmet Flood, his impeachment lawyer, and Mick Mulvaney, his chief of staff, and Bill Shine, the supposed Great Communicator, were on the yellow sofas, while Ivanka and Melania faced him in the armchairs. Pence sat against the wall, trying to look as harmless as a mouse.\u201cThe pardons are on top?\u201d\u201cThose first,\u201d said Flood.He signed with the usual flourish. But halfway, a name stopped him. He tossed open the next four folders, then shoved all five off the desk, several pages of parchment flying free as the leather covers bounced on the rug.\u201cNo flippers. I told you. Cohen. Flynn. Stone. Gates. Manafort. They all talked tough then sat up for Mueller like little dogs. Not to mention the House impeachment hearings.\u201d\u201cMr. President,\u201d said Shine. \u201cYour statement will say you\u2019re issuing pardons so the nation can put the investigation behind it.

And I\u2019m sure as hell not pardoning those gutless bastards, if I can\u2019t pardon myself.\u201dFlood\u2019s lips rolled into his mouth briefly.\u201cSir, the Constitution says expressly that the president can be indicted after impeachment, which would make no sense if the president could pardon himself. That\u2019s why Nixon didn\u2019t do it.\u201d He held up a hand, smiling fleetly at Pence. \u201cBut I have faith that a pardon will come in good time.\u201d\u201cEmmet,\u201d he answered, \u201cwhat kind of idiot makes a deal with nothing in writing?\u201d\u201cSir, that wouldn\u2019t be wise for the vice president.\u201dMulvaney and Pence\u2019s chief of staff had done some kind of fan dance.

Ford had lost after he pardoned Nixon.Still frowning, he opened the last folder.\u201cAnd what does this say exactly?\u201d The letter to Speaker Schiff and the Senate president pro tempore, Charles Grassley, was only a few lines, but he\u2019d tried to avoid reading since he was a kid.Flood answered. \u201cIt says you are invoking Section 3 of the 25th Amendment, because you can no longer carry out the duties of the presidency.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the lunatic section, right? That\u2019s not the cabinet and the vice president saying I\u2019ve lost it?\u201d\u201cThat would be Section 4. Section 3 is voluntary.

Not all of them are eager to defend voting to keep you in office. A Senate acquittal is not guaranteed. And you\u2019ll hand the Senate to the Democrats in the process, maybe with a filibuster-proof majority.\u201dFlood jumped in. \u201cAnd an impeachment trial will not serve you well. The Democratic managers will force you to testify or plead the Fifth in public. And we\u2019ve resisted the House subpoenas for your financial records, but Chief Justice Roberts will order those documents produced. The Russian transactions will create a very bad impression. After that, if you\u2019re pardoned, New York State is almost certain to indict you for money laundering.\u201dHe waited, then shook his heavy face solemnly again. For a long moment, no one spoke. Then Ivanka said quietly, \u201cDad, we\u2019ll lose next November.\u201dHe\u2019d endured all this pretty calmly, but now he felt anger, his constant companion, flushing through him.\u201cThat\u2019s crap,\u201d he said.\u201cDad, your polls have never recovered from the Mueller report.\u201d\u201cThe polls said I\u2019d lose last time.

She meant it.\u201cBut this way,\u201d she said, \u201cwhen Mike wins, you win. You\u2019re the winner.\u201dBy Zo\u00eb SharpThe Russian landed at Dulles after 48 hours of traveling. Of necessity, he came from Moscow by a circuitous route. A long way with a very specific task. There would be no return flight.In the airport bars, the TVs were tuned to different news channels but the story was the same. First the president\u2019s campaign manager, then his lawyer, a Republican congressman, former aides, family members. Those who weren\u2019t indicted were subpoenaed. House arrest had become fashionable.The Town Car sent by the hotel had a flat-screen for his entertainment on the 45-minute drive into D.C. The channel once snidely referred to as \u201cstate TV\u201d now delighted in showing long shots through the White House railings of men in uniforms removing boxes of incriminating paperwork. The president himself was not in residence. He was holed up on home ground.The walk across the hotel lobby included a brush with a businessman intent on his cellphone. The Russian did not touch the inside pocket of his coat, into which his new identity had been adroitly slipped, until he reached the desk and produced it.The clerk was slow to respond. His attention was on the TV in the bar.\u201cThey\u2019re saying the Russkies put him up to it,\u201d the clerk said, handing over his room key. \u201cAnd I voted for the guy!\u201dThe Russian shrugged. \u201cFake news. \u2026\u201dBut the clerk did not look believing.He spent a day in his suite, watching the slow grind toward impeachment.Around 11 p.m., his contact arrived. The man had been in deep cover for decades. In his briefcase was a bottle of Stolichnaya and a 9-millimeter Makarov semiautomatic pistol.\u201cThere is no other way?\u201d It was intended as a statement. It emerged as a question.They drank vodka until the early hours. The contact left for the airport. The Russian drank on alone. Throughout his career, he would have spent these hours going over the plan, the escape route. This time, there was no escape route \u2014 only honor. And death.At 7 a.m., he showered. The bar of soap had the hotel name stamped into both sides. He made sure to wash his ass with it. Then he shaved and ate a last room-service breakfast. He dressed in the porter\u2019s uniform that had been obtained for him, tucking the Makarov into the back of his waistband.When it was time, he went downstairs, took his place in the lobby before the entourage appeared. The hotel staff had been lined up to see their boss, the president, go by. A few of them applauded. Most did not.The president didn\u2019t seem to notice. He waved, in his desultory fashion. The Secret Service agents clustered around him, ushered him toward the armored limo idling outside at the curb.The Russian waited until they were a few steps past before he drew the gun. He sighted on the center of the president\u2019s back, and squeezed the trigger.The Makarov misfired.The Secret Service agent at the president\u2019s shoulder heard the click, spun into a crouch. He registered the scene instantly, drawing his own weapon with razor-edge reflexes.The Russian tasted failure. He closed his eyes and waited to pay the cost.It did not come.He opened his eyes. The Secret Service agent stood before him, presenting his Glock, butt first.\u201cHere,\u201d the agent said politely. \u201cUse mine. \u2026\u201d Moscow, November 2018. The Kremlin. A visibly agitated National Security Council is briefing the president of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin. The atmosphere at the table is one of barely controlled Slavic rage.Bortnikov of the F.S.B. interrupted. \u201cThese American cyberattacks have had wide-ranging effects: The high-speed Moscow Sapsan train was inexplicably signaled to stop by its onboard computer halfway to St. Petersburg, in the middle of the forest near Bologoye. The train would not respond to repeated computer commands to move. A dozen passengers descended from the train, intending to continue the journey by bus. Several of them are still missing in the snow.\u201dAlexey Likhachev of Rosatom spoke into his microphone. \u201cTrain signals along other rail lines are likewise unresponsive. Our entire rail system is locked up. How could this happen?\u201d President Putin glared down the table. He saw fear in the room.Bortnikov continued. \u201cThere\u2019s more. There apparently were early-morning, unauthorized news broadcasts from state-run Moscow 24 television. Engineers claim the transmission computers were hacked by an unknown foreign source in Scandinavia \u2014 without doubt the Americans \u2014 which was impossible to block or jam. These rogue broadcasts lasted two hours and were seen by an estimated 100,000 viewers. The programs covered recent food riots in Nizhny Novgorod and Kazan as well as a biopic about dissident punk band Pussy Riot starring the American actress Reese Witherspoon. Coming attractions for future broadcasts advertised a program entitled \u2018The Treasures of Putin\u2019s Black Sea Palace\u2019 narrated by Washington celebrity lawyer Lanny Davis.\u201dPresident Putin looked around the table before speaking. \u201cThese sensitive subjects are unacceptable and must be kept from the public. All intelligence organs must ensure that Russian television stations are immune to outside interference.\u201dPutin looked up. Butina was a personal favorite of his. \u201cThe Americans still hold her?\u201d Naryshkin nodded. \u201cTell her to be patient,\u201d said Putin. \u201cShe will be home soon enough.\u201d\u201cAnd the other operations?\u201d said Naryshkin.Putin stood up and headed for the door to his private office. He turned and pointed at his chief spook.\u201cContinue the phishing operation to penetrate the firewalls of The New York Times. Continue to collect the I.P. addresses, logins and passwords of Mueller\u2019s entire staff and hack into their servers. We shall soon see whether the Americans have the stomach for a second Cold War.\u201dThe room remained quiet while the president disappeared behind the door.By Laura LippmanI didn\u2019t watch it right away, but no more than three days went by before I plugged it into my computer. It is less salacious than you might imagine, more conventional sex than out-and-out deviancy. That\u2019s why I have downplayed it as a smoking gun that proves collusion. There is clearly something amiss with his hair. We glimpse a patch of skin at one point; it reminded me of that scene in \u201cThe Empire Strikes Back\u201d when we see Darth Vader\u2019s scalp. Not bald, but the hair is sparse, the skin pink and damaged looking. I think there might be plastic surgery scars. Is he vain enough to kill anyone who sees this? It\u2019s not a rhetorical question.What little audio there is \u2014 aside from heavy breathing \u2014 is innocuous. He mocks the room, saying only a \u201cterrible, no-class president who doesn\u2019t know from luxury\u201d would settle for such accommodations. He tells the women: \u201cMy hotels are so much better, they\u2019re the best, they\u2019re beautiful, come to the United States, I\u2019ll show you what real luxury is.\u201d Not a grave insult, but grave enough, apparently. The tape, as I tried to signal in an interview earlier this year, does not prove collusion, only the possibility of collusion. So why did someone send it to me? That\u2019s the question I asked myself, but it was the wrong question.And as much as Trump tried to tank it, he simply couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s how incompetent he is, how little he understands about the voters whose hatred he courted and stoked, the so-called deplorables whom he secretly considers losers. The joke was on the United States. Russia chose our president and they chose a fool. Because he made fun of a room at the Moscow Ritz-Carlton.My F.S.B. lawyer dropped by the other day, his conversation terrifyingly bland. He reminded me I have asylum until 2020. He asked after Lindsay, when she might visit again.Then, as he was taking his leave, almost as an afterthought. \u201cYou realize the promise that you wouldn\u2019t face the death penalty, or additional charges that carry the death penalty \u2014 that was Mr. Holder\u2019s pledge. The current Justice Department has made no such promises.\u201dWas that a threat? Would someone actually put me to death because I have this tape? Is Putin testing me, trying to find out how deep my patriotism goes? Could I save my country from this man? Isn\u2019t it consistent for me to protect the 45th president\u2019s privacy as I have tried to help others protect their privacy?I guess I have until 2020 to think about these things.By Joseph FinderThe president was in the White House residence, attending to his hair. This took a good half an hour, what with the Just for Men color (Sandy Blond, he\u2019d finally settled on), the rinse, the blow dryer, the comb and the hair spray. Then pivoting that side hank of hair back over his bald center lane and twisting and flipping it a bit so it jutted out in front just right. He allowed no one else to do it. Hairdressers talked.On the 110-inch flat screen, which took up most of one wall, he watched the footage of yesterday\u2019s rally in Orlando, maybe the greatest political rally in history.He should be feeling good. Even the fake-news polls showed him 15 points ahead of Pocahontas. The White House would be his for another four-plus years. Way past time for some serious renovation.But his new press secretary was weak. The fake news media was obsessed with Russia, and his guy would never punch back like Sarah used to. Maybe it was time to replace him.He remembered something Putin had told him in Helsinki, about how he\u2019d fired his chief of staff, Ivanov. He\u2019d said to the guy: \u201cSergei Borisovich, have you done the job I asked you to do? No? Well, God gives, and God takes away.\u201dThe impeachment of 2019 had been a big nothing. The House held its hearings, and the Mueller report was a best seller \u2014 because all books about him were. But the Senate held firm. End of story. And they weren\u2019t going to impeach him again.The phone trilled sharply, startling him out of his musing. It was his executive assistant, Madeleine. Something about a meeting in the Situation Room. It was urgent.\u2666\u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d he said, sinking into his chair at the head of the mahogany table in the Sit Room.Sitting alongside his senior cabinet members were all these anonymous gray-faced types his chief of staff kept saddling him with. Under secretaries and deputy directors \u2014 they had that Deep State smell of old tea bags.\u201cSir, another Russian dossier is circulating in intelligence channels,\u201d Gina Haspel, the C.I.A. director, said. \u201cThe ultimate source has to be someone high up. Kremlin-level. The details check out.\u201dTrump groaned. \u201cDetails. About what?\u201d\u201cAbout, uh, money laundering.\u201dTrump\u2019s face grew warm. \u201cI can always pardon myself.\u201d\u201cNot in New York State.\u201d Haspel exchanged glances with his White House counsel and slid a blue folder across the table. \u201cThis is a sample.\u201dTrump opened it and saw columns of figures and bank account numbers. His eyes crossed. He had no patience for spreadsheets.\u201cIt\u2019s a detailed list of transactions between the Trump Organization and three sanctioned Russian oligarchs,\u201d Haspel said. \u201cOffshore bank accounts and wire transfers, names, dates, everything.\u201dTrump looked up. \u201cFake news,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, no one cares about this stuff. It\u2019s too complicated.\u201d He looked around the table. Everyone was avoiding his eyes.\u201cCoats?\u201d Trump said. His director of national intelligence had always seemed reliable.In a small voice, a pained expression on his face, Coats said, \u201cSir, I\u2019m afraid this is unsurvivable.\u201d\u2666The red secure phone was already sitting on the Resolute desk in the Oval Office. He\u2019d had them change the gray Cisco IP phone to a red model, which looked more appropriate.\u201cYou have a rat in the Kremlin,\u201d he told Putin, without bothering to say hello. \u201cHe leaked a bunch of documents about my business interests. You need to track him down and shoot him in Red Square.\u201dPutin didn\u2019t even wait for the translation. He laughed. He didn\u2019t laugh often. \u201cSorry, but this is not possible,\u201d he said, in heavily accented English.\u201cWhy not?\u201dPutin switched back to Russian. The translation came quickly. \u201cDonald, have you done the job I asked you to do? You didn\u2019t get rid of the sanctions. Instead, your Congress has piled up more and more of them. You\u2019re paralyzed politically. The relationship between our two countries has been poisoned, and it gets worse all the time. I say, time to start over.\u201dThere was a long silence on the line.The line went dead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Notes on Global Convergence (Wonkish and Off-Point)", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhy rich countries stay different and middle-income countries surge.Opinion ColumnistOK, that said, I read two things in the past few days that had me thinking about the biggest economic story there is: the dramatic rise of some formerly very poor nations, and the concomitant shift of the world\u2019s economic center of gravity away from the West.I\u2019d argue that these observations are really part of the same story. Let me start with Branko\u2019s observation.I won\u2019t do a full statistical analysis, but let me give the example of France versus the U.S. Figure 1 shows French productivity \u2014 real GDP per hour worked \u2014 relative to the U.S., and relative real GDP per capita. What you see is that French productivity has matched that of the U.S. for many years (it was actually higher for a while, although that was probably a composition effect reflecting an older work force.) French real GDP per capita has, however, slid relative to U.S. levels. Why?So these are just different choices. And while France does need more pension reform (it has done some already), it\u2019s far from clear that overall French choices are worse. On many quality of life indicators, like life expectancy (Figure 2), America has fallen behind.The end of Western convergence, then, isn\u2019t an indicator of some kind of failure. Meanwhile, the coming of rapid convergence by emerging markets is a huge success story.When I was in grad school in the 1970s, I thought I should do development economics \u2014 because it was clearly the most important subject \u2014 but didn\u2019t, because it was too depressing. At that point it was mostly non-development economics, the study of why Third World countries seemed to fall ever further behind the West. True, we were already seeing a growth takeoff in smaller East Asian economies, but few saw this as a trend that would spread to China and India.Then something happened; we still don\u2019t know exactly what. It\u2019s a good guess that it has something to do with hyperglobalization, the unprecedented surge in world trade made possible by breaking up value chains and moving pieces of production to lower-wage countries. But we don\u2019t really know even that.One thing is clear: at any given time, not all countries have that mysterious \u201cit\u201d that lets them make effective use of the backlog of advanced technology developed since the Industrial Revolution. Over time, however, the set of countries that have It seems to be widening.Once a country acquires It, growth can be rapid, precisely because best practice is so far ahead of where the country starts. And because the frontier keeps moving out, countries that get It keep growing faster. Japan\u2019s postwar growth was vastly faster than that of the countries catching up to Britain in the late 19th century; Korea\u2019s growth from the mid-60s even faster than Japan\u2019s had been; China\u2019s growth faster still.The It theory also, I\u2019d argue, explains the U-shaped relationship Subramanian et al find between GDP per capita and growth, in which middle-income countries grow faster than either poor or rich countries. Countries that are still very poor are countries that haven\u2019t got It; countries that are already rich are already at the technological frontier, limiting the space for rapid growth. In between are countries that acquired It not too long ago, which has vaulted them into middle-income status, but are able to grow very fast by moving toward the frontier.The result is a world in which inequality among countries is declining if you look from the middle upward, but rising if you look from the middle down. Fundamentally, however, it\u2019s a story of diminishing Western exceptionalism, as the club of countries that can take full advantage of modern technology expands.It\u2019s not entirely a happy story. That concentration of income and wealth at the top is worrisome, not just economically, but for its political and social implications; it\u2019s one reason U.S. democracy is teetering on the edge. And there are still hundreds of millions of people left out. But there\u2019s also a lot of good news in the picture.I now return you to our regular political anxiety.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "FIFA and UEFA Headed to Showdown Over Plan for New Tournaments", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, is pressing forward with a plan for two new global tournaments that could reshape soccer\u2019s international calendar, putting it on the agenda for a meeting of the sport\u2019s leaders this week. But one of the organization\u2019s most powerful stakeholders is not happy about it, and is threatening to walk out of the gathering in protest.The proposal, a $25 billion plan for a revamped Club World Cup and a new national-team competition, is fiercely opposed by members of UEFA, European soccer\u2019s governing body.The proposal has been delayed since the spring, when Infantino introduced it, but FIFA added it to the agenda for its FIFA Council meeting on Friday in Kigali, Rwanda.Members of the council \u2014 FIFA\u2019s top board \u2014 are scheduled to discuss governance problems afflicting several national federations and will receive an overview from various committee heads. Then the conversation will turn to Infantino\u2019s pet project \u2014 the $25 billion offer from SoftBank, an issue that has created a contentious atmosphere among the game\u2019s leaders.The UEFA members are opposed to how the new tournaments would alter the world soccer schedule and devalue its Champions League competition, the most lucrative in the world. The new Club World Cup and the national-team league could also draw large numbers of fans, broadcasters and sponsors, replacing the largely unheralded current world club competition and the Nations League, which is in its inaugural edition this year.The $25 billion proposal has the backing of investors from Asia, the United States and the Persian Gulf, including from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which has piled into sports as part of ambitious plans by the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, to broaden the country\u2019s economy.\u201cThe meeting has yet to take place and many topics are on the agenda for discussion and debate, as always,\u201d a FIFA spokesman said. \u201cIt\u2019s strange that some people have gone directly to a conclusion.\u201dSeveral rounds of talks have taken place since then, but the European Club Association, which represents about 270 teams, still opposes the plans, as does the World Leagues Forum.\u201cAs long as I am UEFA president, there will be no room for pursuing selfish endeavors or hiding behind false pretenses,\u201d Ceferin told European Union ministers in May. \u201cI cannot accept that some people who are blinded by the pursuit of profit are considering to sell the soul of football tournaments to nebulous private funds.\u201cMoney does not rule \u2014 and the European sports model must be respected. Football is not for sale. I will not let anyone sacrifice its structures on the altar of a highly cynical and ruthless mercantilism.\u201dBut for Infantino, successfully pushing the proposal through would provide a timely lift. He is up for re-election next year, and he has promised to increase funding of development projects for each of FIFA's 211 members.The debate over the plan was put aside to allow this summer\u2019s World Cup to go ahead in a cordial manner. The fund\u2019s offer and the creation of new tournaments were kept off the agenda when the council last met, on the eve of the Russia World Cup in June.Infantino and Ceferin have rarely spoken since the contentious meeting in March, which longtime council members described as the most acrimonious gathering they had ever attended. Infantino has been using contacts cultivated during his time as a UEFA executive to try to persuade the biggest clubs to back his plan.SoftBank has been tight-lipped since news of its plans broke more than six months ago. The company has hired the management consultant firm McKinsey to evaluate its offer.According to people with knowledge of the situation, SoftBank has backed off from an initial 60-day deadline it gave FIFA to conclude talks about the plan. It proposed a guaranteed $2 billion for each edition of the national team competition and $3 billion for each Club World Cup.As they organize opposition to Infantino\u2019s plan, European clubs are also being courted by other groups looking to create a prestigious new tournament. Among them is Relevent Sports, a group backed by the Miami Dolphins owner Stephen M. Ross that already hosts the International Champions Cup, an annual series of exhibition matches played around the globe, including in North America. Relevent wants a more competitive format and has spoken with UEFA about its plans, according to people with knowledge of the discussions.Advertisement"}

The 101st is a monstrosity of gerrymandering that disenfranchises voters and weakens representative democracy in upstate New York.I have to start every conversation on the campaign trail with a show-and-tell session featuring a map of our district. Invariably, residents of both parties shake their heads at the absurdity of it. New York Assembly DistrictsRochesterUticaBuffaloAlbany101stDistrictNew YorkUticaAlbany101stDistrictNew YorkNYDETAILSource: Census Bureau | By The New York TimesThe northern tip includes the suburbs of Utica, while the southern end dips into Orange County to encompass a couple of New York City commuter towns. This last fact never fails to blow the minds of my neighbors in the 850-person dairy farming town of Westford, for whom New York City might as well be on another planet.The 101st district overlaps with, and cuts through, a number of counties, school districts and congressional boundaries.Overlaps With 4State Senate DistrictsOverlaps With7 Counties101stDistrictOverlaps With 3Congressional DistrictsOverlaps With 36School DistrictsOverlaps With7 CountiesOverlaps With 4State Senate Districts101stDistrictOverlaps With 3Congressional DistrictsOverlaps With 36School DistrictsOverlaps With 4State Senate Districts101stDistrictOverlaps With7 CountiesOverlaps With 3Congressional DistrictsOverlaps With 36School DistrictsSource: Census Bureau | By The New York TimesHow can anyone properly represent a district so incoherently drawn? It simply makes no sense geographically, economically or culturally; the people in the northern part scarcely speak the same dialect of English as those in the south, let alone face the same policy issues. Take just one concern: water. The suburban areas of New Hartford, near Utica, have complex issues regarding storm water drainage and flooding, while decades of underinvestment in infrastructure has left the residents of the village of Ilion, in nearby Herkimer County, with brown municipal water flowing from their faucets. The town of Delhi and the surrounding areas in Delaware County, in the middle of the district, fret about the stifling economic effects of being ringed by New York City-owned watershed land, while in my town, one hour north, every household has its own well water and septic tank, and no municipal water services are available at all. Drafting a districtwide water policy, or even a coherent articulation of our needs, would be nearly impossible. Similar regional complexities are to be found with any issue one might want to consider as a legislator tasked with representing this district.The 101st was drawn in 2012, so the story goes, by Republicans to punish one of their own caucus members yet remain a safe Republican seat. In other words, its design is actively antidemocratic. (Broadly speaking, anything that artificially makes a district less competitive makes it less democratic.)Ideally, an incumbent should be able to protect his or her seat only by being an effective and successful representative. A district such as ours, which is intentionally packed with members of one party, necessarily reduces the degree to which citizens of all parties are represented. When politicians pick their voters, they often no longer feel compelled to work hard in order to provide quality constituent services and thoughtful leadership.Counties are the natural unit of governance in rural upstate New York, and by slicing them up we weaken their ability to provide coherent stewardship. Consider the travails of the Soil and Water Department in Otsego County. In order to stitch together the resources needed for a countywide stream remediation plan, it must appeal to the good graces of four different Assembly members and a state senator. Or consider the plight of the ironically named town of Neversink, already drowned once to create a water reservoir for New York City and now the only town from Sullivan County to be politically isolated into the 101st. Also problematic is the village of Ellenville with a large bilingual and minority population, whose current representative in Albany lives three and a half hours away by car in the suburbs of an entirely different urban area.The consequences of districts being drawn like ours are more than theoretical. All across upstate New York, people of all political persuasions are ignored and underserved by a political system that feels dominated by the big city. Anything that adds to the frustration and confusion of voters reduces turnout and increases disillusionment with government in general. Incoherent districts drawn by our incumbents further fracture the political power of rural and small-town New Yorkers. The process weakens both the ability and the resolve of our elected officials to argue for the resources and attention we need to solve our specific regional issues, including finding ways to balance the economy with the environment, repairing our decaying physical infrastructure, the paucity of rural access to good health care, collapsing dairy prices, Stone Age internet and cellphone coverage, endemic rural poverty and an epidemic of opioid addiction.As a candidate working tirelessly to win over an electorate intentionally constructed to stack the odds against me while unequivocally opposed to the disenfranchising practice of gerrymandering, I\u2019m in an awkward position. Even as I make an earnest and passionate appeal to the far-flung voters of our district that, given the current circumstances, I would be their best and truest representative, I also promise that, if they elect me, I will seek to redraw our district at the next opportunity. It is a change that, if successful, will mean that I am in effect arguing to no longer represent some of the very people who voted for me.

{"Headline": "Sears Went From Gilded-Age Boom to Digital-Age Bankruptcy", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe retailer was the innovator of its time, building a thriving mail-order business before going brick-and-mortar. Now, much of that is going away. To an entire generation of young shoppers, Sears is the store they least want to visit in the mall they rarely patronize.But for much of its 132-year history, the company was at the forefront of American retail. Its early mail-order and distribution innovations made it the Amazon of the Gilded Age.In the last decade, however, little of that splendor has been evident. The company has lost money for years, its head count has fallen by hundreds of thousands of employees, and it has several thousand fewer stores than it did in 2008. Even the landmark Sears Tower in Chicago \u2014 which it no longer owns \u2014 was renamed, after an insurance company. Here are some key moments in Sears history.1886 Richard Sears, a railway station agent, started the R.W. Sears Watch Company in Minneapolis after buying a batch of watches from a local jeweler and selling them to fellow agents. The next year, he moved the business to Chicago and hired Alvah C.

But some companies worry that this opacity could provide cover for retaliation in response to tariffs that the United States has placed on Chinese goods \u2014 and wonder if long-negotiated deals could become collateral damage in the trade war.\u201cGiven the level of trade tensions now, in some exceptional cases you cannot exclude the possibility that individual transactions may be implicated,\u201d said Fay Zhou, a partner at the law firm Linklaters in Beijing.Officials at China\u2019s antimonopoly agency, the State Administration for Market Regulation, did not respond to requests for comment.American companies have prospered by exploring new markets and taking risks to extend their global reach. But President Trump warned last week that these were early days in his trade strategy \u2014 \u201cChina wants to talk, very badly, and I said, \u2018Frankly, it\u2019s too early to talk\u2019 \u201d \u2014 and American companies may encounter some backlash from Beijing.So China has only so many avenues to inflict pain. They could include slow inspections for imports at Chinese ports and tighter regulatory scrutiny of American companies doing business in China.Deals are a ripe area, too.\u201cThis is a way for China to put pressure on American corporations to get them to work on the U.S. government,\u201d said Chen Zhiwu, a professor of finance and the director of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong.Blocking American deals comes with some cost. Aggressive regulators could spur foreign companies to retreat from China just when economic growth there is slowing.\u201cChina has valid reasons to be angry with the Trump administration\u2019s protectionist tariffs,\u201d said Fred Hu, the chairman of Primavera Capital Group and a former chairman of Goldman Sachs for China. But, he added, \u201cit is unlikely to direct its anger at American businesses.\u201d\u201cOn the contrary, China is trying to cultivate ties with them,\u201d Mr. Hu said.Regulators in China have a wide scope for denying deals by American buyers, even if Chinese companies aren\u2019t involved. Chinese officials can block a deal for any new venture that they deem would have too much market control in China. The country\u2019s broadly defined antimonopoly law allows regulators to consider more than what an individual deal might cost consumers or a specific Chinese business.\u201cAuthorities are obliged to consider not just the competition merits of a deal but also the impact of a deal on China\u2019s national economy,\u201d said Ms. Zhou, a former official at the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, which until recently was in charge of greenlighting deals.United Technologies said it was still on track with regulatory approvals needed for its Rockwell Collins deal. But when asked on a conference call in June whether the trade war could prevent the deal from going through, Akhil Johri, United Technology\u2019s chief financial officer said, \u201cThat is something you always have to think about or worry about.\u201dLast Monday, United Technologies received a green light from regulators in the United States. \u201cThe process for closing on Rockwell Collins is moving forward with the recent U.S. Department of Justice approval being the latest milestone,\u201d said Michele Quintaglie, a spokeswoman for United Technologies. China\u2019s approval is the last step.The Disney-Fox and United Technologies-Rockwell Collins deals may be less likely to attract scrutiny because they aren\u2019t as central to Chinese business as Qualcomm. The chip maker supplied essential parts for the country\u2019s big smartphone manufacturers.It is unclear whether the Chinese authorities will scrutinize the Disney-Fox deal in particular, but experts said a deep review would be consistent with traditionally tight regulatory controls over foreign content and information.\u201cThe party has been more interested in containing American influence in the cultural space and entertainment space,\u201d Mr. Chen, of the Asia Global Institute, said. \u201cBlocking such a deal would serve to keep the American influence away and also make a point to America.\u201dCao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Barbara Kingsolver\u2019s New Novel Moves Between the Distant Past and the Troubled Present", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBooks of The TimesBarbara Kingsolver\u2019s plump new novel, \u201cUnsheltered,\u201d is about writers and academics, past and present, who can\u2019t hammer a nail. They live in old New Jersey houses that are crumbling.Life pinches them in other ways. This book\u2019s central character, a laid-off journalist named Willa Knox, asks this question: \u201cHow could two hardworking people do everything right in life and arrive in their 50s essentially destitute?\u201dWe meet Willa\u2019s family, four generations living under one sagging roof in Vineland, N.J. Their story is threaded with that of an intellectually daring science teacher who lived on the same property with his extended family, in a different collapsing house, a century earlier.\u201cUnsheltered,\u201d Kingsolver\u2019s eighth novel and her first in six years, would seem to have a lot going for it. It\u2019s got a ripe theme for Kingsolver, an unabashedly political writer, to pluck \u2014 that is, how poverty looms today for so many middle-class families, just around the corner, one misstep away.This book also offers, at times, the easygoing pleasures of Kingsolver\u2019s voice. When she\u2019s on, reading her sentences is like walking on crunchy leaves; her writing can be acute and funny. \u201cTo please their beloveds some women faked orgasm,\u201d Kingsolver writes. \u201cWilla faked composure.\u201dYet \u201cUnsheltered\u201d is dead on arrival. The historical sections are delivered in starchily ornate prose (\u201cYuletide garlands appeared to perspire in the gaslights\u201d) that reeks of orange rinds, rose petals and cinnamon sticks. You may feel you\u2019ve wandered into the gift shop at a Cracker Barrel.In the present-day sections, every other conversation threatens to become an op-ed piece or a humanistic monologue out of lesser John Steinbeck or Arthur Miller.In a typical commentary, Willa says (the ellipses are Kingsolver\u2019s): \u201cIt just seems like \u2026 I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s less money in the world than there used to be. I don\u2019t know how else to put it. Like something\u2019s broken.\u201dLines like these alternate with fact-heavy exposition. Willa\u2019s son, Zeke, a Harvard Business School graduate, is shuffled onstage carrying conversational bricks like these: \u201cPer capita G.D.P. in the U.S. has been pretty stagnant, Dad. You know that, right? Income used to be tied to productivity of the economy but that hasn\u2019t been true since 1978.\u201dThere\u2019s a lot of Barbara Ehrenreich, of the crusading journalist, in Kingsolver. She lives to afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted, a good sign in any writer. But a novel isn\u2019t an essay. Kingsolver\u2019s politics, in this case, sit on the chest of her fiction and asphyxiate it.Among the topics \u201cUnsheltered\u201d picks up and carries around for a while: health care exchanges, global warming, fair-hiring laws, Park Service budget cuts, the history of investment activism, college admissions and international trade.At some point even the humor begins to fizzle. A conversation about political science, poli-sci, contains this line: \u201cI always hated the sound of that. Polly Sigh. It sounds like mass hysteria in a sorority house.\u201d It does?A lot happens in \u201cUnsheltered.\u201d There\u2019s a suicide, a murder, a public forum that resembles the so-called Scopes Monkey Trial and a lost pregnancy, just for starters. But the book has a tempered emotional vibe. Its pressure isobars are spaced far apart; there is little wind speed.Willa and her husband, a handsome and gregarious academic who never quite made it, live with his disabled father, Nick, a Trump-loving talk radio nut. After Zeke\u2019s wife commits suicide, Zeke\u2019s baby son comes to live with them as well. (Zeke returns to his job in Boston.) Rounding out this unit is Antigone, or Tig, Willa\u2019s freewheeling 26-year-old daughter, just back from many months in Cuba.Kingsolver is at her best when writing about the interactions of these big personalities. She has a good feel for human stuff, for the messes we make and how we clean them up. An unexpected love story develops between Tig and Jorge, a mechanic and line cook who lives next door.We witness Mary\u2019s observations of and experiments with tarantulas and Venus flytraps, and her travels in New Jersey\u2019s Pine Barrens. A nascent love story develops between her and Thatcher, who is married to the wrong woman. (She\u2019s too stuck-up to appreciate oysters, a sign of bad character and grounds enough for divorce, in this reader\u2019s opinion.)Mary and Thatcher are both admirers of Darwin. Thatcher must fight off, in public, accusations that in teaching his students Darwin\u2019s ideas he is peddling indecency. Kingsolver also works in a 19th-century version of an alternative weekly newspaper, of a sort, to liven up discussion in Vineland. Its editor is murdered for his inquiring habits of mind.These historical sections, overfilled with Kingsolver\u2019s research, stop this novel almost entirely. It\u2019s always a relief to get back to Willa, who is real, and harried, and mostly delightful.When Willa begins to dream aloud about finding reasonable comfort for her extended family, her daughter cracks, as if she\u2019s in a \u201cDoonesbury\u201d panel, \u201cUh-oh.

{"Headline": "Tencent Is Suffering a One-Two Punch From the Tech Stock Sell-Off", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsTencent is exposed to a double dose of pain as a global tech rout gathers pace.On Wednesday, United States technology stocks fell sharply. But even against that backdrop and a similar plight afflicting Chinese rivals, the Hong Kong-listed gaming giant Tencent stands apart. It has lost $230 billion of market value from its peak in January, which is magnified by fickle Chinese traders and its exposure to emerging markets.Investors have wiped out about 40 percent of the tech titan\u2019s market value so far this year: it is now worth $348 billion. That compares to the less than 30 percent declines suffered by its U.S.-listed Chinese rivals Alibaba and Baidu over the same period. Slowing earnings growth and an unforeseen regulatory crackdown on mobile games, Tencent\u2019s core business, by the Chinese government triggered the slump. But it has since snowballed amid escalating U.S.-China trade tensions and concerns of a slowing economy in the People\u2019s Republic.Tencent\u2019s listing location is one reason it is getting hit harder than other tech companies. Analysts at BNP Paribas believe that it\u2019s currently the top-selling name on the Stock Connect scheme linking mainland exchanges to Hong Kong, which allows investors in China to trade the company\u2019s shares. That means Tencent is exposed to flighty Chinese investors, who tend to be quicker than most to buy and sell, making the good times richer \u2014 and the bad times poorer.A capital flight is also playing a part. Tencent is the top company in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, with a 4.5 percent weighting. The index has slumped 14 percent this year, largely because of outflows from riskier markets as the U.S. Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy. By contrast, Alibaba\u2019s weighting in the index is 3.7 percent and Baidu\u2019s only 1.2 percent.Tencent has responded to its decline with share buybacks. The company has been stepping up repurchases, spending $100 million since September, according to filings. But the amount it has bought \u2014 just 0.03 percent of its shares outstanding \u2014 is too small to make a real difference. Tencent shares still trade at almost 26 times forward earnings, according to Refinitiv data, but the premium is narrowing to its top rival Alibaba at 23 times.If that closes, Tencent will have one more thing to worry about.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": null, "News": "\n          ADVERTISEMENT\n          \n        \nBy Carrie DuarteOver the past few years, changes in workforce trends and practices have accelerated significantly \u2013 more so than any time in recent memory. When Henry Ford installed the first assembly line more than 100 years ago and started mass producing automobiles, he inspired a generation of US companies and transformed industries. Today we\u2019re in for another dramatic shift, driven in part by three underlying forces poised to change the future of workforces and consequently how M&A deals are evaluated in the years ahead. First, the growth of the gig economy has given workers more flexibility to choose when and where they work, and will therefore change the relationship between workers and employers. Second, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies will likely automate many more workplace tasks, putting jobs in question and reshaping the kinds of work and skills that humans perform. Third, as the business case supporting a more diverse workforce grows, there are similarly meaningful deal risks and opportunities to consider.  Human capital will be critical for decades to come, and the forces expected to disrupt virtually every workplace means it is more important than ever that dealmakers have a rigorous workforce plan focused on the value of people \u2013 specifically, the two unique qualities they bring to business: skills and diversity. This will involve considering the needs of companies\u2019 future workforces and developing the appropriate strategies to respond, including asking what skills will be needed years from now and whether they will be developed in-house or bought or borrowed from third parties. Beyond workforce planning, understanding what plans and resources are in place to support upskilling efforts will also help companies remain competitive in markets that are continually changing.     If an acquirer buys a gig platform or a firm with a significant share of contingent workers, it will need to address some unique challenges, such as retaining those workers since they are not technically categorized as employees with all the benefits and protections that come with that status. Among the questions for dealmakers: How are companies setting themselves up to attract and keep gig workers? What positions are most likely to be gig versus full-time employees? How should companies manage the distinct risks of gig workers, including cybersecurity and intellectual property risks?Skills gap: What humans can uniquely master, but robots can\u2019tIndeed, human skills come at a premium. When it comes to adopting new technologies, it\u2019s not just about cutting costs. It\u2019s also aimed at boosting productivity \u2013 a goal that often gets lost when firms invest in digital labor without factoring how humans will play a role.For instance, US banks in recent years have invested in new technologies to automate and digitize work done in back offices, since digital labor is relatively less costly than US domestic staff. Robots can also operate 24/7 and don\u2019t take sick days. However, companies risk seeing lower returns if they overlook the human skills needed to manage and maintain the machines. Companies that are most successful at adopting and adapting to new technologies prioritize workforce training and upskilling. At a recent PwC conference in New York City, futurist and author Tim O\u2019Reilly underscored this notion. \u201cWhat great companies teach us is that technology is a talent additive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt actually improves the capabilities of your people.\u201dFrom a deals perspective, organizations can start uncovering the risks and opportunities of digital labor by forming a deeper understanding of the skills of their workforce and by asking key questions: How prepared is the workforce in adopting new technologies? Has the organization assessed the workforce\u2019s digital IQ? Is there a strategy around which employees will receive digital upskilling? Will the firm\u2019s digital strategy come from top executives, or will employees working directly with new tools drive the strategy? Will the firm encourage employees to try new things and accept a healthy level of failure?   Diversity: A spectrum of perspectives lead to better outcomesSkills are just one part of the equation. The diversity of a company\u2019s workforce, including the spectrum of experiences, perspectives and backgrounds that employees bring, also influences a company\u2019s value in the marketplace. More than that, diversity shapes an organization\u2019s reputation and ability to retain and attract not only talent, but customers as well.Today most dealmakers are thinking about soaring valuations and whether the price of their next M&A will be worth it. No doubt these are very real concerns, but it\u2019s worth taking a step back and assessing the underlying trends likely to influence deals. The complexities changing the dynamics of the workforce are bound to transpire in the deals investors consider.

{"Headline": "What\u2019s in a Name Change? For Those Saying U.S.M.C.A., a Mouthful", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump has long wielded the word \u201cNafta\u201d like an epithet, deriding the North American Free Trade Agreement as the worst trade deal in history.So when he renamed it the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2014 or U.S.M.C.A. \u2014 this week, he may have short-circuited attempts to criticize the new deal. Why? Because the name itself is really hard to say.Even Mr. Trump, who bills himself as a master brander, appeared to grasp that U.S.M.C.A. was not as smooth as Nafta, saying on Monday that people would make use of the new term \u201c99 percent\u201d of the time. At an event in Philadelphia on Tuesday he poked fun at the name, arguing that it had to be changed because Nafta was so bad for the country.He is largely alone. While reviews of the trade deal itself are still coming in, the name itself has gotten a resounding thumbs down.Top Trump administration officials have stumbled over the agreement\u2019s shorthand, which linguists say is tricky to verbalize because it is an initialism rather than an acronym, like Nafta, which slides off the lips like a word.Speaking to reporters outside the White House on Tuesday, Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, made clear that he was still coming to terms with the new name while espousing its many virtues.Almost.In a CNN interview on Tuesday morning, Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, was blitzing through Mr. Trump\u2019s accomplishments on trade when he called the pact with Canada and Mexico \u201cthis new Nafta version,\u201d before wincing and correcting himself: \u201cthe U.S.M.C.A.\u201dGetting there could take practice, and in some cases, avoidance has been the preferred strategy. Peter Navarro, one of Mr. Trump\u2019s top trade advisers and one of Nafta\u2019s fiercest critics, seemed to dance around the issue while taking questions on NPR on Tuesday morning, safely referring to the new agreement as \u201cthe deal.\u201dEven Robert Lighthizer, the lead trade negotiator who spent more than a year brokering the new trade deal, referred to it as Nafta during a briefing with reporters on Monday afternoon.For Mr. Trump, renaming Nafta was nearly as important as rewriting it. He spent years lashing out at the agreement and promising to scrap it, so giving it a new title was a critical part of ensuring his promise was kept.It remains unclear whether the new name will take. On social media, critics of Mr. Trump have sneered at the name and some have suggested sticking to Nafta or amending it with a \u201c2.0\u201d to spite the president.Dean Crutchfield, a branding and marketing strategist in New York, said that since the name was officially being changed in the text, it would probably take hold, as long as the news media used it.\u201cI think the more people see it, the more they will get accustomed to it,\u201d Mr. Crutchfield said.But that does not mean it will be embraced. According to Grover Hudson, an emeritus linguistics professor at Michigan State University, initialisms \u2014 which do not read as words \u2014 are easier to digest for shorter abbreviations. But long strings of words, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, set off a desire for a convenient shorthand. Imagine if \u201cscuba\u201d \u2014 short for \u201cself-contained underwater breathing apparatus\u201d \u2014 were scrambled, he mused.\u201cIt\u2019s typical of Trump\u2019s decisions in that you get something that\u2019s not terribly better than what it replaced and worse in many ways,\u201d Mr. Hudson said. \u201cHe wanted to have something new that he could claim was his, but all he could come up with was U.S.M.C.A.\u201dTo trade experts, the new name was a minor annoyance dwarfed by huge relief that a trade deal had been reached.\u201cIt is somewhat comforting to see that one of the worst things you can say about U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement is that the new trade agreement replaces a term that everyone knows and can say with an unpronounceable acronym,\u201d said William Alan Reinsch, a trade specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cHow do you say U.S.M.C.A.? Even Nafta 2.0 would sound better.\u201dThe alphabet soup of an abbreviation could come with some benefits. It captures the essence of Mr. Trump\u2019s governing philosophy of America on top, while being difficult to attack.\u201cThis accomplishes Trump\u2019s goal of putting America first, at least in name even if not in terms of the country\u2019s long-term interests,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, a trade policy professor at Cornell University. \u201cThis is hardly an abbreviation that rolls off the tongue, so at least no future president will be able to refer to it mockingly and derisively as Trump did with Nafta.\u201dLike Nafta, the future of the U.S.M.C.A. will ultimately depend on the agreement\u2019s effect on the economies of North America.\u201cNafta became a bad name because it led to a bad result,\u201d Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said in an interview.While Mr. Levin is optimistic that Mr. Trump\u2019s new pact could be a step in the right direction, he acknowledged that shaking the old name could be a challenge.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard not to use the word Nafta,\u201d he said.If the leaders who drafted the deal are committed to using it, however, it has a better chance of taking hold.Chrystia Freeland, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, signaled that she was fully on board with both the agreement and its name.\u201cYes, we do have to call it U.S.M.C.A.,\u201d Ms. Freeland told a skeptical interviewer on CBC Radio on Tuesday. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is.\u201dQuoting Shakespeare to underscore that substance is more important than style, Ms. Freeland said, \"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "With \u2018Fishy\u2019 Jet Deal, India\u2019s Opposition Finally Lands a Blow on Modi", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Modi was also quick to accuse the rival Congress Party, India\u2019s longstanding political dynasty, of lavish spending and crony capitalism.But in the past few weeks, the role of accuser has been dramatically reversed.The Congress Party, which had seemed anemic since Mr. Modi\u2019s election, has found a new spring in its step by hounding the prime minister over an opaque arms deal that has raised some serious questions.Why did Mr. Modi renegotiate a deal for 36 fighter jets?Why was a company run by members of one of India\u2019s wealthiest families chosen to participate in the deal, despite having no experience building jets?Why did the costs of the planes seem to jump so much?And why isn\u2019t Mr. Modi sharing more details?For several years, Indian politics have been dominated by Mr. Modi\u2019s party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., which has grown accustomed to pushing around its rivals.But for the first time in a long time, the opposition, by building a damaging narrative around this arms deal, has landed a solid punch, and is hoping to keep the pressure on Mr. Modi and his party ahead of next year\u2019s general election.Congress Party officials have dominated headlines and social media with their accusations that Mr. Modi inflated the price of the aircraft, estimated to cost $8.7 billion, and brought in a trusted ally on the deal so his political party could get something back in return.\u201cWe smell something fishy,\u201d said Jaiveer Shergill, a Congress Party spokesman.The story of the jets starts in 2015, when Mr. Modi, on a visit to Paris, proudly announced that he had struck a deal with the French to buy three dozen supersonic Rafale fighter planes. The surprise wasn\u2019t the French partner, Dassault Aviation, maker of the storied Mirage.What raised eyebrows was a new twist in the deal announced more than a year later. The arrangement included what is called an offset contract in which the French, in return for selling India billions of dollars of planes, would invest in India and help Indian companies build aerospace components.The lead partner chosen for the offset contract was the Reliance Group, a conglomerate run by members of the Ambani family, one of India\u2019s richest and most ostentatious. While Reliance has long been involved in manufacturing and has billions of dollars in capital, it has no experience making jets. And the Ambanis are known to be strong Modi supporters.The former French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, added to the controversy surrounding the deal when he said recently that the Modi government had specifically proposed the Ambani-owned company for the offset contract.So opposition politicians have seized on this jet deal with an almost desperate glee.Reliance will make an \u201cunwarranted, escalated profit,\u2019\u2019 said Mr. Shergill, the Congress Party spokesman. \u201cHow much of a share is the B.J.P. getting out of that profit?\u201dWith these accusations swirling around him, Mr. Modi has gone with his usual response: silence.Rather than speaking out himself, he has deputized party officials and ministers to fend off claims of a quid pro quo between the governing party and Reliance Group. His stand-ins have argued that the details of the agreement, including how the price was set and why Reliance was selected, cannot be revealed because of the contract\u2019s \u201csecrecy clause.\u201dAnalysts say the strategy isn\u2019t working.\u201cThis is a persistent problem with this government,\u201d said Milan Vaishnav, the director of the South Asia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cYou have no clear spokesperson with the prime minister\u2019s office, you have no media adviser. I think on many of these issues they often come across as flat-footed or disorganized.\u201dUntil the backlash over the jet deal, Mr. Modi had seemed to float above the most serious allegations against his administration or political party. A shrewd steward of his image, he would draw on his personal story of being the son of a tea seller, a devout Hindu and a prime minister who lives simply.Now, Mr. Vaishnav said, the opposition can say about Mr. Modi: \u201cYou\u2019re just like anybody else.\u201dAn official with Dassault Aviation said in an email that the company chose \u201cour partners freely without pressure from the Indian government.\u201dSupporters of Mr. Modi argue that the Reliance Group, a conglomerate with thousands of employees and experience working on big infrastructure projects, isn\u2019t such an odd choice as a partner to the deal.A Reliance spokesperson said that other Indian companies with little track record in defense manufacturing had also jumped into the sector and that this controversy was a \u201cnonissue\u201d stirred up by corporate rivalries.India\u2019s original plan was to buy 126 Rafale jets, with a large portion of them built in India, for less than $100 million per jet, according to figures provided by Congress Party officials, whose leaders negotiated the first rounds of the deal when they were in power several years ago.That figure has been contested by defenders of the deal, who say its total price also includes missiles, spare parts and other costs \u2014 more than just the planes themselves, which they say individually cost a little more than $100 million each.One point on which there is widespread agreement: India\u2019s need to update its aging fighter jets. India aspires to be able to wage a two-front war, but analysts say its current air force would be annihilated by a simultaneous attack from China and Pakistan, India\u2019s regional rivals.While voters may find the murky affair hard to follow, the opposition is likely to do all it can to make sure people don\u2019t forget.\u201cThis is all about optics,\u201d said Harsh V. Pant, an international relations professor at King\u2019s College in London.\u201cIt\u2019s not about bringing anyone to justice or doing anything for the greater good,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the 2019 election.\u201dEmma Bubola contributed reporting from Paris, and Hari Kumar from New Delhi.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Bigger Seats, Better Service? Nope. But Airlines Are Offering Cool Pretzels. ", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTo up their hip quotient, companies are offering snacks from small, local producers as an inexpensive way of breeding loyalty with passengers. Pretzel Perfection was a little-known company producing 100,000 bags of gluten-free pretzels a month when it made its debut on Delta flights in 2017. Now, the brand, which Amy Holyk, then a stay-at-home mother, started out of her garage in Vancouver, Wa., turns out more than 8 million bags of pretzels and snack mixes a month and had $16 million in revenues last year. Brian Berry, Delta\u2019s director of onboard services strategic planning, said that after passengers said in surveys in 2016 that they wanted better snacks in economy, the company branched out.  \u201cWe wanted to be on trend with our snack choices, and we think that smaller, specialty brands are definitely on trend,\u201d he said.Yes, in recent years, carriers including Delta, United Airlines, American Airlines and JetBlue have begun serving passengers food and drinks from start-up companies.This spring, United started serving Wheatley Vodka, which is distilled in small batches in Frankfort. Ky., in both economy, where it\u2019s available for purchase, and business class, where it\u2019s free. Also, in July, the airline started serving bags of maple wafers from Byrd\u2019s Cookie Company, a fourth-generation, family-owned enterprise from Savannah, Ga., as its free economy class snack on morning flights. American Airlines will start serving snacks from Lorissa\u2019s Kitchen, a maker of grass-fed beef jerky, in November (free in business class; for sale in coach) and it will also be selling items from Zoe\u2019s Kitchen, a Dallas-Fort Worth company that prides itself on its made-from-scratch Mediterranean dishes. The choices will include the Gruben sandwich, a combination of turkey, manchego cheese, slaw and feta spread on marble bread.JetBlue is so dedicated to supporting tiny food brands that it offers a mentoring program called BlueBud where companies work with its onboard food and beverage team to learn what it takes to supply products to an airline. They\u2019re not guaranteed placement on JetBlue, but Sophia Mendelsohn, head of sustainability, environmental and social governance, said that the point is to set up the budding entrepreneurs for success. In the skies, the airline has numerous options from niche food companies, varying by route. In Mint, its business class cabin, for example, passengers can eat ice-cream from local producers. Flights departing from Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., between October and December are stocked with a \u201cchocolate decadence\u201d flavor from the Miami Beach company, The Frieze, while flights leaving Los Angeles during these months can choose \u201cbananas foster\u201d from Coolhaus. Byrd\u2019s, the cookie company whose products were picked up United, was making 200 million cookies a year before the airline started offering them. \u201cWe now make 1.9 billion of them a year,\u201d said Geoff Repella, Byrd\u2019s president. The thin and crispy wafers are made with brown sugar and maple syrup and are a variation on a recipe from the South that Mr. Repella said dates back more than 300 years. \u201cOur relationship with United has been a game changer for us,\u201d he said. \u201cI get more than 20 calls and 40 emails a day from customers who want to buy our cookies.\u201d But it\u2019s not always easy to ramp up a small business to meet airlines\u2019 needs. Only one company that completed JetBlue\u2019s BlueBud program has had its wares accepted for onboard service: Hot Bread Kitchen, whose challah rolls were part of the brunch menu in Mint class.\u201cMany of the companies haven\u2019t been quite ready to offer their products on such a large scale,\u201d said Tamara Young, a JetBlue spokeswoman.But that would cost money, and providing hipper snacks is relatively cheap.  Zach Honig, the editor at large of the travel site The Points Guy, said offering cooler snacks is a win-win for everyone involved because they\u2019re more likely to be loyal to the airline while the brands get propelled into the big leagues.\u201dMr. Honig said that he is a frequent traveler on United and said that he fell in love with the Shelia G\u2019s brownie brittle that used to be in its first class snack basket. \u201cIt was the first thing to go so I would rush to grab it,\u201d he said. \u201cI even ordered a case for home. When you\u2019re trapped on an aircraft, food is one of the biggest sources of excitement.\u201d Advertisement"}

On the other hand, Mr. Trump\u2019s relatively low approval ratings have persisted through a humming economy since the start of his presidency, so it\u2019s possible the latest news will change few minds.\u2022 With officials in both parties seeing Democrats holding an edge in the race for the House, Republicans are spending more money than they\u2019d like defending open seats that were once reliably red.Now the well-funded group, called C.L.F. in the lingo of Washington, is going to do the same in Florida\u2019s 15th District, where Ross Spano, a Republican, is facing Kristen Carlson, the Democratic choice. It is rushing $2 million in advertising to rescue the Lakeland-to-Tampa seat.That is a significant sum of new money to put down this late for a single House district, especially one that President Trump carried by 10 points \u2014 and in a year when Republicans have been left to defend dozens of lawmakers across the country in the hopes of salvaging some fraction of their current majority. (Republicans can afford to lose no more than 22 seats this fall if they want to keep the House.)Putting down seven figures in a pricey media market like Tampa may only prove to be a precautionary move, but it\u2019s already a win of sorts for Democrats: That\u2019s money that won\u2019t be directed toward even more competitive races.\u2022 On the Senate side, it\u2019s the Democrats spending more than they\u2019d hoped on a race that should be far from their minds by now.But the consistently closer-than-comfortable polling in the New Jersey race could not be ignored. Senate Majority PAC, the principal super PAC aligned with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, announced it was making an additional investment of $2.8 million into the race \u2014 weeks after pouring in $3 million to help its scandal-plagued incumbent, Senator Bob Menendez. (Mr. Menendez\u2019s trial on federal corruption charges ended in a hung jury.)Mr. Hugin, a former pharmaceutical executive, added another $3.5 million of his own money last week, bringing his personal investment in the race to $27.5 million.Political momentum has been with the Republican candidates lately in several hard-fought Senate races. For Democrats, the idea of losing the New Jersey seat \u2014 especially if they turn things around and have a shot at winning the majority on Election Day \u2014 is too much to stomach.\u2022 There were no knockout lines or moments Thursday in the final debate between Senator Claire McCaskill, a two-term Democrat of Missouri, and her challenger, Josh Hawley, the Republican state attorney general.\u2022 They disagreed on just about everything, as you\u2019d expect, though they both advocated health care protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Ms. McCaskill is running hard on the issue, and arguing that Mr. Hawley would undo the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections, while Mr. Hawley is pushing for alternatives and accusing Ms. McCaskill of \u201cscare tactics.\u201d\u2022 With President Trump expected to return to Missouri \u2014 a state he carried by 19 points \u2014 to campaign for Mr. Hawley, Ms. McCaskill noted that she had voted with the president on issues 50 percent of the time. But she also had choice words about his character: \u201cJust lie after lie after lie.\u201d\u2022 Public polling shows a tight race.

{"Headline": "Tech Drove Stocks Skyward. It Was a Different Story on the Way Down.", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLarge technology companies, and the big profits they produce, lifted the markets earlier this year. But during October\u2019s tumble they were only part of a broad-based downturn. The world\u2019s largest technology companies drove the stock market to record highs earlier this year. As stocks have tumbled, though, it\u2019s more like they\u2019re just along for the ride.Unlike the rally, the rout that started in late September and dominated trading in October was a broad-based affair. That suggests that investors are less concerned that the tech giants\u2019 shares rose too far too fast, and are instead worried about the fundamentals of the United States economy and the continuing profitability of companies of all kinds.October was particularly painful for investors. At its worst, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down more than 9 percent during the month. A late charge took some of the sharp edge off: The S.&P. 500 was up around 1 percent on Wednesday, its second straight gain, helping to cut losses for the month to around 7 percent. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that\u2019s bothering the markets and I think it\u2019s fears about earnings estimates,\u201d said Randy Watts, chief investment strategist with the investment advisory firm William O\u2019Neil & Company. And only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. There are plenty of factors worrying investors: President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.\u201cDespite the fact that earnings are exceptional by any objective measure, investors are concerned that they will slow more dramatically than expected next year,\u201d said Jason DeSena Trennert, managing partner at Strategas Research Partners, a markets and economic analysis firm. The tech companies\u2019 declines are not minor, but they are not big enough to signal that investors are overly concerned about the health of the stocks that fueled so much of the gains of the past decade.

{"Headline": "A Top Indian Minister Resigns, but Can #MeToo Reform Government?", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNEW DELHI \u2014 An Indian cabinet minister quit on Wednesday after 21 women came forward to accuse him of sexual harassment, making him the most prominent figure so far to be felled by the #MeToo movement sweeping the world\u2019s largest democracy.The minister, M.J. Akbar, said he was stepping down to fight his accusers in court. On Thursday, an Indian court will hear the defamation case that Mr. Akbar and his 97 lawyers have brought against Priya Ramani, the first woman to publicly accuse him of harassment dating back to a time when he was a prominent newspaper editor.Indian women are now facing their toughest battle yet, demanding accountability from the highest echelon of male power: the government.\u201cAs women, we feel vindicated by M.J. Akbar\u2019s resignation,\u201d Ms. Ramani said in a tweet. \u201cI look forward to the day when I will also get justice in court #metoo.\u201dPrime Minister Narendra Modi has cast himself as a champion of women, funding more social welfare programs for women and lengthening sentences for rapists. But there have also been disappointments for female voters.Even supporters of Mr. Modi have faced difficulties pursuing cases against powerful members of his party. In Bangalore, a popular right-wing social media commentator, Sonam Mahajan, has spent the past year pursuing a sexual harassment claim against a top aide of Rajeev Chandrasekhar, a business magnate and ruling party lawmaker.After an internal investigation found him guilty of harassment, the aide used Mr. Chandrasekhar\u2019s lawyer to get a judge to impose a gag order preventing Ms. Mahajan from talking about the findings or filing charges with the police.Mr. Akbar \u201ccontinues to enjoy enormous power and privilege as minister and member of Parliament,\u201d their letter read. \u201cWhen Ms. Ramani spoke out against him in public, she spoke not only about her personal experience but also lifted the lid on the culture of casual misogyny, entitlement and sexual predation that Mr. Akbar engendered and presided over.\u201dOne female journalist said Mr. Akbar began their meeting by answering the door in his underwear. Another said he repeatedly grabbed her in the office and forced his tongue against her pursed lips.At the time, the minister\u2019s accusers were all young women newly out of university. Now some of them are among India\u2019s most powerful women, heading the newsrooms of three English-language newspapers in the country and working internationally at major outlets like CNN and The New York Times.On Thursday, India\u2019s courts will decide whether to hear the testimony of those women. Mr. Akbar, who was appointed minister of state for external affairs in 2016, began his journalism career in 1971, rising to become one of the nation\u2019s most influential editors.This week, the Indian government declined to comment on the allegations against Mr. Akbar, saying that they were \u201cpersonal and stem from his time before he entered government.\u201dCriticism mounted as Mr. Modi, who faces re-election in 2019, stayed silent.When his party swept national elections in 2014, he promised economic growth and social progression for all and more women-centric welfare programs. Despite some reforms, Mr. Modi has failed to empower and encourage more women to enter the work force \u2014 a goal that is important to achieving a robust economy\u201cWhen we looked at women managers, one of the things that was obvious was that whenever they faced harassment, they went back home or their home pulled them back,\u201d said Ranjana Kumari, the director of the Center for Social Research, a Delhi-based think tank.The question is whether the current #MeToo movement can improve the lot of women across India and make workplaces safer, or whether the efforts will peter out as attention fades and the inevitable backlash from India\u2019s patriarchal culture sets in.Rather than representing independence, she said, the office became \u201ca torture chamber, I was desperate to get out of, but couldn\u2019t find the door.\u201dMaking public accusations of sexual harassment against government officials is challenging because political figures have influence at many levels of the state in India, including in the courts.Ms. Mahajan, the commentator and television personality hired by the office of Mr. Chandrasekhar, the member of parliament, learned that the hard way. Shortly after her appointment a year ago, she has alleged, it became obvious to her that the man who hired her, Mr. Chandrasekhar\u2019s chief of staff, Abhinav Khare, was interested in more than her knack for making pro-Hindu posts go viral.Ms. Mahajan filed a sexual harassment complaint against Mr. Khare. After a lengthy internal investigation, the employer found him guilty of harassment, she said in a series of tweets.But Mr. Khare recently went to court and, without a hearing or advance warning to her, obtained an order preventing her and her former employer from discussing the case. Mr. Khare said in an email that Ms. Mahajan\u2019s claims were false and came as he was about to fire her for poor performance.A spokesman for Mr. Chandrasekhar said that Ms. Mahajan had received swift and fair justice and that \u201cMr. Chandrasekhar supports the women who have come out bravely to take on their tormentors and believes they deserve their justice.\u201dMaria Abi-Habib reported from New Delhi, and Vindu Goel from Mumbai, India.

That isn\u2019t just a description of Saudi Arabia: it also applies to Qatar.Until recently, asset managers, start-ups and governments were all attracted to Saudi Arabia by such an impressive list of features. The kingdom invested $45 billion into SoftBank\u2019s Vision Fund and $20 billion in a Blackstone infrastructure fund.But with Riyadh\u2019s reputation now tarnished following the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Qatar may be the best alternative.Pivoting to Doha isn\u2019t as strange as it sounds. True, in June 2017 the small desert peninsula was blockaded by Bahrain, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia for a litany of alleged sins, which precipitated a $30 billion nonresident funding exodus from its banking system. But Qatar switched trading partners and placed $40 billion of reserves and overseas deposits from its central bank and sovereign wealth fund into its lenders. Already $16 billion of that has been refinanced by Asian and European banks and investors, according to the credit rating agency Fitch.Assuming that Qatar can refinance the rest \u2014 which should be easier, given the nation has a potential 4.7 percent budget surplus in 2018 over last year\u2019s 2.9 percent deficit \u2014 it would have $40 billion of spare cash. If it was feeling ambitious, it could leverage that and turn itself into a Vision Fund-scale investor.The Qatar Investment Authority tends to be rather more conservative, but that might not matter. Doha\u2019s increase of liquefied natural gas production, to 110 million tonnes by 2024 from 77 million tonnes this year, could create an extra $40 billion of revenue. With annual capital investment expected to halve from around $27 billion before the 2022 soccer World Cup, which the country , will host the Q.I.A. could soon pack serious firepower.Rather than invest in lavish Saudi-style projects like the megacity Neom, Qatar could invest in steady infrastructure assets \u2014 around Africa, for example, maybe partnering with Chinese entities. Or it could look to turn itself into a hub for gas and energy technology.But Vision Fund-style tech investment is at least feasible. And Qatar\u2019s more enlightened social policies and approach to press freedoms might endear it to more discerning American and European start-ups or municipalities seeking capital. Maybe next year investors will head to Doha instead.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "As Merkel Eyes Exit, Nervous E.U. Wonders Who\u2019ll Take the Stage", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 The European stage Angela Merkel commanded for so long and so effectively may be cracking, if not collapsing. She has been the poster woman for Europe\u2019s democratic center, but the center is imploding. She and Germany have been a symbol of stability, but now even Germany is seen as politically unstable.Ms. Merkel may be becoming more unpopular at home, and her influence over others may be waning. But to those who believed \u2014 and worked for \u2014 the dream of an ever-closer union, Ms. Merkel was considered fundamentally reliable, decent and committed to Europe and its values. She stood as a bulwark against the strutting populists who now run countries as varied as Italy, Hungary and Poland.What Europe will do without Ms. Merkel is no small question, especially when nationalism is rising and Europe\u2019s politics seem to be reorganized not along the usual left-right spectrum, but rather around who is for Europe, and who is against it.\u201cShe provided the sense that someone was in control and could be counted on,\u201d said Jan Techau, the Berlin-based director of the Europe program for the German Marshall Fund. \u201cShe gave the assurance that Germany was the reserve power in Europe on which you could depend. While she made mistakes, you could rely on Merkel even if you didn\u2019t like her.\u201dWho can act as a counterbalance to the forces tearing at the bloc\u2019s unity in her eventual absence \u2014 Ms. Merkel has said she would finish her term that ends in 2021, though that seems doubtful \u2014 is suddenly an urgent discussion.Tomas Valasek, the director of Carnegie Europe, said that Ms. Merkel \u201ccreated European consensus out of nothing,\u201d and everyone wonders, \u201cMy God, who will do the job for her?\u201dThe problem for Mr. Macron was, and remains, that he is not strong enough on his own to push through his ambitious vision of \u2018\u2018more Europe.\u2019\u2019 He needs German support.On paper Ms. Merkel has committed to support some of Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas for eurozone reform and his call for a new start in Europe. If she was lukewarm to some of his other proposals \u2014 like the idea of empowering a European finance minister \u2014 Ms. Merkel did at least provide a reasonably like-minded partner at the core of Europe.Any Merkel successor is unlikely to be any more supportive of Mr. Macron\u2019s ideas, and will have a lot less stature in Brussels than the chancellor has earned after what have been some 102 European summit meetings since she took power in 2005.In any case, the rest of this year will see little progress, notes Josef Janning of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Berlin, because \u201cshe\u2019s a very lame duck until a new party leader is elected, without carte blanche to move in Europe.\u201dAll of that portends badly for buttressing European Union machinery that could help the bloc head off another financial crisis, or at least weather one. \u201c2018 was supposed to be the year of reform,\u201d Mr. Janning said. \u201cBut nothing much has happened except trying to solve one crisis after another.\u201dMs. Merkel\u2019s failure to do more in all these years to secure the institutional future of the euro will be a lasting mark against her, Mr. Techau believes.While a reluctant leader, Ms. Merkel has provided a dignified but firm response to both President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and to President Trump, who have both tried to provoke her.Some European leaders, of course, will be glad to see her go. Ms. Merkel\u2019s critics note that her hard line on enforcing austerity during the financial crisis and her decision to let a million migrants into Germany may have helped fuel the populist backlash that is now Europe\u2019s biggest challenge.The Polish politician Jaroslaw Kaczynski has demonized the German chancellor over the migration issue and her support for the Nordstream II pipeline from Russia, and the Greeks blamed her for all but strangling their country financially.Hungary\u2019s prime minister, Viktor Orban, has set himself up as the anti-Merkel for European elections in May, and along with the new Italian populist leaders, has been critical of the sanctions on Russia but has so far not blocked their renewal.All the countries of Central Europe were opposed to Ms. Merkel\u2019s initial welcome of refugees and migrants and her efforts to spread them around. But as Mr. Valasek, the Carnegie Europe director, points out, the Czechs and Slovaks appreciate her financial rigor, and German investment in Central Europe has been crucial to the region\u2019s economy.Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin may be glad when she goes, as well.Mr. Trump has always had issues with Germany, especially over trade and the German devotion to multilateralism. \u201cBut with Merkel it seems to be worse, almost personal, the way she avoids open confrontation and sticks to her principles,\u201d Mr. Valasek said.\u2018Mr. Trump,\u201d he said, \u201cwill be relieved, but the fundamentals of the relationship won\u2019t change. And I think Putin will be delighted. The staying power of the sanctions against Russia were her personal triumph.\u201dThere will be continuing uncertainty as to how long Ms. Merkel will be able to continue as chancellor, despite her strong wish, as Mr. Janning said, \u201cto hand over the job to someone who has won it in an election.\u201d Ms. Merkel, who ran only reluctantly for a fourth term after the election of Mr. Trump, \u201cwill hand it over in dignity to an elected successor and not be pushed out by her party,\u201d he said.But new elections could come faster than she now expects.\u201cWith her departure,\u201d he wrote, \u201ca politician is leaving who had the ability to speak at eye level with Presidents Xi, Trump and Putin, and always represented the position of the E.U. It will take time before her successor reaches such standing.\u201dThere are worries about Ms. Merkel\u2019s position, somewhat thrust upon her, as the defender of Western values and the international order, especially in the face of the challenges from Mr. Trump, Mr. Putin and the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. Those were expressed in a Twitter message by Richard N. Haass, head of the American Council on Foreign Relations.\u201cThe Merkel era is close to ending, leaving the West and the post-WW2 int\u2019l order w/o a leader,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe US of @realDonaldTrump has abdicated. The UK is distracted. Canada lacks means. Macron is too weak. Bodes poorly for stability, prosperity, freedom.\u201dBut Ms. Merkel has been badly weakened, too. And as Mr. Valasek suggests, her leaving office \u201cmay in fact take some steam out of the populist wave.\u201d\u201cThe zeitgeist is getting someone else in place,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s possible when the leader leaves who looms largest, since 2005, and represents the largest E.U. country, this might have salutary effect on the restlessness of the masses in getting out the elite no matter what.\u201dBut one thing seems sure. Ms. Merkel will not then take on a leading European role, Mr. Janning said.\u201cShe knows how ugly that game is and how little respect current presidents and prime ministers have for former leaders,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has no interest in being the assistant to self-seeking leaders.\u201dAdvertisement"}

If there were, say, five smaller social networks in place of Facebook, that would probably make the situation far worse, because each would be more vulnerable to attack, and when serious problems arose, it would be harder to track down the bad behavior and figure out how to thwart it.Instead, he argues that there\u2019s a bigger problem: \u201cWe haven\u2019t agreed on a set of goals for how social media should impact civil society.\u201d Before we rush to tear up Facebook, he writes, we should work out if social media can be changed to improve society \u2014 as happened to newspapers, radio and TV \u2014 by demanding more from the companies.Mr. Hoffman concedes, though, that his approach would mean \u201ca long and never-ending process.\u201dMr. Nordhaus was cited for his work on the implications of environmental factors, including climate change. Mr. Romer was cited for his work on the importance of technological change.It\u2019s all about market failure. Left alone, markets will generate too much pollution (Nordhaus) and too few ideas (Romer).Avoiding global warming is expensive. Dealing with the damage that it causes could be financially ruinous.To avoid that fate, the report urges huge transformations of the world economy in the next few years. That means taxing carbon dioxide emissions (perhaps as high as $27,000 per ton by 2100), investments in clean energy (of $2.4 trillion every year through 2035), and a complete end of coal use by 2050.But such swift and unified change is politically unlikely, especially with President Trump intending to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.Traditional Republican donors like Paul Singer are still giving money to the party, but others have broken rank. Seth Klarman, the hedge fund billionaire, plans to give $20 million to Democrats. Other financiers are backing obscure Democratic candidates for Congress.Some of Wall Street\u2019s Democratic supporters say they\u2019re driven by opposition to President Trump. Others see something else at work: \u201cThey just want to follow winners,\u201d the conservative economist Stephen Moore told the NYT.Take Jack Poulson, a research scientist alarmed by Google\u2019s efforts to build a censored search engine for China. He took his concerns to Jeff Dean, the tech giant\u2019s head of A.I. What happened, according to Kate Conger and Cade Metz of the NYT:According to Dr. Poulson, Mr. Dean said that Google complied with surveillance requests from the federal government and asked rhetorically if the company should leave the United States market in protest. Mr. Dean also shared a draft of a company email that read, \u201cWe won\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t provide 100 percent transparency to every Googler, to respect our commitments to customer confidentiality and giving our product teams the freedom to innovate.\u201dThe next day, Dr. Poulson quit.It may be hard for these tech giants to find replacements, as well. The NYT added that some students are asking similar questions \u2014 before they even join the work force.Mr. Ballmer\u2019s bottom line? \u201cStick with what you know. Or really dedicate yourself to learning something new.\u201dDealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading! We\u2019ll see you tomorrow.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Retraining Workers for New Jobs and New Lives After Prison and Addiction", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTony Simpson, an entrepreneurial engineer, had grown increasingly concerned about Campbell County, Tenn., where he grew up and still lived.Despite a reasonably solid manufacturing base, as well as scenic lakes and hills that attract tourists, the Appalachian region he calls home was beset by a depressed economy and high rates of incarceration, largely fueled by drug and alcohol addiction.Although he had a grueling travel schedule for his concrete restoration company, he began to volunteer as a jailhouse minister. \u201cI started spending time, one on one, with the prisoners. And what I heard, over and over again, is that \u2018when I get out of here, I\u2019m never coming back.\u2019\u201cBut what I saw is that they\u2019d cycle back in. They always had the same excuse \u2014 \u2018I can\u2019t get a job and the only place I have to live is the same place as I did before, which is full of drugs.\u2019\u201cI did this for about three years, and, about two years ago, felt God calling, to address this. And I started thinking about a program of how to offer these men training and a job.\u201dA few weeks ago, nearly 1,000 people turned out for an outdoor community barbecue of hamburgers, hot dogs and all the trimmings to mark what they hoped would be a turning point in the region\u2019s struggle because of efforts by Mr. Simpson and others.The common narrative tells a story of a region, long dependent on coal, that suffered economically when the demand dropped. That in turn, it is said, spurred a drug crisis among the jobless.But a more nuanced and more accurate view is that the decline in coal production and accompanying job loss coincided with something much more devastating: a spike in prescriptions for opioids, among other pain medications, as well as an increase in substance abuse generally.And that increase caused a drop in employment, according to Matthew Murray, a professor at the University of Tennessee who is studying the interaction of opioid use and the labor markets. \u201cOpioid use has a large impact on both unemployment rates as well as employment participation rates,\u201d both indicators of the health of a local economy.While there are no definitive numbers, Andy Wallace, the deputy mayor for the county, estimates that over 95 percent of those jailed committed offenses that were in some way related to drug use.Some finessed the drug testing the company did. \u201cPeople knew how to play the game,\u201d Mr. Simpson said. \u201cWe have a four-day workweek, so Thursday was party night\u201d since retesting didn\u2019t occur until the following week. Now the testing is done more frequently.They realized that a two-hour interview is insufficient and that, more important, many are unprepared to go from jail to work. Now, those accepted after extensive interviewing start a two-week life-skills course that includes classes on health, hygiene, cooking and renting, as well as car maintenance and computer skills. Religion isn\u2019t a prerequisite and bible classes are optional.There\u2019s a six-month training program to learn the skills for the job, like welding or painting, during which time participants are paid $10 an hour. (Once they graduate and are considered permanent employees, their salaries jump to $12 an hour, and they\u2019re eligible for another raise three months later. The state\u2019s minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, the federal rate.)With so many advances in manufacturing, including the automating of many tasks, Mr. Simpson considered buying a robotic welding tool that would ultimately save money and improve efficiencies. But, he said, \u201cwe made a choice not to automate\u201d to keep those jobs for the men in the program.Since its inception in September 2017, 23 men have participated in the program. Of those, 10 have already graduated and three are getting ready to work, Ms. Bosch said. Jason Cox, who originally had been jailed for vandalism, and then served additional time for failing to pay his fines, was one of the first hired. \u201cI had been out of jail for a month and a half. I was looking for work and getting a lot of nos.\u201d But he heard about the program from a family friend, passed a two-hour intake, and was hired.He was assigned to the shipping area. Within a few months, the woman running the department left for another job and Mr. Cox was promoted. He brings another skill that he had undervalued: an affinity for computers that emerged only after Mr. Bosch casually asked about hobbies. That skill has been put to use frequently, said Keith Simpson, who is Tony Simpson\u2019s first cousin and vice president of operations for BMT, as well as the president of a new division, Dyna Hauler.Shane Wyatt heard about the program from his cellmate, who had written to Ms. Bosch. He liked what she had to say. \u201cIf you\u2019re not 100 percent in, there\u2019s no sense in coming,\u201d he recalled. Mr. Wyatt liked the tough-love approach, which he said, also included compassion. He now works for the company, pressure-washing and painting trailers.Others with a history of substance abuse have been hired outside of the program. Becky Goney, for example, a welder, had gone through a so-called recovery court and then trained at the the Tennessee College of Applied Technology here to learn how to weld. The recovery court, training and employment, she said, have kept her clean and enabled her to be with her three children again.\u201cWe believe that much of addiction \u2014 to both drugs and alcohol \u2014 comes from a lot of chaos,\u2019\u2019 Judge Sexton said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to eliminate that by showing how to live on one\u2019s own, find housing and get employment. But until the Simpsons put together their program, we\u2019ve always had a hard time finding employment\u201d for those with a past.Spirituality can help those trying to overcome addiction, said Kenneth E. Leonard, the director of the Research Institute on Addictions at the University at Buffalo, but you \u201ccan\u2019t just pray these problems away\u201d Judge Sexton said. Both Professor Leonard and Judge Sexton said that steady work is critically important.\u201cWe\u2019ve known since the late 1960s that employment is a powerful predictor of low patterns of alcohol use and better responses to treatment. Similarly, some data suggests that when those addicted to opiates are stably employed and in a relationship with someone who doesn\u2019t use drugs, the outcomes are better,\u201d Professor Leonard said.He added that with opioids, 60 to 80 percent have relapsed to some extent within six months. But with regular drug testing, only one out of 23 of those hired have relapsed, Ms. Bosch said.Not everyone thought the program was a good idea at the beginning. Keith Simpson acknowledges that he was opposed initially. But he\u2019s now a fan of the program \u2014- so much so that he has co-signed a lease with one of the men in the program, since securing suitable housing is a problem for those with a felony past.To deal with that problem, they are building a 30-bed building for transitional housing. The one-acre site, across from the factory, has been graded and construction should begin soon, Mr. Simpson said.Campbell County has an active tourism business that accounts for $59 million a year in revenue, largely centered on boating on its lakes and off-roading in the surrounding mountains, according to Andy Wallace, the deputy mayor for the county. While that gives rise to jobs, the work is seasonal and often low-paying.The county also has a manufacturing economy. BSH Home Appliance Corp., has manufactured Thermador ranges and ovens at its plant in LaFollette for more than 20 years. Including a cooking technology center in Caryville, Tenn., the company employs more than 330 people, according to a spokesman, Joe Foster.Professor Murray said, they\u2019re \u201ctrying to create their own work force, which is very noble. It is, however, a risky and costly endeavor.\u201d So far, the risks have been manageable. The costs are significant: Tony Simpson says he has personally invested more than $500,000 to get the New Beginning program up and running.While Mr. Simpson has so far focused on men, he is planning a program to help women who have served time. Some, says Keith Simpson are skilled in the longstanding sewing traditions of Appalachia, and they hope to mobilize these women to work in the textile industry.The problem of substance abuse is widespread. But because of the glimmers of hope, Ms. Bosch suggested, somewhat offhandedly in a group call in August, that they have a municipal gathering to celebrate those in recovery.On Sept. 21, in LaFollette, the biggest town in the county, the crowd that had gathered for the free dinner, heard Christian-themed music and speeches acknowledging the challenges, as well as the success stories.Many shared their stories of addiction and rehabilitation. They lamented what many considered a \u201clost generation\u201d and a large number of grandparents raising their grandchildren because of parents lost to substance abuse.Those involved say it\u2019s a process.\u201cWe\u2019re not just training to work here, but we want to change Campbell County. We want to see more qualified people so we\u2019re attractive to people. We want them to know there\u2019s a skilled work force,\u201d Mr. Bosch said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside What Even an Ally Calls Trump\u2019s \u2018Reality Distortion Field\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFrom nonexistent riots to conspiracy theories about migrants to false claims about his popularity and job-creating record, the president has offered a litany of falsehoods in the midterm campaign. In the past couple of weeks alone, the president has spoken of riots that have not happened, claimed deals that have not been reached, cited jobs that have not been created and spun dark conspiracies that have no apparent basis in reality. He has pulled figures seemingly out of thin air, rewritten history and contradicted his own past comments.The catalog of inaccurate claims ranges from the weighty to the head-scratching. Mr. Trump\u2019s penchant for prevarication has been a well-documented hallmark of his presidency. He dismisses journalists who point out his falsehoods as nit-pickers who do not understand that he is speaking a larger truth that resonates with many Americans. Supporters at his rallies across the country tell reporters that they understand he may not be strictly accurate in his roaring stump speeches, but they see him as a champion of their values.Here are 15 of Mr. Trump\u2019s most egregious falsehoods since Oct. 22, fact-checked by category. what mr. trump said We\u2019re the only country in the world where a person comes in and has a baby, and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United States ... with all of those benefits. what mr. trump said There\u2019s a town in California where they actually tried to take over the town council. All illegal aliens running the town council.While there are a few examples of unauthorized immigrants participating in local government in California, there are no cities governed by them, nor do any hold elective office in the state. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any such place in California and am unaware of any place in California where you could even vote for city council as a noncitizen, not to speak of serving in elected office,\u201d said Taeku Lee, a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cSeems like another made-up fact intended to stoke the fears of the president\u2019s base.\u201d Els de Graauw, a professor of political science at the City University of New York, agreed. \u201cI know that requirements can vary across offices and levels of government, but I cannot think of a municipality where noncitizens can run for public office,\u201d she said.what mr. trump said what mr. trump saidDo you know how the caravan started? Does everybody know what this means? I think the Democrats had something to do with it.What Mr. Trump SaidWhat Mr. Trump SaidYou know, many presidents don\u2019t get a chance to put a Supreme Court justice on. Here we are, less than two years, we\u2019ve put two of them on. Right?What Mr. Trump SaidAnd I was always critical of President Bush for attacking Iraq.What Mr. Trump SaidI went to Saudi Arabia on the basis that they would buy hundreds of billions \u2014 many billions of dollars\u2019 worth of things. And the ultimate number is around $450 billion, $110 for military. $450 billion. I think that\u2019s over a million jobs. A million to over a million jobs.Mr. Trump has celebrated an arms deal that was reached with Saudi Arabia last year, but his figures are wildly inflated.Last year, the Trump administration also trumpeted $270 billion in possible commercial deals, which double-counts some of the agreements in the arms package. It is unclear what Mr. Trump is referring to with the $450 billion figure.What Mr. Trump SaidBut I\u2019m one of the most popular presidents in this country, and that\u2019s good. That\u2019s just good.what mr. trump saidThe total amount of opioids being prescribed has decreased by nearly 20 percent in a very short period of time. I\u2019m very proud of that.what mr. trump saidRepublicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not! Vote Republican.What Mr. Trump Said\u201cAmerica: the Cleanest Air in the World \u2014 BY FAR!\u201dwhat mr. trump saidWe don\u2019t even have tariffs. I\u2019m using tariffs to negotiate. I mean, other than some tariffs on steel \u2014 which is actually small, what do we have?what mr. trump saidThey wouldn\u2019t meet with Obama, the European Union. Japan wouldn\u2019t meet with Obama. And they wouldn\u2019t meet with us either.what mr. trump saidI remember Dick Grasso, a friend of mine, great guy.

{"Headline": "These Are the World\u2019s Best Candies. Want to Fight About It?", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export.

Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s.

White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit.

Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTrade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times. She has won two James Beard Foundation awards for restaurant criticism.For millions of Latin Americans, the Colombina factory in La Paila is the place where sweet moments are made.Leer en enspa\u00f1olFor nearly 50 years, Bon Bon Bums have been produced in the Colombina factory in La Paila, north of Cali. At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Sri Lanka Faces Constitutional Crisis as President Unseats Prime Minister", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Sri Lanka plunged into a constitutional crisis Friday after the president ousted the prime minister, a move that took the nation by surprise and was denounced as illegal by some government ministers.Sri Lankans were glued to their television sets Friday after President Maithripala Sirisena dismissed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and replaced him with Mahinda Rajapaksa, a popular former leader who was accused of human rights abuses, brazen nepotism and excessively close ties to China when he governed the country.The swearing-in ceremony, broadcast live, was a moment of high political drama for Sri Lanka, with Mr. Rajapaksa grinning as he shook Mr. Sirisena\u2019s hand. The men were former political allies until the president broke away from Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s party to unseat him in 2015.Fireworks and celebrations broke out across Sri Lanka after the swearing in ceremony, but the capital, Colombo, was uneasy as some cabinet ministers declared the move unconstitutional. Mr. Rajapaksa was sworn in at about 7 p.m. as representatives of the navy, air force and army watched in a stately room inside the presidential secretariat.Cabinet ministers and parliamentarians began defecting to the new government, but it remained unclear how many would ultimately cross over. The country\u2019s courts, seen as weak and politically influenced, were unlikely to rule against Mr. Sirisena.\u201cI am addressing you as the prime minister of Sri Lanka. I still hold the majority of the house,\u201d Mr. Wickremesinghe said in an address to the nation. \u201cConvene parliament and I will prove it.\u201dChaos gripped parts of the capital as supporters of Mr. Rajapaksa stormed the state-owned national television broadcaster and took it off the air. A clip later circulated showing a mob shouting at journalists inside the station. Troops were called in to protect the channel\u2019s staff.Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera tweeted that Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s appointment was \u201cunconstitutional and illegal. This is an anti-democratic coup.\u201dThe shake-up appeared to secure the re-ascendance of Mr. Rajapaksa, a man who served as Sri Lanka\u2019s president and prime minister for 10 years and ended the country\u2019s decades-long civil war.Mr. Rajapaksa is expected to win presidential elections next year, partly because Sri Lankans have grown discontent as the economy has sputtered under the current government.At the height of his power, Mr. Rajapaksa simultaneously served as president and finance minister, among other cabinet positions, while his three brothers served as the defense secretary and ministers of economy and ports. Between them they controlled 80 percent of the national budget and were accused of corruption and major human rights abuses. Their opponents and journalists critical of their governance often disappeared.Mr. Sirisena\u2019s power play is as much about the clashing personalities of the president and the prime minister as it is about geopolitics. The president and just-ousted prime minister had been political foes until they decided to unite their parties to run against Mr. Rajapaksa in 2015.India and China have been vying for influence in Sri Lanka, the island nation off India\u2019s southern coast. The country\u2019s ties with China strengthened under Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s rule, when he borrowed billions of dollars from Beijing\u2019s government to build infrastructure projects, some with little economic purpose.Western officials worry China could eventually use the strategically located port \u2014 which sits at the crossroads of one of the world\u2019s busiest maritime routes \u2014 for military purposes, which Beijing and Colombo have denied.Tension between President Sirisena and his ousted prime minister, Mr. Wickremesinghe, had been building up over the past year and spilled out into the open over the last few weeks. Mr. Sirisena began firing the heads of state institutions not in his purview and stacking them with loyalists.Last week, Mr. Wickremesinghe flew to India to meet with his counterpart, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, hoping to smooth relations. Mr. Wickremesinghe then released a summary of the meeting, claiming Mr. Modi had complained that Sri Lanka\u2019s government was stalling its infrastructure investments in the country and was not responding positively to India\u2019s diplomatic overtures.India\u2019s government was relieved when Mr. Rajapaksa lost elections in 2015, complaining that the former leader had strained ties with New Delhi while moving the country closer to Beijing.After the elections, India said it would invest in infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka and earlier this year committed to buy an airport in the country\u2019s south next to the Chinese-built seaport. But the airport deal has stalled.American officials were likely to be unhappy with the government shake up, believing Mr. Rajapaksa is too close to China to keep the country neutral.Vice President Mike Pence blasted what he called China\u2019s \u201cdebt trap diplomacy\u201d earlier this month and singled out Sri Lanka, saying the Chinese-built seaport \u201cmay soon become a forward military base for China\u2019s growing blue-water navy.\u201dAn earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s swearing-in; it was attended by representatives of the army, navy and air force, not by their chiefs. It also referred incorrectly to Sri Lanka\u2019s civil war; it ended in 2009, not 2015.Maria Abi-Habib reported from Islamabad and Dharisha Bastians from Colombo, Sri Lanka.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Iran Widens an Already Huge Rift Between Europe and U.S.", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Of all the issues dividing Europe and the Trump administration, Iran has become the sharpest, with the Europeans actively working against United States policy, placing them in league with Russia, China and Iran.As they do so, they are pressing Iran to adhere strictly to the terms of the nuclear agreement, to avoid giving the United States and Israel a pretext for starting a war \u2014 an increasing concern.And they are counseling Tehran to keep calm and wait out President Trump\u2019s term, in the hope that he will not be re-elected, senior European diplomats say.That, of course, could be wishful thinking, but the divergent policies toward Iran are leading to deeper tensions between the European Union and the Trump administration.Last month, the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, mocked the European Union for being \u201cstrong on rhetoric and weak on follow-through,\u201d adding: \u201cWe do not intend to allow our sanctions to be evaded by Europe or anyone else.\u201d\u201cEurope and the U.S. are not simply taking different approaches to Iran, but are actively working against one another in a policy field which is of significant strategic interest to both sides,\u201d he said.The dispute over the Iran deal, he continued, \u201cis a major driver of European debates about a form of \u2018strategic autonomy\u2019 \u201d from the United States and represents a more serious cleavage in the Western alliance than did the invasion of Iraq in 2003.The mechanism could use a form of barter, offsetting values of imports and exports priced in euros while avoiding banking transactions. The main objective is to allow Iran to keep selling its oil, on which much of its economy depends \u2014 exactly the reason Washington is trying to restrict that commerce.But it remains unclear if the European efforts will succeed. Big multinational firms like Total, Peugeot, Renault, Eni, Siemens and Daimler are already pulling out of Iran, saying they cannot risk being shut out of the American financial system.Iran\u2019s oil exports have declined significantly since August, putting pressure on supporters of the nuclear deal in Tehran and strengthening more hard-line elements that want to break the deal and start enriching uranium again, in greater quality as well as quantity.\u201cThe primary objective of the European Union is to provide a face-saving way for Iran to stay in the\u201d nuclear deal, said Ellie Geranmayeh of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe Europeans are trying with Russia and China to create an economic package for Iran, but also some political steps to keep Iran in the deal, especially after Nov. 4.\u201dThe Europeans are also trying to help small and medium enterprises with little exposure in the United States to continue trading with Iran.The question is how far the Trump administration will go to enforce sanctions, and whether it will allow waivers, as it has in the past, for work with Iran\u2019s civilian nuclear program, Ms. Geranmayeh said.\u201cBut if the deal collapses altogether, you can bet Iran will expand its nuclear program,\u201d she said, \u201cand that would put everyone back in the pre-2013 condition, and Europe especially does not want to be there.\u201dGiven the existing tensions between Iran and Sunni Arab states like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, not to speak of those with Israel, a war is not inconceivable.A conflict over Syria, especially with Iranian and Iranian-backed forces near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, could create a pretext for Israel to bomb Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, as it wanted to do before the nuclear deal was signed. And while Mr. Obama restrained Israel, Mr. Trump might not.The Europeans are telling Tehran that the nuclear pact is not just an economic deal, \u201cbut has important political and security dimensions for Iran, and so far Iran is listening,\u201d Ms. Geranmayeh said. Europe is emphasizing its efforts at de-escalating tensions, and has already had three meetings as part of a new security dialogue with Iran.Washington has said that the nuclear deal was faulty, in part because it did not restrain Iranian actions in the region, like its support for states and groups the Americans consider troublemakers: the Syrian government; Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shiite group; and Hamas, the militant group in Gaza.But European governments say the Americans have done little to roll back Iranian influence. It is the Europeans who are trying to create a platform for dialogue with Iran and other regional actors, and who are pushing Iran to discuss its activities in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.There is one other important difference, Ms. Geranmayeh said. While Washington now \u201csees no shades of gray in the Iranian leadership,\u201d she added, \u201cthe European Union countries, on the ground in Iran, see competitive factions inside the regime.\u201dThe Europeans are trying to support those in Iran, like Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and President Hassan Rouhani, whom they regard as more moderate, and whose political standing has been weakened by Mr. Trump\u2019s actions.He accused both Mr. Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of \u201ccherry-picking intelligence and inflating threats,\u201d adding: \u201cThey\u2019re making specious connections between Iran and terrorists, including Al Qaeda and the Islamic State. And they\u2019re ratcheting up their rhetoric.\u201dThese tensions are about to get worse, Mr. Cirincione said, with the imposition of the stiff new sanctions. The likelihood that this pressure will explode into military conflict is rising dramatically,\u201d he said.His dark view is precisely what European officials fear, and precisely why they are trying to persuade Iran to adhere to the nuclear deal, to modify its behavior in the region, and to wait out the Trump presidency.Advertisement"}

For that reason, they say, there can be no substantial concessions to the North in the talks over its nuclear weapons until it takes real steps toward disarming.\u201cThere is a bottom-line difference between President Moon and the skeptics,\u201d said Koh Yu-hwan, a professor of North Korean studies at Dongguk University in Seoul. \u201cHe believes that Kim Jong-un was sincere when he told him that he was willing to denuclearize. The skeptics don\u2019t.\u201d\u201dChairman Kim told me that besides the moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and missiles, he would dismantle the facilities that produce them, as well as all the nuclear weapons and fissile materials his country owns, if the United States takes corresponding measures,\u201d Mr. Moon said this month.Even leaving aside the question of his true intentions, Mr. Kim is a difficult figure to vouch for.Mr. Moon\u2019s critics say he is playing into the North Korean leader\u2019s hands. Mr. Kim\u2019s ultimate goal, they say, is to get the world accustomed to the reality of a nuclear-armed North, while using negotiations to stall for time and create a false sense of progress.\u201cWe had tried this in past negotiations: offering North Korea a comprehensive package of incentives in the hopes that it would denuclearize,\u201d said Yun Duk-min, a former chancellor of the Korea National Diplomatic Academy who now teaches at the Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work. I don\u2019t think it will this time, either.\u201dBut another South Korean analyst, Lee Seong-hyon, shared Mr. Moon\u2019s vision, saying \u201ca great transformation\u201d was unfolding on the Korean Peninsula.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to make the same old argument about why North Korea can\u2019t be trusted,\u201d said Mr. Lee, of the Sejong Institute near Seoul. \u201cBut rather than being fixated on the old way of looking at North Korea, we should ask ourselves whether we can recognize Kim Jong-un as a new type of leader and find a solution there.\u201dEven if Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim haven\u2019t convinced every analyst, they have made a far bigger score with Mr. Trump, whose attitude toward Mr. Kim and the North has changed drastically.But that transition is \u201ca very difficult challenge for a North Korean leader,\u201d Mr. Pompeo said, because the country has depended for decades on the nuclear program as the linchpin for its security. \u201cTo execute on that is complex and will take time,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Rent Control Is a Lightning Rod ", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byProposition 10 in California has put a new focus on an old question: whether rent control tends to ease or compound a shortage of affordable housing. And yet economists from both the right and the left are in almost universal agreement that rent control makes housing problems worse in the long run. Here\u2019s what\u2019s behind their thinking and the nuances of the debate. Proposition 10 would repeal a state law that prevents local laws, but it wouldn\u2019t make new law itself. If it passes, cities could enact more stringent and expansive rent control laws, and some are already looking into it. But they don\u2019t have to, and many won\u2019t.Tenants\u2019 rights organizations argue that California\u2019s affordability crisis demands more rent-controlled units, as well as tools like vacancy control. They say the disparity between rent-controlled units and market rate prices encourages landlords to evict poorer residents in favor of people who can pay more. Vacancy control could prevent this by regulating the rent regardless of who lives there: Why would landlords push tenants out if they couldn\u2019t raise the rent for the next person? On the other hand, most studies show that even though rent control is great for tenants who get it, the policies can lead to higher rents and fewer units over all. Of course, this won\u2019t do much for renters who are struggling now. To that end, a number of economists have suggested subsidies or tax credits as an alternative to rent control, because they can shield renters from big price increases while being tailored to people who need the most help. Mr. Palmer\u2019s studies have suggested that rent control distorts the housing market. But like many other economists, he is not opposed to greater government efforts to help renters. The debate is about how to do it. Advertisement"}

Mr. Hajaji had already lost one son three weeks earlier to the epidemic of hunger sweeping across Yemen. Now he feared that a second was slipping away.It wasn\u2019t for a lack of food in the area: The stores outside the hospital gate were filled with goods and the markets were bustling. But Mr. Hajaji couldn\u2019t afford any of it because prices were rising too fast.\u201cI can barely buy a piece of stale bread,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why my children are dying before my eyes.\u201dBut aid experts and United Nations officials say a more insidious form of warfare is also being waged in Yemen, an economic war that is exacting a far greater toll on civilians and now risks tipping the country into a famine of catastrophic proportions.OmanSaudi ArabiaSparselypopulatedareasHADRAMAWTRegionAl GhaydahAslamYemenHajjahSanaJuberiaMaribZabidRidaAl MukallaDenselypopulatedareasTaizWhere the Hunger Crisis Is Worstmore severe100 milesAdenWhere the Hunger Crisis Is Worstmore severeSaudi ArabiaSparselypopulatedareasHajjahAl GhaydahYemenSanaAl MukallaRidaTaizAden100 milesOmanSaudi ArabiaSparselypopulatedareasHADRAMAWTRegionAl GhaydahYemenHajjahMaribSanaAl MukallaZabidRidaTaizWhere the Hunger Crisis Is WorstAdenmore severe100 milesOmanSparselypopulatedareasSaudi ArabiaHADRAMAWTRegionAl GhaydahAslamHajjahYemenSanaJuberiaMaribZabidRidaAl MukallaDenselypopulatedareasTaizWhere the Hunger Crisis Is Worstmore severe100 milesAdenBy Jugal K. Patel and Troy GriggsNote: Hunger severity data projected for next three months | Source:  Famine Early Warning Systems NetworkUnder the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi-led coalition and its Yemeni allies have imposed a raft of punitive economic measures aimed at undercutting the Houthi rebels who control northern Yemen. But these actions \u2014 including periodic blockades, stringent import restrictions and withholding the salaries of about a million civil servants \u2014 have landed on the backs of civilians, laying the economy to waste and driving millions deeper into poverty.Those measures have inflicted a slow-burn toll: infrastructure destroyed, jobs lost, a weakening currency and soaring prices. But in recent weeks the economic collapse has gathered pace at alarming speed, causing top United Nations officials to revise their predictions of famine.\u201cThere is now a clear and present danger of an imminent and great, big famine engulfing Yemen,\u201d Mark Lowcock, the under secretary for humanitarian affairs, told the Security Council on Tuesday. Eight million Yemenis already depend on emergency food aid to survive, he said, a figure that could soon rise to 14 million, or half Yemen\u2019s population.\u201cPeople think famine is just a lack of food,\u201d said Alex de Waal, author of \u201cMass Starvation\u201d which analyzes recent man-made famines. \u201cBut in Yemen it\u2019s about a war on the economy.\u201dThe signs are everywhere, cutting across boundaries of class, tribe and region. Unpaid university professors issue desperate appeals for help on social media. Doctors and teachers are forced to sell their gold, land or cars to feed their families. On the streets of the capital, Sana, an elderly woman begs for alms with a loudspeaker.\u201cHelp me,\u201d the woman, Zahra Bajali, calls out. \u201cI have a sick husband. I have a house for rent. Help.\u201dAnd in the hushed hunger wards, ailing infants hover between life and death. Of nearly two million malnourished children in Yemen, 400,000 are considered critically ill \u2014 a figure projected to rise by one quarter in the coming months.\u201cWe are being crushed,\u201d said Dr. Mekkia Mahdi at the health clinic in Aslam, an impoverished northwestern town that has been swamped with refugees fleeing the fighting in Hudaydah, an embattled port city 90 miles to the south.Flitting between the beds at her spartan clinic, she cajoled mothers, dispensed orders to medics and spoon-fed milk to sickly infants. For some it was too late: the night before, an 11-month old boy had died. He weighed five and a half pounds.Looking around her, Dr. Mahdi could not fathom the Western obsession with the Saudi killing of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul.\u201cWe\u2019re surprised the Khashoggi case is getting so much attention while millions of Yemeni children are suffering,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody gives a damn about them.\u201dShe tugged on the flaccid skin of a drowsy 7-year-old girl with stick-like arms. \u201cLook,\u201d she said. \u201cNo meat. Only bones.\u201dThe embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington did not respond to questions about the country\u2019s policies in Yemen. But Saudi officials have defended their actions, citing rockets fired across their border by the Houthis, an armed group professing Zaidi Islam, an offshoot of Shiism, that Saudi Arabia, a Sunni monarchy, views as a proxy for its regional rival, Iran.The Saudis point out that they, along with the United Arab Emirates, are among the most generous donors to Yemen\u2019s humanitarian relief effort. Last spring, the two allies pledged $1 billion in aid to Yemen. In January, Saudi Arabia deposited $2 billion in Yemen\u2019s central bank to prop up its currency.But those efforts have been overshadowed by the coalition\u2019s attacks on Yemen\u2019s economy, including the denial of salaries to civil servants, a partial blockade that has driven up food prices, and the printing of vast amounts of bank notes, which caused the currency to plunge.And the offensive to capture Hudaydah, which started in June, has endangered the main lifeline for imports to northern Yemen, displaced 570,000 people and edged many more closer to starvation.A famine here, Mr. Lowcock warned, would be \u201cmuch bigger than anything any professional in this field has seen during their working lives.\u201d\u201cPeople said burn him in the body and it will be O.K.,\u201d Mr. Hajaji said. \u201cWhen you have no money, and your son is sick, you\u2019ll believe anything.\u201dThe burns were a mark of the rudimentary nature of life in Juberia, a cluster of mud-walled houses perched on a rocky ridge. To reach it, you cross a landscape of sandy pastures, camels and beehives, strewn with giant, rust-colored boulders, where women in black cloaks and yellow straw boaters toil in the fields.In the past, the men of the village worked as migrant laborers in Saudi Arabia, whose border is 80 miles away. They were often treated with disdain by their wealthy Saudi employers but they earned a wage. Mr. Hajaji worked on a suburban construction site in Mecca, the holy city visited by millions of Muslim pilgrims every year.When the war broke out in 2015, the border closed.The fighting never reached Juberia, but it still took a toll there.Last year a young woman died of cholera, part of an epidemic that infected 1.1 million Yemenis. In April, a coalition airstrike hit a wedding party in the district, killing 33 people, including the bride. A local boy who went to fight for the Houthis was killed in an airstrike.But for Mr. Hajaji, who had five sons under age 7, the deadliest blow was economic.He watched in dismay as the riyal lost half its value in the past year, causing prices to soar. Suddenly, groceries cost twice as much as they had before the war. Other villagers sold their assets, such as camels or land, to get money for food.But Mr. Hajaji, whose family lived in a one-room, mud-walled hut, had nothing to sell.At first he relied on the generosity of neighbors. Then he pared back the family diet, until it consisted only of bread, tea and halas, a vine leaf that had always been a source of food but now occupied a central place in every meal.Soon his first son to fall ill, Shaadi, was vomiting and had diarrhea, classic symptoms of malnutrition. Mr. Hajaji wanted to take the ailing 4-year-old to the hospital, but that was out of the question: fuel prices had risen by 50 percent over the previous year.One morning in late September, Mr. Hajaji walked into his house to find Shaadi silent and immobile, with a yellow tinge to his skin. \u201cI knew he was gone,\u201d he said. He kissed his son on the forehead, bundled him up in his arms, and walked along a winding hill path to the village mosque.That evening, after prayers, the village gathered to bury Shaadi. His grave, marked by a single broken rock, stood under a grove of Sidr trees that, in better times, were famous for their honey.Shaadi was the first in the village to die from hunger.A few weeks later, when Shaher took ill, Mr. Hajaji was determined to do something. When burning didn\u2019t work, he carried his son down the stony path to a health clinic, which was ill-equipped for the task. Half of Yemen\u2019s health facilities are closed because of the war.So his family borrowed $16 for the journey to the hospital in Hajjah.\u201cAll the big countries say they are fighting each other in Yemen,\u201d Mr. Hajaji said. \u201cBut it feels to us like they are fighting the poor people.\u201dIn 2016, the Saudi-backed Yemeni government transferred the operations of the central bank from the Houthi-controlled capital, Sana, to the southern city of Aden. The bank, whose policies are dictated by Saudi Arabia, a senior Western official said, started printing vast amounts of new money \u2014 at least 600 billion riyals, according to one bank official. The new money caused an inflationary spiral that eroded the value of any savings people had.The bank also stopped paying salaries to civil servants in Houthi-controlled areas, where 80 percent of Yemenis live. With the government as the largest employer, hundreds of thousands of families in the north suddenly had no income.At the Sabeen hospital in Sana, Dr. Huda Rajumi treats the country\u2019s most severely malnourished children. But her own family is suffering, too, as she falls out of Yemen\u2019s vanishing middle class.In the past year, she has received only a single month\u2019s salary. Her husband, a retired soldier, is no longer getting his pension, and Dr. Rajumi has started to skimp on everyday pleasures, like fruit, meat and taxi rides, to make ends meet.\u201cWe get by because people help each other out,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s getting hard.\u201dSaudi Arabia\u2019s tight control over all air and sea movements into northern Yemen has effectively made the area a prison for those who live there. In September, the World Health Organization brokered the establishment of a humanitarian air bridge to allow the sickest Yemenis \u2014 cancer patients and others with life-threatening conditions \u2014 to fly to Egypt.Among those on the waiting list is Maimoona Naji, a 16-year-old girl with a melon-size tumor on her left leg. At a hostel in Sana, her father, Ali Naji, said they had obtained visas and money to travel to India for emergency treatment. Their hopes soared in September when his daughter was told she would be on the first plane out of Sana once the airlift started.But the agreement has stalled, blocked by the Yemeni government, according to the senior Western official. Maimoona and dozens of other patients have been left stranded, the clock ticking on their illnesses.\u201cFirst they told us \u2018next week, next week,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Naji, shuffling through reams of documents as tears welled up in his eyes. \u201cThen they said no. Where is the humanity in that? What did we do to deserve this?\u201dIn Houthi-held areas, aid workers say, commanders level illegal taxes at checkpoints and frequently try to divert international relief aid to the families of soldiers, or to line their own pockets.At the United Nations on Tuesday, Mr. Lowcock, the humanitarian official, said that aid workers in Yemen faced obstacles including delayed visas, retracted work permits and interference in the work \u2014 problems, officials said privately, that were greatest in Houthi-held areas.Despite the harrowing scenes of suffering in the north, some Yemenis are getting rich. Upmarket parts of Sana are enjoying a mini real estate boom, partly fueled by Yemeni migrants returned from Saudi Arabia, but also by newly enriched Houthi officials.Local residents say they have seen Houthi officials from modest backgrounds driving around the city in Lexus four-wheel drives, or shopping in luxury stores, trailed by armed gunmen, to buy suits and perfumes.Tensions reached a climax this summer when the head of the United Nations migration agency was forced to leave Sana after clashing with the Houthi administration.In an interview, the Houthi vice foreign minister, Hussain al-Ezzi, denied reports of corruption, and insisted that tensions with the United Nations had been resolved.\u201cWe don\u2019t deny there have been some mistakes on our side,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working to improve them.\u201dTo stave it off, aid workers are not appealing for shipments of relief aid but for urgent measures to rescue the battered economy.\u201cThis is an income famine,\u201d said Lise Grande, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Yemen. \u201cThe key to stopping it is to ensure that people have enough money to buy what they need to survive.\u201dThe priority should be to stabilize the falling currency, she said, and to ensure that traders and shipping companies can import the food that Yemenis need.Above all, she added, \u201cthe fighting has to stop.\u201dOne hope for Yemenis is that the international fallout from the death of the Saudi dissident, Jamal Khashoggi, which has damaged Prince Mohammed\u2019s international standing, might force him to relent in his unyielding prosecution of the war.Peter Salisbury, a Yemen specialist at Chatham House, said that was unlikely.\u201cI think the Saudis have learned what they can get away with in Yemen \u2014 that western tolerance for pretty bad behavior is quite high,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the Khashoggi murder tells us anything, it\u2019s just how reluctant people are to rein the Saudis in.\u201dProduced by Craig Allen, Herbert Buchsbaum, David Furst, Josh Keller, Meghan Petersen and Andrew Rossback.

{"Headline": "Far From the Shattered Coast, Hurricane Michael Packed an Unexpected Punch", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMARIANNA, Fla. \u2014 After carving a path of despair along the coast of Florida\u2019s Panhandle, Hurricane Michael drubbed the state\u2019s inland rural communities with such unexpected brutal force that it left residents and officials stunned \u2014 and facing a daunting recovery.That a ferocious storm could blast north from the Gulf of Mexico and through a battery of states before it finally fled to the Atlantic Ocean early on Friday was always a possibility, but not one people here thought likely.\u201cThere\u2019s a group of us who have been warning about this for years,\u201d said Rodney E. Andreasen, director of emergency management for Jackson County, where Marianna is the county seat. Mr. Andreasen said the area felt sustained winds of 130 to 140 miles per hour.By the time Michael crossed into Georgia, it was still classified as a major Category 3 hurricane with a clearly defined and devastating eye.\u201cWe\u2019re only 40 miles from the coast as the crow flies, and hurricanes don\u2019t respect coastlines,\u201d Mr. Andreasen said.Hurricanes are fickle beasts, their projected paths never certain, their total destruction sometimes not known for days. The death toll rose to 18 on Saturday, with people killed by trees or washed away in cars in Florida, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia.Officials in Virginia confirmed on Saturday six deaths in the state, including two family members who were swept from a bridge.Still, Mr. Andreasen could not have foreseen the magnitude of devastation in his county in Florida: Much of the road department was a pile of rubble. The sheriff\u2019s office lost its roof. Even the generator at the emergency operations complex failed Thursday night, before another one was brought in.\u201cThis is the worst disaster Jackson County has ever seen,\u201d Mr. Andreasen said. Three deaths were recorded in that county. A fourth remains under investigation, and the sheriff said his deputies continued to find people trapped inside their homes by felled trees.The first sign of help Darryl Brunson and his brothers said they saw was on Friday, when marked police cars raced down their street, their intent unclear, and maneuvered across an obstacle course of trees. A few minutes later, heavy equipment yanked one of the huge tree trunks from the ground and hauled it away.\u201cEverything else we cleaned ourselves with our bare hands,\u201d said Mr. Brunson, 27.The hurricane\u2019s winds were so strong, Mr. Brunson said, that he did not hear a tree snap and fall in his own front yard \u2014 away from the house, luckily, and from his four children, who range in age from 1 to 6 years old.\u201cWe didn\u2019t figure it was going to be this bad,\u201d he said, the storm\u2019s remnants scattered around him: A gate that belonged in the back yard was in the front yard, as was what was left of a playhouse. A trampoline he thought he had secured tore a hole in his roof.We analyzed aerial images of Mexico Beach, Fla., and found that at least three-quarters of the buildings along a one-mile stretch were destroyed or severely damaged.Now Mr. Brunson, who works at a nearby Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, and his neighbors fear weeks without electricity \u2014 and perhaps without paychecks \u2014 as the town of Marianna and the rest of Florida\u2019s vast rural counties struggle to return from a disaster usually associated with beachfronts. Some of them worry the shattered coast, beloved by residents and tourists alike, will draw most of the attention and dollars, leaving places like this one, with shoestring economies to begin with, unattended.\u201cWe\u2019re one of the largest dirt-road counties in the entire state of Florida,\u201d said Eric Hall, a county commissioner, of the challenges of getting around after the storm.On Lafayette Street in downtown Marianna, a corner law firm\u2019s entire facade was blown out, exposing two floors of desks and filing cabinets inside. A well-liked restaurant looked like a box missing the front and top.In nearby Gadsden County, where officials said at least two tornadoes touched down on Wednesday, Steve Sweet died in his wife\u2019s arms after a tree fell on their home, his wife told reporters on Thursday. Gayle Sweet said she waited outside and refused to go to a hospital for treatment herself until his body had been taken away.On Friday, she said in a phone interview that she was still too heartbroken to talk about her loss. \u201cIt\u2019s been a nightmare,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cHe was so wonderful.\u201dIn Quincy, a line dozens of cars deep stretched into the road Friday morning from a parking lot in a prison next to a National Guard armory, where service members offered families cases of water, boxes of ready-to-eat meals and roof tarps. Shortly after the trucks pulled in, word had spread around town \u2014 in spite of the lack of power and cellphone service \u2014 that some help had arrived.\u201cThere\u2019s no shower. We can\u2019t use the toilet,\u201d said Halina Ciucci, whose home relies on well water powered by an electric pump. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping we can find an open A.T.M. to get cash because no one is taking credit cards.\u201dHurricane Michael had ripped apart a couple\u2019s home in Lynn Haven, Fla. Nearby residents braved the storm to rescue them.Ms. Ciucci, who moved years ago from Fort Lauderdale after losing everything in Hurricane Wilma in 2005, experienced the storm inside a mobile home. \u201cIt was horrible,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m from down south and this is the worst I\u2019ve ever been in.\u201dShakeria Dillard and Davaughn Wilson arrived in a van and asked for tarps for their damaged roof and anything they could get for their four children. They said they feared their power would not return for weeks.\u201cWe\u2019re going to have to stay,\u201d Ms. Dillard said. \u201cMoney is limited.\u201dThey left without what they hoped for most: ice.The damage extended deep inside Apalachicola National Forest, where, in the outpost of Sumatra, about 25 miles from the coast, Ashley Raffield and his wife, Brandy, said they went out late Wednesday as the last of Michael\u2019s winds passed to clear a path outside the home of Ms. Raffield\u2019s sister, who is nine months pregnant.\u201cWe\u2019re just trying to find the Red Cross,\u201d Mr. Raffield, 32, said late Thursday in Eastpoint, the nearest town on Apalachicola Bay, where the couple had found a small market open to buy baby food for their infant daughter. \u201cTo see if we could take showers or something.\u201dMr. Raffield said his grandparents used to evacuate from Apalachicola on the coast to Sumatra during hurricanes \u2014 so the family never expected Michael to inflict so much harm.\u201cIt got crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s worse up there than it is down here.\u201dChristina Caron and Julia Jacobs contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

The changes in the timeline below reflect that sampling error, not real changes in the race.One reason we\u2019re doing these surveys live is so you can see the uncertainty for yourself. There\u2019s a big question on top of the standard margin of error in a poll: Who is going to vote? It\u2019s a particularly challenging question this year, since special elections have shown Democrats voting in large numbers.To estimate the likely electorate, we combine what people say about how likely they are to vote with information about how often they have voted in the past. In previous races, this approach has been more accurate than simply taking people at their word. But there are many other ways to do it.All estimates based on 501 interviewsEven if we got turnout exactly right, the margin of error wouldn\u2019t capture all of the error in a poll. The simplest version assumes we have a perfect random sample of the voting population. We do not.People who respond to surveys are almost always too old, too white, too educated and too politically engaged to accurately represent everyone.Based on administrative records. Some characteristics are missing or incorrect. Many voters are called multiple times.Pollsters compensate by giving more weight to respondents from under-represented groups. But weighting works only if you weight by the right categories and you know what the composition of the electorate will be.

They don\u2019t represent the full range of possible weighting scenarios, let alone the full range of possible election results.About 13 percent of voters said that they were undecided or refused to tell us whom they would vote for. But if they were to break 2 to 1 in favor of Democrats, that alone would be enough to change the lead in our poll, assuming we did everything else perfectly.

TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 After enduring two decades of Republican statewide rule, Florida Democrats are pursuing a novel strategy to reclaim the Governor\u2019s Mansion \u2014 one that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. They are rallying behind a young, unapologetically liberal African-American candidate in a swing state where older conservative white voters have dominated five straight midterms.Andrew Gillum, the 39-year-old charismatic mayor of the capital city, Tallahassee, has energized Democrats desperate to end their losing streak. If Mr. Gillum builds a broad-enough coalition across Florida\u2019s disparate regions, he\u2019ll become not just the first black governor in state history but also arguably the most liberal governor in the nation.After years of choosing candidates like the former Republican governor, Charlie Crist (who lost his race for the governorship four years ago), Democrats now realize the futility of centrist politics in these hyperpartisan times. But a base-centered strategy on the left is untested in Florida and polls show a very tight race.Republicans, deeply fearful of Mr. Gillum, are doing their best to label him a radical socialist who will raise taxes and can\u2019t be trusted. A long-running F.B.I. investigation into deal-making at City Hall has so far yielded little dirt on Mr. Gillum outside of questions over how he obtained Hamilton tickets, and the inquiry has received sparse national coverage. But it hovers over him here like a storm cloud, partially because his former campaign treasurer was among those named in subpoenas.Beyond the headlines, Mr. DeSantis, a loner by nature, has appeared more at ease on his iPhone than in front of a crowd. He has struggled to connect with voters largely because until September, all he needed to win the GOP base was Trump\u2019s cheerleading and a steady stream of appearances on Fox News \u2014 and that\u2019s about all he had.His bland, stay-the-course message mostly praises the work of Gov. Rick Scott, who can\u2019t run again because of term limits and is challenging Senator Bill Nelson, a vulnerable Democrat. That strategy may not be enough to overcome Mr. Gillum\u2019s grass-roots power, according to Mac Stipanovich, a veteran Florida Republican strategist.\u201cGillum is the great disrupter,\u201d Mr. Stipanovich said. \u201cHe is the Donald Trump in this election. DeSantis represents more of the same. That\u2019s not an exciting message when people are excited.\u201dAt a recent party dinner in West Palm Beach, Mr. Gillum, the main attraction, took some time to address a packed, cheering audience. \u201cThere are more of us than there are of them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe power of the people is greater than the people in power. And we must not sound like and act like we are Republican Lite, y\u2019all. We have a belief system.\u201dInstead, Mr. Gillum\u2019s fate will depend on how well his aspirational vision plays in the nation\u2019s largest, most mercurial battleground \u2014 a place of such cultural and economic diversity that it\u2019s truly more like five states in one.The Gold Coast, a megalopolis of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties, is home to about a third of the state\u2019s 4.9 million Democratic voters. Known for its large bloc of progressive and immigrant voters, the area also houses so many Northeastern transplants that Michael Bloomberg refers to Palm Beach County as New York City\u2019s \u201csixth borough.\u201dSouth Florida Democrats, notorious for sitting out midterm elections, are expected to turn out in greater numbers thanks to increased organization efforts. After two days of early voting, more than 34,000 people have voted in deep-blue Broward County. In the last midterm, the two-day turnout was less than 14,000. So the early signs here are good for Mr. Gillum, but to win he\u2019ll still need support among the older centrist Democrats critical to Senator Nelson\u2019s statewide victories, which isn\u2019t a guarantee.Across the state\u2019s midsection is the swing-voter-heavy \u201cI-4 corridor,\u201d a land of suburban sprawl, citrus groves and farms, as well as the Tampa, Orlando and Daytona Beach metro areas. Home to Disney World and Nascar\u2019s Daytona 500, low-wage jobs supporting tourism and agribusiness predominate. If Mr. Gillum performs well there, he\u2019ll probably have avoided unnerving too many white middle-class suburbanites while winning over workers with his messaging on higher base pay.Mr. Gillum won\u2019t win North Florida. But by using the Barack Obama playbook here, he can win the ballots of many women, college students, union members and African-Americans in populous center-right areas like Jacksonville.Heading west toward where Hurricane Michael has devastated coastal towns is the Panhandle. A ministate of sprawling military bases, pale beaches and seafood shacks, white clapboard churches and deep-red politics, this will be DeSantis Country.Tommy Williams, a politician in the small town of Graceville near the Alabama border, was once asked if he rooted for the Gators or the Seminoles in this college-football-crazed state. \u201cAre those my only choices?\u201d he said, taken aback. The locals are just as likely to root for Alabama\u2019s Crimson Tide or Auburn Tigers \u2014 proof of the old Florida adage that \u201cthe farther north you go, the farther south you get.\u201dBut North Florida is also home to some of the state\u2019s most wrenching poverty. Despite an economic boom, people in rural Marianna stand in line at food pantries on humid mornings, swatting away gnats as they wait for free servings of beans and rice.Mr. Gillum, raised in poverty in hardscrabble Richmond Heights, south of Miami, has spoken powerfully and in Christian terms about the need to address hardships lingering in Florida\u2019s trillion-dollar economy. And heavy turnout among poor and African-American voters in this region could yet make up for his losses elsewhere.Back down on the southwest side of the peninsula, from St. Petersburg south to Naples, is a sun-drenched extension of Interstate 75, where retired autoworkers and small-business owners from Michigan, Indiana and Ohio have brought their Rotary Club Midwestern politics down the highway.Reliably Republican with a moderate streak \u2014 dotted by both gated communities and mobile-home parks \u2014 southwest Florida is experiencing an epidemic of red tide and algae blooms in its waterways. Governor Scott dismantled regulation of the very industrial nutrients that fuel algae blooms. So Mr. Gillum, championing his environmentalism, has pounced on the renewed resonance of sustainability here.A fifth region, sometimes called Forgotten Florida, is the landlocked interior around Lake Okeechobee: rural, conservative, sure to vote heavily for Mr. DeSantis and home to \u201cBig Sugar,\u201d an enduring force in the state regardless of who\u2019s in power.The two parties, to maintain control, cling to an antiquated closed-primary system, locking out those without a registered partisan affiliation. Those off-the-radar voters, unleashed for the first time in November, could prove just as key as the get-out-the-vote efforts geared toward the partisan bases.Bill Nelson, the state\u2019s senior senator and the only remaining Democrat who holds statewide office, is campaigning side by side with Mr. Gillum, hoping the mayor\u2019s appeal to young liberals will help to fend off Governor Scott\u2019s well-funded challenge.Mr. Nelson, 76, who was first elected to state office in the Nixon landslide of 1972, personifies the old-fashioned, risk-averse centrist Democrat that so many of today\u2019s young progressives detest. But come November, political physics means he and Mr. Gillum will need each other\u2019s voters if either of them is going to win.Steve Bousquet is the Tallahassee bureau chief for The Tampa Bay Times.

It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L. Whitfield sermonized from the Gospel According to John. In one of the pews they built a dollhouse out of Bibles. Pastor Whitfield was baptized in the bayou that runs behind the church 54 years ago.

Stark, the little boy, stared out at all of this, a child of the desert in dank, humid air, and then he looked up at his father and said that when he grew up he was going to play professional soccer in Italy, and then he was going to come back to Florida and be a fishing guide.We set out to document 24 different hours in 24 states, to shine a lens on the lives of people rarely in the headlines.

In the intervening time, he came of age, worked as a contractor, had daughters and sons, built two churches with his own hands and led them, and saw his sons join the ministry and lead their own congregations in other Delta towns.His return to his spiritual birthplace was not a matter of if, but rather when \u2014 18 years ago this month.

{"Headline": "California Tenants Take Rent Control Fight to the Ballot Box", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 From pulpits across Los Angeles, Pastor Kelvin Sauls has spent the past few months delivering sermons on the spiritual benefits of fasting. The food in the sermon is rent, and landlords need less of it. \u201cMy role is to bring a moral perspective to what we are dealing with around the housing crisis,\u201d Pastor Sauls explained.Among those fighting the initiative is a relatively recent class of landlords \u2014 private equity firms like Blackstone Group, which accumulated a vast residential real estate portfolio after the housing market collapse a decade ago. Landlords warn that repealing the Costa-Hawkins law would create deep uncertainty among developers, making California\u2019s housing shortage worse by discouraging construction.\u201cThis is a serious problem, but the solution to that problem should not land solely on the rental housing industry,\u201d said Tom Bannon, president of the California Apartment Association, a landlords\u2019 group.\u201cWe\u2019re both watching and learning from how they are building this broad-based movement,\u201d said Lisa Owens, executive director of City Life/Vida Urbana, a tenants\u2019 rights group in Boston.Among the contributing factors are rising construction costs and increasingly stringent land-use regulations that have slowed construction and held back the supply of lower-cost rental housing. New building has skewed toward the upper end of the market, while the share of the overall housing stock affordable to lower-income renters has declined.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Eva Jimenez, who lives with her husband and four children in an Invitation Homes property in Oakland, answered her door in a \u201cYes on 10\u201d T-shirt (\u201cBecause the rent is too damn high,\u201d it said on the back). With rents rising, tenants who live in single-family homes that are ineligible for rent control, like Ms. Jimenez, have become active in the Proposition 10 campaign, and she is a member of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, which is running the \u201cYes on 10\u201d Campaign with the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.Given how confusing it can be to explain the Costa-Hawkins law and how the ballot initiative would change things, Ms. Jimenez said that when she distilled her pitch to \u201ceverything is about rent control,\u201d it resonated deeply with neighbors.Economists have an almost universally dim view of rent control laws, and a number have supported the landlords\u2019 contention that Proposition 10 could make California\u2019s housing problems worse. Under current law, California landlords can raise their rent as much as they like after a rent-controlled tenant leaves. If the Costa-Hawkins law is repealed, cities could write laws that barred them from ever raising their rents to market rates. That could prompt landlords to convert apartments into owner-occupied housing, worsening the shortage of affordable rentals.Tax credits are expensive to the state budget, however, and have little chance of becoming law any time soon. Rent control, by contrast, doesn\u2019t cost taxpayers anything in dollars, at least not right away, and despite the long-term concerns of economists, it has the potential to help tenants now.Repealing the Costa-Hawkins law has been a goal of tenant advocates almost since it was enacted in 1995. But given the shoestring budgets of community groups, there had been no sustained effort capable of funding a statewide political campaign.Enter Michael Weinstein, the president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation in Los Angeles. The foundation, the world\u2019s largest AIDS charity, is on a pace to generate some $2 billion a year in revenue in 2020, most of it from a chain of nonprofit pharmacies.Regardless of the outcome, the rent control battle seems unlikely to subside soon. Separate from Proposition 10, tenant activists have put rent control measures on the 2018 ballot in several California cities, and are gathering signatures for more after that.And Mr. Weinstein said that win or lose, he was not going away. If Proposition 10 fails, he has promised to pay for another bid to repeal the Costa-Hawkins law, possibly in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m kind of like gum on your shoe,\u201d he said.Lauren Hepler contributed reporting from Oakland, Calif.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "China May Need to Relax Its Lending Rules to Improve Economic Growth", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsChina is experiencing its slowest economic growth since 2009. Its credit system may need relaxing in order to help change that.China\u2019s gummed-up credit system is threatening economic growth and officials may have little choice but to let unregulated lenders step in.The nation\u2019s economy is not in desperate straits yet, but confidence appears shaken. The economy expanded 6.5 percent in the third quarter of 2018, missing expectations. Other indicators have suffered too: Fixed-asset investment growth has seen record lows, and retail sales have cooled.Officials have pushed for fiscal support \u2014 such as infrastructure spending \u2014 and have dropped unsubtle hints about easing the nation\u2019s deleveraging campaign. They have also suggested that banks lend more to small businesses.Unfortunately, China\u2019s banking system has a big transmission issue when it comes to offering credit to smaller borrowers. At the same time the country\u2019s correcting stock markets make it harder for private companies to raise funds via equity, or borrow using pledge shares. Bond issuance is difficult, too.Lending data for September showed that total social financing, a homegrown measure of total credit flow, increased to $320 billion, up almost 20 percent year-on-year. But when methodological changes are stripped out, aggregate lending grew only 10.6 percent \u2014 mostly from conventional loans.The problem is the weakness of so-called shadow banking \u2014 where money is provided by unregulated lenders \u2014 in China. The practice has been heavily constricted by new regulations: Two of the most important categories, new entrusted and trust loans, shrank by a combined 234 billion renminbi, or about $34 billion, in September, having contracted by 190 billion renminbi in August, according to calculations by the economist Ting Lu of Nomura.It is only a matter of time before policymakers are forced to loosen up. There is no question that China\u2019s shadow banking industry had become a place to hide a lot of poor quality loans, and officials will need to keep cleaning it up.

{"Headline": "Fan Bingbing, China\u2019s Most Famous Actress, Faces Huge Fines in Tax Evasion", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIJING \u2014 China accused the country\u2019s most famous actress, Fan Bingbing, of evading millions of dollars in taxes and warned others in the television and film industry to come clean or face a similar fate, according to a statement released to state media on Wednesday.The authorities fined Ms. Fan, 37, the equivalent of nearly $70 million in unpaid taxes and penalties after an investigation found that she and employees of her production company had underreported her earnings from her blockbuster films \u2014 a practice that is said to be common in China, and not only in the entertainment industry.The tax authorities in Beijing and Jiangsu, the province where her production company is based, said that since this was Ms. Fan\u2019s first offense, she would not face criminal charges as long as she and her company paid her fine and an additional $60 million in back taxes owed by her company.\u201cI have been through pain and suffering I have never had before,\u201d Ms. Fan wrote in a post on Weibo, the Twitter-like website, her first since June 2. \u201cI have had deep and profound self-reflection. I feel shamed and guilty for what I have done.\u201dOthers will face charges, though. In a statement released to the state news media, the authorities cited potentially criminal actions by the company\u2019s employees, including obstruction of the tax investigation. The statement said that one person \u2014 her agent, Mou Enguang, according to news reports \u2014 was taken into custody.Ms. Fan\u2019s prominence suggests that the authorities intended to send a broader signal with the investigation.As China\u2019s economy boomed, the government has struggled to collect taxes from private companies and individuals. Problems with taxation have become more urgent as the country encounters new economic headwinds, after years of uninterrupted growth.Tax evasion is so rampant that enforcement, when it does occur, is often seen as arbitrary or politically motivated.When it comes to the entertainment industry, which is heavily censored in China, the government is particularly sensitive to the influence its stars\u2019 behavior can have \u2014 for better or worse \u2014 on public opinion.The State Tax Administration warned in the statement that others in the entertainment industry could also face investigations unless they stepped forward to declare untaxed income. It set a deadline of Dec. 31, promising that those who complied voluntarily would not have to pay penalties.For Ms. Fan, the reputational damage has already been done. She was, until this summer, one of the most recognizable women in China, having appeared in dozens of movies and television series and achieved global recognition with roles in the \u201cX-Men\u201d and \u201cIron Man\u201d franchises.The fate of that role, as well as numerous branding contracts that were abruptly canceled or suspended since then, remains to be seen. Her current whereabouts is not known, though there have been unsubstantiated reports that she has been detained during the course of the investigation.Ms. Fan\u2019s abrupt fall from public grace has been one of the biggest news sensations in China in recent months, worrying fans and colleagues while delighting others who relished the travails of a rich celebrity.In commentary that censors appeared to be trying to suppress, people reacted online on Wednesday with both gleeful disdain and also incredulity that so large an instance of tax evasion merited only a fine.\u201cOrdinary people who earn a little salary still need to pay taxes honestly,\u201d one user on Weibo wrote.The practice of having dual contracts \u2014 known as \u201cyin and yang\u201d contracts \u2014 is widespread in many industries. Mr. Cui\u2019s anger appeared to be directed as much toward the director of \u201cCell Phone,\u201d Feng Xiaogang, as toward Ms. Fan. Mr. Cui previously had accused him of slander because the plot \u2014 in which a prominent television anchor has an affair with an assistant, played by Ms. Fan \u2014 bore striking, though he said inaccurate, parallels to Mr. Cui\u2019s own career.In that case, the authorities said, Ms. Fan signed an actual contract for 20 million yuan, nearly $3 million, but declared only 10 million yuan in the contract submitted to the tax authorities.The film\u2019s release, originally scheduled for August, has also been delayed, and her role reportedly edited out.In addition to her apology, Ms. Fan offered an extraordinary statement of fealty to the state and the Communist Party which controls it for her career successes so far.\u201cWithout the party and the state\u2019s good policies, without the love from the people, there would have been no Fan Bingbing,\u201d she wrote.Austin Ramzy contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

{"Headline": "Not Just for Grown-Ups: The Broadway Audience Is Getting Younger", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA scene from \u201cAnastasia,\u201d one of many shows now running on Broadway that have helped bring in younger audiences.The Broadway audience is getting younger.Fifteen percent of all theatergoers were under 18 years old, the report found. Musical audiences were much younger than play audiences \u2014 the average age at a musical was 39, while at a play it was 51.5.\u201cThe trend is real \u2014 it\u2019s not just a fluke,\u201d said Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the Broadway League, which has made a concerted effort to introduce young people to theater, in part by bringing high school sophomores to shows. \u201cAnd it\u2019s not a big surprise when you look at the offerings. We just launched our fall program, and there are now 17 shows that teachers say are acceptable for 16-year-olds, which tells you something \u2014 10 years ago we might have had five or six.\u201dAmong the report\u2019s other noteworthy findings:\u2022 The percentage of the Broadway audience made up of people from the New York area is continuing to rise, after years in which tourists had seemed to be crowding out the locals. Last season, 38 percent of Broadway patrons were from the New York metro area (including 20 percent from New York City). That matters for two major reasons: locals are much more likely than tourists to attend nonmusical plays, so their presence helps shore up that fragile part of the theater economy, and local residents provide a stabilizing base for Broadway in periods when geopolitical or economic events might unsettle tourism traffic.\u2022 The audience remains disproportionately female (66 percent), white (75 percent), quite affluent (average annual household income: $222,120), and highly educated (among those 25 and older, 81 percent had a college degree and 41 percent had a graduate degree). But the League highlighted one hopeful bit of data on this front: Over the last seven years, attendance by Hispanics has grown by 61 percent, to 8.2 percent of the overall audience. The audience is 8.5 percent Asian and 2.9 percent black.\u2022 A whopping 31 percent of tickets were bought by people who attend 15 or more performances a year.The data is based on an annual audience survey, and for the first time the League asked patrons about their exposure to theater as children. Two-thirds of those surveyed said someone in their family had taken them to the theater when they were young.Advertisement"}

The American economy and financial markets are the largest in the world, and there are no good alternatives.In the long run, however, the rest of the world might get its wish. The dollar\u2019s status as the dominant global reserve currency is the result of faith in America\u2019s strong institutions. This includes the checks and balances among different arms of government, the rule of law and an independent central bank. These institutions have proved durable and earned the trust of global investors, who see the dollar as a safe haven in troubled times. But President Trump and his acolytes are undermining those very institutions with their words and actions.Other countries have long chafed at the dollar\u2019s dominance in global finance. Nearly two-thirds of the foreign exchange reserves held by the world\u2019s central banks\u2019, essentially their rainy-day funds, are held in dollars. It is the currency used to denominate and settle a significant part of international financial transactions. Almost all commodity contracts, including those for oil, are priced and settled in dollars.This gives the United States a lot of power. Since dollar transactions usually involve the American banking system, the United States government can put a chokehold on countries like Iran and Russia by limiting their access to global finance.In the past, none of this would have made a dent in the dollar\u2019s dominance. No other country has the unmatchable combination of size, trust and influence enjoyed by the United States. The global ripple effects of last week\u2019s stock market fluctuations were a clear illustration.But the Trump administration, and its allies in Congress, are wreaking havoc on the institutions that have made the dollar dominant for so long.The rule of law is being eviscerated by an administration that is openly venal and sees itself as above the law. And stacking the courts with judges who are chosen for their willingness to advance a particular agenda is eroding confidence in the judicial system.The dollar\u2019s dominance may outlast the Trump era, but it is not inevitable. If the president continues to hack away at America\u2019s institutions, the dollar, too, will suffer. This might end up becoming one of the biggest scars the administration leaves on the American economy.Eswar Prasad is a professor at Cornell University, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and author of \u201cThe Dollar Trap: How the U.S. Dollar Tightened Its Grip on Global Finance.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Update: Kurdistan and the Battle Over Oil", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn an election that did not capture the attention of most of the world, residents of the semiautonomous Kurdistan region of Iraq voted in a parliamentary election last Sunday \u2014 a year after a failed vote for independence. The election, whose results have been hotly debated, is the latest chapter in the long and tortured struggle over control of the oil-rich region. What makes Kurdistan \u2014 and Kurdish oil \u2014 so important?Kurdistan\u2019s neighbors \u2014 with their own restive Kurdish minorities \u2014 worry that oil will fuel the Kurdish push for independence from Iraq. Kurdish autonomy, they fear, would destroy the already precarious equilibrium in the region. Kurdish statehood is the last thing the Iranians, the Turks and the Iraqis want.Well, first and foremost, the Islamic State happened. Although ISIS (also known as ISIL, for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant) was years in the making; by late June 2014 its impact on Kurdistan was huge. I was in Baghdad back then and recall the media reports that ISIS fighters were within 30 miles of Irbil, the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan. Having fighters so close terrified the oil expatriates who had gone to Kurdistan and turned it into a petroleum boomtown. The parties ended. The construction stopped. Shopping malls and the high-rise apartments were left half built as oil prices plummeted.In short, Kurdistan\u2019s economy was hit by the financial and humanitarian costs of the war against ISIS and a collapse in business confidence. This led to an exodus of international oil companies and other key investors. The result was a severe financial crisis from which the region has yet to recover. Oil prices have bounced back, but it has become clear that Kurdistan\u2019s oil reserves were overstated and that the region\u2019s production is not sufficient to cover its operational costs.How did the failed independence referendum impact Kurdistan\u2019s oil output, and what\u2019s the situation like now?The 2017 referendum was catastrophic in terms of the Kurdish economy and oil production. Shortly after 92 percent of Kurds voted to leave Iraq, Baghdad and the regional countries responded harshly. The most brutal response was that the disputed oil producing city of Kirkuk fell to Iraqi forces. The city was taken out of the Kurds\u2019s hands after they had fought a hard battle to liberate it from ISIS. It was a bitter humiliation, a political suicide for Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, who resigned. But most of all, it denied the Kurds of the Kirkuk oil. What\u2019s keeping Kurdistan from reaching its full oil-production potential? How so? Are you optimistic about the future of Kurdistan to ultimately develop as both a nation and major oil producer.I would like to be, because I love Kurdistan \u2014 I love Iraq. I\u2019ve been working there since the time of Saddam Hussein. But signs are not positive. In January, the United States Institute of Peace issued a report that said that Kurdistan was on the brink of \u201ceconomic collapse.\u201d A rapid solution is needed, and will most likely have to come from the central government in Baghdad, to reassure investors that they are needed to rebuild Kurdistan after ISIS tore it to shreds. The only way for that to happen is for the two to renegotiate Kurdish oil policy and revenue sharing in terms of the Iraqi national budget. That is the core of it.In terms of Kurdistan becoming independent, the country must develop core institutions which they have failed to do \u2014 there must be rule of law and transparency and the level of corruption must be crushed. Both Baghdad and Irbil point fingers and offer accusations, but the lack of transparency is at the core of the distrust. Iraq has a Kurdish president, Barham Salih, as part of the new government in Baghdad. How might this new leadership change things?Advertisement"}

But remember: It\u2019s just one poll, and we talked to only 501 people. Each candidate\u2019s total could easily be five points different if we polled everyone in the district. And having a small sample is only one possible source of error. To preserve privacy, exact addresses have been concealed. The locations shown here are approximate.Based on 501 interviewsBased on 501 interviewsThis district, in the exurbs west of Chicago, has long had a Republican bent. Dennis Hastert, the longest-serving Republican Speaker of the House in history, represented it from 1987 to 2007.Other organizations\u2019 ratings:Previous election results:It\u2019s generally best to look at a single poll in the context of other polls:Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. I\u2019ll give you the latest reporting and intel on the midterms and take your questions from the campaign trail.As we reach more people, our poll will become more stable and the margin of sampling error will shrink. The changes in the timeline below reflect that sampling error, not real changes in the race.One reason we\u2019re doing these surveys live is so you can see the uncertainty for yourself. There\u2019s a big question on top of the standard margin of error in a poll: Who is going to vote? It\u2019s a particularly challenging question this year, since special elections have shown Democrats voting in large numbers.To estimate the likely electorate, we combine what people say about how likely they are to vote with information about how often they have voted in the past. In previous races, this approach has been more accurate than simply taking people at their word. But there are many other ways to do it.All estimates based on 501 interviewsJust because one candidate leads in all of these different turnout scenarios doesn\u2019t mean much by itself. They don\u2019t represent the full range of possible turnout scenarios, let alone the full range of possible election results.Even if we got turnout exactly right, the margin of error wouldn\u2019t capture all of the error in a poll. The simplest version assumes we have a perfect random sample of the voting population. We do not.People who respond to surveys are almost always too old, too white, too educated and too politically engaged to accurately represent everyone.Based on administrative records. Some characteristics are missing or incorrect. Many voters are called multiple times.Pollsters compensate by giving more weight to respondents from under-represented groups. But weighting works only if you weight by the right categories and you know what the composition of the electorate will be. In 2016, many pollsters didn\u2019t weight by education and overestimated Hillary Clinton\u2019s standing as a result.Here are other common ways to weight a poll:All estimates based on 501 interviewsJust because one candidate leads in all of these different weighting scenarios doesn\u2019t mean much by itself. They don\u2019t represent the full range of possible weighting scenarios, let alone the full range of possible election results.About 10 percent of voters said that they were undecided or refused to tell us whom they would vote for. If they were to break 3 to 1 in favor of Democrats, that alone would be enough to change the lead in our poll, assuming we did everything else perfectly. (We could also be wrong on turnout or our sample could be unrepresentative. Or other voters could change their minds.)We're also asking voters about feminism and whether they think it's important to elect more women to public office.Percentages are weighted to resemble likely voters.Percentages are weighted to resemble likely voters; the number of respondents in each subgroup is unweighted.

{"Headline": "Recovering the (Lost) Art of Civility", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFixesDeepening political divisions in America are spurring acts of extreme violence. What will it take to regain civil discourse that serves common interests? Can anything be done to reduce the acrimony in American society?Mr. Fairman has had success working on many issues, including human rights, climate change, economic development, education and criminal justice policy. He has the rare talent of envisioning pathways forward through what appear to be intractable conflicts. I asked him to reflect on the divide in America today.But it\u2019s not only the electoral machinery. Since the Republicans won back the House of Representatives in 1994, it\u2019s been a much fiercer competition between the two parties than at most times since the Civil War. When you see yourself as the minority party for the long term, you have incentives to cooperate with the majority party to move some parts of your agenda. But when you think that you might win back control soon, there\u2019s a strong incentive to just hold out and fight. On the other hand, when you gain control, you know it might not last, so you want to maximize your wins and use whatever tactics you can to overcome opposition. We\u2019ve seen both parties doing this since the 1990s. And when you play win-lose politics fiercely for more than 20 years, voters adopt that mind-set too \u2014 or they become so frustrated that they tune out.There are also deep societal issues at play: demographic shifts, an economy that is changing fast and causing a lot of anxiety, and the culture wars. But we don\u2019t have to have strong partisan divisions on all those issues, and there have been times in our recent history when we haven\u2019t been so divided.Without that experience of being heard, people will keep on turning the conversation back to how we got here and who\u2019s at fault, and it\u2019s very hard to move forward.They could feed back the main points of their conversations to the state level, where they\u2019d be reviewed by party leaders, who would also be in regular, private conversation with each other. After six months, or longer if it seemed useful, there could be some public reflection and discussion.I\u2019m confident that a process like that with some design and facilitation from people who are independent could bring the partisan heat down, build relationships and make it harder to demonize each other, even if it didn\u2019t lead to agreement on the issues. Party machinery matters. It works. It\u2019s not hard for them to deliver activists to a room if they decide they really want to do this.Some organizations and projects that focus on supporting civil dialogue:Some organizations focused on conflict resolution and consensus building:Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Hails Revised Nafta Trade Deal, and Sets Up a Showdown With China", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said Monday that the revised North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada would pour \u201ccash and jobs\u201d into the United States. But the deal\u2019s importance may have less to do with the details than the signal it sends that Mr. Trump is methodically settling his multifront trade war to fight a single enemy: China.A jubilant Mr. Trump celebrated the new Nafta agreement as the fulfillment of a bedrock campaign promise. He claimed it was a vindication of his aggressive use of tariffs and vowed to keep imposing them to extract deals from other trading partners, like the European Union and Japan.But while Mr. Trump expressed confidence about eventually reaching deals with Europe and Japan, he was far more grudging about China, saying it was too soon to begin talking. Administration officials say privately that Mr. Trump is content to leave tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods in place for the foreseeable future to weaken its hand.\u201cChina wants to talk very badly,\u201d Mr. Trump said at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden. \u201cI said frankly it\u2019s too early to talk, because they\u2019re not ready.\u201d He added, \u201cIf politically, people force it too quickly, you\u2019re not going to make the right deal.\u201d[Alan Rappeport, a Times reporter, answered questions about the new trade deal between the U.S., Mexico and Canada.]With a deal safely in hand, Mr. Trump lavished praise on Mexico\u2019s outgoing president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, with whom he had tangled repeatedly over the phone. He was less effusive about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, but suggested their Cold War was over, too. It was not personal, Mr. Trump suggested about both men; it was just business.\u201cWe had very strong tensions,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cIt was just an unfair deal, whether it was Mexico or Canada, and now it\u2019s a fair deal for everybody. It\u2019s a much different deal. It\u2019s a brand-new deal. It\u2019s not Nafta redone.\u201dStill, like some of Mr. Trump\u2019s other accomplishments in business and government, the deal is partly a step forward and partly an exercise in rebranding.Canada will ease longstanding protections on its dairy market and provide access greater than what the United States would have gained through the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade treaty negotiated by President Barack Obama, from which Mr. Trump withdrew last year.The United States relented on its demand to eliminate an independent tariff dispute settlement system that Canada had said was a red line. Preserving it was a major concession for the United States, which had eliminated the mechanism, known as Chapter 19, as part of its deal with Mexico.The pact also makes a series of changes to areas like intellectual property and the digital economy, including protections for patents and domain names \u2014 all of which refresh Nafta, a 25-year-old pact that had become somewhat outmoded in the digital age.But many of these innovations were drawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which included Canada and Mexico, and it prompted a senior Trump adviser to offer a rare endorsement of an Obama legacy achievement that Mr. Trump delighting in dismantling.\u201cWe\u2019re building on what was done in T.P.P.,\u201d said Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative. \u201cI\u2019m in no way trying to knock the people that negotiated T.P.P.\u201dBut he added, \u201cBecause we had the benefit of that, our agreement is substantially better than T.P.P.\u201dMr. Lighthizer pointed to changes in regulations governing automobile manufacturing, which he said would bring more car production back to the United States. Under the agreement, a greater percentage of vehicles would have to be made in North America to qualify for Nafta\u2019s zero tariffs.A significant portion of the vehicles would also have to be assembled by workers earning at least $16 an hour \u2014 a wage floor intended to increase jobs in the United States and Canada, where wages are higher than in Mexico. While inflation will erode this wage protection over time, officials noted that the pact\u2019s terms could be reviewed every six years.Analysts said the agreement might have an incremental impact on American automotive jobs, and might push car prices slightly higher. But Ford Motor Company said in a statement that it was \u201cencouraged\u201d by the accord, noting that a three-nation trade zone \u201cwill support an integrated, globally competitive automotive business in North America.\u201dThe United Steelworkers union urged caution, lamenting that the Trump administration\u2019s steel and aluminum tariffs had not been lifted as part of the deal. The commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, described those as \u201cseparate issues,\u201d and Mexico and Canada say they expect those tariffs to be worked out on a separate track. Mr. Trump said the United States was talking with Mexico and Canada about potentially replacing them with quotas. Also unresolved is whether Canada and Mexico will continue retaliatory tariffs on American products like whiskey, orange juice and chocolate.Mr. Trump must now submit the deal to Congress, where a potential change in control from Republicans to Democrats could throw its passage into doubt. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, made clear on Monday that Mr. Trump\u2019s deal would not receive a rubber stamp.But the top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer of New York, offered a rare endorsement of Mr. Trump\u2019s approach.\u201cAs someone who voted against Nafta and opposed it for many years, I knew it needed fixing. The president deserves praise for taking large steps to improve it,\u201d Mr. Schumer said in a statement. He cautioned, though, that \u201cany final agreement must be judged on how it benefits and protects middle-class families and the working people in our country.\u201dExperts on trade delivered a mixed verdict on the agreement. Parts of it, they said, were a much-needed update to Nafta. But other parts could restrict trade in a way that would ultimately hurt American consumers and increase uncertainty for American companies.\u201cHe started this conflagration with Mexico and Canada, as he has with other trading partners,\u201d said Daniel M. Price, a former trade adviser to President George W. Bush. \u201cThat he may put out the fires after they have destroyed significant acreage does not vindicate either the strategy or the result.\u201d\u201cThey finally got their act together and decided they can\u2019t win all these wars, so they\u2019re settling many of them and focusing on China,\u201d said Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior fellow and trade expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \u201cThey\u2019re lining up the ducks for this gigantic battle with China.\u201dThere are no plans for trade negotiations between China and the United States, although the president\u2019s chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said Mr. Trump might meet President Xi Jinping of China at a summit meeting in Argentina in late November.On Monday, Mr. Trump raised the prospect of even more tariffs against China and said his actions were taking a toll on the Chinese economy.Although he voiced hopes about a deal with the European Union \u2014 and praised Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president with whom he agreed to hold off on auto tariffs \u2014 White House officials said the negotiations with Europe would be arduous.Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s senior adviser and son-in-law, played a significant role in smoothing over the final sticking points between the United States and Canada, according to officials. He met informally with the Canadian foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, during the transition, and kept in touch with her, even as Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with Mr. Trudeau became fraught.\u201cThe relationship that we\u2019ve been able to build with the countries established a lot of trust, both with the Canadians and Mexicans,\u201d Mr. Kushner told reporters. \u201cIt was through that trust that we were able to talk about a lot of these issues.\u201dMr. Trump and Mr. Trudeau spoke by telephone Monday morning, though Mr. Trudeau later dodged questions about whether the agreement would restore his relationship with the president.\u201cThe relationship between the U.S. and Canadians is much deeper than just the relationship between two individuals who happen to be prime minister and president,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said.At the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump exulted in the abbreviation for the new agreement, U.S.M.C.A., which he predicted that \u201c99 percent of the time we\u2019ll be hearing.\u201dThat rebranding, however, may prove to be one of Mr. Trump\u2019s biggest challenges. Even in his briefing with reporters afterward, Mr. Lighthizer, a veteran trade lawyer, referred to the deal as Nafta.Neal E. Boudette in Ann Arbor, Mich., contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Unemployment Looks Like 2000 Again. But Wage Growth Doesn\u2019t.", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrying to solve an economic mystery. Lots of measures are telling us that the United States labor market is doing well. In some cases, very well. So in many ways, the labor market looks like the economic heyday of 2000 and 2001, but in one important way it does not: wage growth.The government has several wage metrics that take different approaches, each with pros and cons. But virtually all of these agree that wage growth today is much slower now than it was on the eve of the 2001 recession, with its identical unemployment rate.This is, to put it mildly, a mystery. If workers are as scarce as the unemployment rate and many other measures suggest, employers should be raising wages to compete for them.The most widely followed wage measures grew at an average of around 2.9 percent over the past year. Wage growth is certainly stronger than in the depths of the recession in 2009 and 2010, and has been gradually increasing since then. But it is still well below the 4.2 percent average right before the 2001 recession.So why has wage growth slowed since 2001, across many different measures, when unemployment is so low?We can rule out two possible reasons immediately. It wasn\u2019t because of a decline in inflation, and it wasn\u2019t because benefits like health insurance and hiring bonuses crowded out wages.As with wages, the government has many different inflation measures. But none that we analyzed have slowed by nearly enough since 2001 to explain the weakness in wage growth; some have even increased a bit.Another possibility is that slower wage growth is simply a side effect of the changing composition of the American work force since 2001 \u2014 for example, a work force that is older than it used to be. But this hypothesis is also mostly wrong. Using the Current Population Survey to calculate wages across a variety of demographic and labor market categories \u2014 including age, sex, education and race/ethnicity \u2014 we find that wage growth is consistently slower now than in 2001. It\u2019s only when we begin to split up the data by geography that we find a group for whom wages have recovered to their 2001 pace \u2014 and in fact, now exceed it: nonmetro workers in the West South Central census division (Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana).Supporting this theory: If we look at wage growth by the industry of the worker, mining and extraction stands out as being the only one where typical wage growth is above 2001 levels.Economists do not agree on what\u2019s driving lower wage growth, but they have several hypotheses.One is that there\u2019s more slack in the labor market today than the unemployment rate suggests. Slack is essentially the shortfall between the amount of work the economy could be supporting and the amount it actually is.The unemployment rate counts only people either employed or actively looking for work \u2014 not those who give up looking. A rise in what economists call labor force nonparticipation \u2014 whether because of discouragement, school enrollment, disability or retirement \u2014 was a distinguishing feature of the Great Recession.The Current Population Survey does not track worker productivity, but it does show that occupations of all skill requirements \u2014 even high-skilled ones \u2014 are seeing wage growth down from 2001.This suggests that if the productivity slowdown is a factor in slow wage growth, it\u2019s a pervasive one across occupations.A third hypothesis is that weaker wage growth is connected to inequality and lower labor bargaining power.However, rising inequality and falling unionization may be affecting wage growth in more indirect ways, such as in lower upward mobility and weaker bargaining power. Also, some of the same economic forces feeding into them may also be influencing wage growth.One thing is clear: Although the unemployment rate may look the way it did in boom times in 2000, for many Americans wage growth has much further to go.Ernie Tedeschi is an economist and head of fiscal analysis at Evercore ISI.

{"Headline": "How One Climate Reporter Helps Readers Care About Kelp", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byI don\u2019t remember how I learned that climate change is threatening kelp. As a climate reporter at The New York Times and previously at Popular Science, I\u2019ve read a lot of studies, so they can kind of blur. I do remember seeing an image of an intact kelp forest \u2014 giant, gauzy strands of green, suspended against an ethereal blue backdrop. When I posted a Twitter thread recently that included a photo of a kelp forest, one reader said it reminded her of \u201cHarry Potter.\u201d It makes sense: Even Hogwarts has kelp forests.But I also knew that few people would read a story about kelp. When I brought up the subject at parties while I was working on the article, people would kindly find ways to extricate themselves from me, which isn\u2019t the best sign. Kelp lives underwater in cooler waters, so most people either don\u2019t see it or only do when it\u2019s washed up on beaches, dead. Not exactly the most compelling topic.So I looked for a human story that could carry this scientific truth and turn it into a narrative. That\u2019s how I learned not only that climate change has driven the loss of kelp forests in Northern California, destroyed fisheries and hurt the local economy, but that people there are actively trying to undo the harm.Narratives are important for climate-change stories, because climate change can be a bit of a downer. We are, after all, talking about whether humans will continue to survive. It can be exhausting hearing about communities struck by hurricanes, drowned by rising seas or destroyed by fire.But the human brain is wired for stories. That\u2019s part of why the article began with Josh Russo, a recreational fisheries advocate, talking about \u201cevil\u201d purple urchins that because of climate change are destroying the kelp forest \u2014 it\u2019s a classic storytelling device. The urchin becomes a character, without anthropomorphizing, which I try to avoid.When it comes to laying out the science, the rule of thumb is to imagine that the reader is smart but uninformed. This means keeping jargon to a minimum. I try to define terms as soon as I use them. And I insert size comparisons that make intuitive sense (purple urchins are the size of a plum). As science reporters, we also have to keep tying the science back to the central narrative. It helps to have good editors.I anchored the story in two Northern California fisheries because that setting was helpful to convey the science. And the idea that climate change can destroy your livelihood is something most people can connect with, even if they\u2019ve never seen the ocean. But picking a narrative means excluding other ones. California\u2019s coastal tribes depend on the abalone that dine on kelp and are suffering. But I couldn\u2019t find a way to fit their story \u2014 which is every bit as haunting \u2014 into the article without giving it short shrift.A lot of climate change stories are pretty straightforward: It got hot, and something terrible happened. But in this story, climate change helped trigger a series of events that led to the collapse of the kelp forest. I had to describe every step in that process. That meant a lot more chances to get the science wrong, or to lose readers. Needless to say, I didn\u2019t sleep well Sunday night before the article was posted online. But when I woke up on Monday to supportive, if disheartened, emails from readers, I knew that I had gotten it right.The one thing I hadn\u2019t anticipated was the number of people who wanted to solve the problem by eating the purple urchins. Under normal conditions, purple urchins reach food stage in the fall and winter, when ocean currents would make it especially dangerous for harvesters to go out and get them. But these aren\u2019t normal conditions. There isn\u2019t much food in the purple urchins, because they\u2019re starving, too. As is often the case in literary narratives, even this \u201cvillain\u201d is a victim of its environment, which has some broader parallels to humans. We\u2019re both causing climate change and suffering because of it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What Could Kill Booming U.S. Economy? \u2018Socialists,\u2019 White House Warns", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA report from the Council of Economic Advisers compares Bernie Sanders to Chairman Mao, and warns that pickup trucks cost more in Sweden. Karl Marx. Vladimir Lenin. Mao Zedong. Elizabeth Warren?The word \u201csocialism\u201d appears 144 times \u2014 on average, twice a page.In case the point was lost on anyone, the message was driven home by a follow-up release from the White House press office with the headline \u201cCongressional Democrats Want to Take Money From Hardworking Americans to Fund Failed Socialist Policies.\u201dThe report does not shy away from lumping in liberal politicians and their policy proposals, such as Medicare for All and tuition-free college, with the atrocities committed by authoritarian regimes. For example, it compares Lenin\u2019s demonization of kulaks, or yeoman farmers, to Ms. Warren\u2019s critiques of the behavior of some large corporations. The report asserts that both are attacks on \u201coppressors of the vulnerable.\u201dThe Soviet government seized land from kulaks, killing many of them. Ms. Warren says corporations should pay higher taxes and be subject to more stringent government regulation. So, not exactly beets to beets.Here\u2019s a snapshot of what the White House put out on Tuesday:The meat of the council\u2019s report is a detailed accounting of the human costs of oppressive socialist governments throughout history, and it summarizes the results of one of the greatest natural experiments in economic history: During the half-century after World War II, economic growth of the Western democracies and a few countries in East Asia vastly outstripped growth in the communist bloc.Even into the 1980s, some prominent liberals continued to insist that communism was delivering superior economic results. But the fall of the Berlin Wall ended that argument. The conclusions of the report regarding the 20th century are essentially undisputed, at least by mainstream politicians in the United States: \u201cWhile socialism was supposed to make people more equal and allow the poor to escape oppression, it was the end of socialism that brought more than a billion people out of poverty and made world incomes more equal.\u201d Hammering away on that point, the report mentions Cuba, China and the U.S.S.R. more than 30 times each. But the star of the report is Venezuela, which is mentioned nearly 60 times. The report estimates that emulating Venezuelan economic policies would cause the American economy to shrink by 40 percent. It\u2019s something that Mr. Trump has repeatedly suggested Democrats want to do, but neither the president nor the report presents any evidence and no Democratic candidate has come anywhere close to embracing Venezuela\u2019s policies.The report acknowledges that these democratic socialists don\u2019t see themselves as the heirs of, say, Lenin. It specifically notes that they\u2019re not advocating violence. But it nonetheless seeks to connect liberals and their policy proposals to past socialist regimes. \u201cThere are proposals on the table, like the \u2018Medicare for All\u2019 proposal, that are very consistent with the design of socialism,\u201d Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the council, told reporters during a conference call to discuss the report on Tuesday.The report frequently adopts the facile tactic of comparing or lumping leading liberal politicians and demagogues. For example:The Chinese leader Mao Zedong, who cited Marxism as the model for his country, described \u201cthe ruthless economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants by the landlord class\u201d (Cotterell 2011, chap. 6). Expressing similar concerns, current American senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have stated that \u201clarge corporations . . . exploit human misery and insecurity, and turn them into huge profits\u201d and \u201cgiant corporations . . . exploit workers just to boost their own profits.And here:And even in the footnotes:\u201cSpeculators\u201d are also blamed for high prices and other social problems, as by Marx, Stalin, Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and Fidel Castro, who said that they \u201chave turned the planet into a giant casino.\u201dWhen liberals speak fondly of democratic socialism, they often point to Scandinavia \u2014 and a set of higher-tax countries that provide more robust government services and safety nets to their citizens. The report acknowledges this \u2014 and then walks a fine line around it.First, the council notes all the ways that Nordic countries don\u2019t necessarily comport with a liberal ideal of government, including a heavy middle-class tax burden and lighter-than-you-might-expect regulation of business.But even then, it contends, Nordic economies do not deliver in the way that the American economy does. That\u2019s true in terms of per-capita income \u2026 \u2026 and in terms of pickup truck ownership. That\u2019s right. Pickups. It\u2019s a strange question to ask at the end of a 72-page report, but it\u2019s one that the authors leave up for debate. Most important, they don\u2019t define as \u201csocialist\u201d anything that the United States government currently does.The federal government has long embraced important elements of a socialist agenda, such as providing retirement benefits and health care for poor children and older people. The report finesses this inconvenient truth by defining socialism as any effort to increase the government\u2019s involvement in the economy. Thus the current Medicare program, which provides socialized medicine for older Americans, is defined as ideologically acceptable, while proposals to expand Medicaid are termed \u201csocialized medicine.\u201dFor classical socialists, \u201ccommunism\u201d is a purely theoretical concept that has never yet been put into practice, which is why the second \u201cS\u201d in U.S.S.R. stands for \u201cSocialist.\u201d Communism is, in their view, a social arrangement where there is neither a state nor private property; the abolition of property is not sufficient for communism. As Lenin explained, \u201cThe goal of socialism is communism.\u201d The supposed purpose of the \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d was for China to transition from socialism to communism before the U.S.S.R. did (Dik\u04e7tter 2010). The classical definition therefore stands in contrast to vernacular usage of communism to refer to historical instances of socialism where the degree of control was the highest, such as the U.S.S.R., Cuba, North Korea, or Maoist China. This report therefore avoids the term \u201ccommunism.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Far-Right Candidate Jair Bolsonaro Widens Lead in Brazil\u2019s Presidential Race", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut Jair Bolsonaro, the populist, far-right candidate leading the pack, spent much of the final stretch in a hospital bed, convalescing from a near-fatal stabbing, occasionally posting selfies and shaky videos in which he looked feeble and groggy. His near-disappearance from the political stage only increased his lead: polls suggest Mr. Bolsonaro will trounce opponents in the election on Sunday.His success has defied the laws of political gravity. Until recently, Mr. Bolsonaro was a provocateur on the fringes of power who accomplished little as a seven-term lawmaker, but made headlines by calling for a military dictatorship and verbally attacking women, gays and people of color \u2014 in a country that is mostly nonwhite.Until early August, he did not even have a running mate because traditional parties and politicians found him toxic.But much like President Trump and populist leaders around the world, Mr. Bolsonaro has tapped into a deep well of resentment at the political establishment. He channeled Brazilians\u2019 anger over staggering levels of corruption and crime, presenting himself as the only candidate tough enough to solve them.\u201cBrazilians want a hero,\u201d said Daniel Machado, a professor of political marketing, referring to Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s vow to take radical measures to fix Brazil.\u201cWe need to break that system together,\u201d Mr. Bolsonaro, 63, told followers earlier this week during one of his daily live videos on Facebook.A year ago, most power brokers in Brazil regarded Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s presidential bid as fanciful, deeming him too incendiary to take the helm of the world\u2019s fourth largest democracy. Veteran political strategists and analysts thought his appeal would ebb as the campaign season officially kicked off in August.After all, Mr. Bolsonaro is also the most reviled contender in the field, with a 45 percent disapproval rate. But as Election Day approaches, centrist candidates with larger war chests and robust networks of support are seeing their political base drift toward Mr. Bolsonaro.His popularity only grew after he was stabbed while being carried by supporters during a political rally in September. The assailant told police officers at the scene that he was carrying out \u201can order from God,\u201d which led investigators to question his mental health. But the attack played into Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s message about the need to get tough on crime, analysts said.But many of his backers argue that he represents the only way to defeat the most powerful and corrupt presence on the Brazilian political scene in recent years \u2014 the leftist Workers\u2019 Party, which governed from 2003 to 2016.When the presidential race got underway, former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a charismatic former metal worker and founding member of the Workers\u2019 Party, was the front-runner by a wide margin. Many Brazilians, particularly the poor and the working class in this deeply unequal country, identify with Mr. da Silva personally and long for the prosperity they experienced during his tenure. He stepped down in 2011 with record-high approval ratings.Since then, the party\u2019s standing has slipped. Mr. da Silva\u2019s successor, Dilma Rousseff, oversaw the deepest recession in Brazil\u2019s history. She was impeached in 2016 for obscuring a budget deficit.So less than a month before Election Day, the Workers\u2019 Party officially nominated Fernando Haddad, a former education minister and mayor of S\u00e3o Paulo, betting that Mr. da Silva\u2019s base would transfer its allegiance to him. This was effective enough to push Mr. Haddad \u2014 a 55-year-old economist, lawyer and history professor with little national name recognition \u2014 into second place in the polls.The matchup between Mr. Bolsonaro and Mr. Haddad has crystallized a bitter societal divide in Brazil that has widened in recent years amid the economic woes and public disgust at bribery schemes that tainted much of the political and business elite.While foes see a Bolsonaro presidency as potentially catastrophic for the country\u2019s young democracy, his supporters warn that returning the Workers\u2019 Party to power would put Brazil on the type of ruinous path that has engulfed neighboring Venezuela.\u201cI lived through the era of the dictatorship and not even then did I witness so much hate, so much division, so much aggression,\u201d said Clara Strauss, 79, during a recent demonstration against Mr. Bolsonaro. \u201cIt\u2019s not characteristic of Brazilians.\u201dBrazilians are distrustful of more than just politicians. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolsonaro has sowed skepticism and at times outright hostility toward the press. He has dismissed critical stories \u2014 including investigations into his real estate holdings and a messy divorce \u2014 as \u201cfake news.\u201d That approach has resonated with many Brazilians who see large news organizations as beholden to the elite.Karine Neder, 45, an interior designer from Belo Horizonte, the capital of Minas Gerais state, said she started leaning toward Mr. Bolsonaro as media coverage of him became increasingly negative in recent months. She became a fervent admirer as Mr. Bolsonaro vowed to take drastic measures to restore security, like tougher prison sentences.\u201cWe live in a country where you can\u2019t watch the national news at night without being afraid of going to work the next day,\u201d she said after attending a rally for the candidate in Rio de Janeiro.While rivals enjoyed considerably more free airtime on television \u2014 which is allocated according to a political party\u2019s size \u2014 and spent heavily on polished ads, Mr. Bolsonaro proved very adept at using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube to reach voters.\u201cHe had the time and this new, unfettered space to occupy the collective imagination,\u201d Mr. Machado, the professor of political marketing, said.Bolsonaro fans created hundreds of group chats on the messaging app WhatsApp, which has become a prodigious channel to spread misinformation during elections in Latin America.Mr. Bolsonaro is considered a conservative for his hard-line approach to security, his staunch opposition to abortion rights and his disdain for the type of affirmative action initiatives the Workers\u2019 Party created to chip away at Brazil\u2019s steep inequality.But how he would manage the economy \u2014 the world\u2019s eighth largest \u2014 remains unclear.Mr. Bolsonaro and his surrogates have offered few detailed policy prescriptions and have backed contradictory positions on central issues, such as whether large state enterprises should be privatized.The policy blueprint on his campaign website is heavy on exclamation marks and short on details. \u201cOur strategy will be to adopt the same actions that work in countries that are booming, with jobs, low inflation, wages for workers and opportunity for all,\u201d his policy document proclaims.Mr. Bolsonaro has reacted with exasperation when interviewers have pressed him for details on how he would handle the economy, which is only now emerging from the recession.\u201cI\u2019m an artillery captain,\u201d he barked during a recent televised interview on the Globo News network. \u201cWhy would I talk about the economy?\u201dMany experts see him as ill equipped to tackle complex challenges that will ultimately need to be addressed, including pension and tax reform.\u201cThe military, when they took power in \u201864, and established a dictatorship, had a plan,\u201d said Helo\u00edsa Starling, a historian at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. \u201cWe may have disagreed with it, but they had a plan. He doesn\u2019t have a plan for the country.\u201dBut that has not fazed investors. They appear to have faith that Paulo Guedes, a University of Chicago-educated economist whom Mr. Bolsonaro has said he would appoint as finance minister, would push market-friendly reforms and rein in the social spending that mushroomed under the Workers\u2019 Party. As Mr. Bolsonaro has surged in the polls, markets have rallied, with stocks and the real currency rebounding.As a Bolsonaro victory has appeared increasingly likely, ardent opponents have rallied online and in the streets under the motto #EleN\u00e3o, or Not Him. But the demonstrations have not dented his support, which has left many of those who ardently oppose him feeling despondent.\u201cWe used to think that rights that have been conquered were rights that had been consolidated,\u201d said Ms. Schwarcz, the historian. \u201cI\u2019ve concluded that we were being foolish. We must continue fighting for them.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "50 Years After a Student Massacre, Mexico Reflects on Democracy", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico\u2019s student movement erupted so suddenly in the summer of 1968 that it seemed to catch even its followers by surprise.The protests began as Mexico City was preparing to host the Olympics that October \u2014 an event intended to showcase a modern nation with a growing middle class at the forefront of emerging economies.By taking to the streets just months before the inauguration of the games, students cracked that veneer, revealing a generation\u2019s latent anger against the country\u2019s repressive rule as the world looked on.Ten weeks after the first street protests, the government crushed the movement in a spasm of violence beyond anyone\u2019s worst fears. On Oct. 2, students who had gathered in a plaza for an evening meeting were picked off by government snipers perched on rooftops. Chaos broke out. The soldiers at the edge of the plaza, whose mission was to disperse the crowd, instead began to shoot into it.When the carnage ended, dozens lay dead and hundreds were shoved into vans, many of them to be tried and imprisoned. Twelve days later, President Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz opened the Olympic Games.The massacre at Tlatelolco, named for the vast housing development where the students were meeting, decimated the student movement 50 years ago. But for those who experienced it, those heady initial weeks marked the first time that a mass movement confronted the authoritarian control exerted by Mexico\u2019s one-party state.Tlatelolco shattered the bargain that the government imposed on Mexicans: political acquiescence in exchange for stability. It also gave rise to a wave of activists determined to seek new paths of resistance: a few took up arms in guerrilla movements and many more turned to social organizing, fanning out to impoverished city neighborhoods and forgotten mountain villages.\u201cMexico\u2019s political stability was broken and 100, 200, different political youth movements arose which spread out across the country,\u201d said Gilberto Guevara Niebla, one of the movement\u2019s leaders and chroniclers. \u201cMexico never returned to being the same Mexico.\u201dThe students\u2019 manifesto encompassed basic liberties and rights: free speech, a halt to state violence, accountability for police and military abuses, the release of political prisoners and the beginning of a dialogue with the government.The movement\u2019s explosive power lay precisely in the nature of its demands, said Sergio Aguayo, a professor at the Colegio de M\u00e9xico who participated in the movement and has written extensively about the massacre.\u201cIt was an agenda that could be adopted by all the sectors of Mexican society: left, center, right,\u201d Mr. Aguayo said.Fifty years later, the city is reliving those weeks with exhibits, lectures and marches spread across the same streets and campuses where soldiers battled students. Many people cite 1968 as a starting point for Mexico\u2019s long transition to democracy.That tidy narrative is almost certainly too simple an interpretation. Mexican democracy, still a work in progress, has evolved in the churn of internal and external pressures.Even before 1968, there were convulsions among miners and railroad workers, students and teachers. A rural guerrilla movement was forming in the western mountains. But the attack at Tlatelolco was a powerful symbol. The surge of political and social engagement that followed, and the demand for responsive government, has endured.Participants \u201cstarted to create the institutions that gradually weakened the foundations of authoritarianism,\u201d Mr. Aguayo said. \u201cWhat united us was the desire to change the regime peacefully in different ways.\u201dSeven decades of single-party rule by the Institutional Revolutionary Party ended in 2000, with the election of a conservative opposition president. And in July, voters swept out Mexico\u2019s political establishment and handed a landslide presidential victory to Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who has promised an administration dedicated to overcoming Mexico\u2019s deep inequalities.One thing has not changed: The Tlatelolco massacre remains unpunished. To many Mexicans, impunity for that crime echoes the state\u2019s failure to bring justice to countless other victims of murder and disappearance.\u201cTlatelolco became a symbol of the collective desire to obtain justice,\u201d said Mr. Aguayo.In the most acute expression of that impunity, the murder and disappearance of tens of thousands of Mexicans since the government declared war on organized crime in 2006 are unsolved.\u201cIt is very easy to produce cadavers in Mexico,\u201d said Elena Poniatowska, a journalist and writer whose 1971 book, \u201cThe Night of Tlatelolco,\u201d compiled witness accounts of the massacre. \u201cIt is very easy to die here.\u201dIn the summer of 1968, during the first days of the movement, there was little thought of risk, participants said. It was a time of social ferment. Mexico\u2019s students watched Paris roiling, the American civil rights movement taking hold and the opposition to the Vietnam War explode into demonstrations. They too felt that change was possible and reveled in a new sexual and cultural freedom that challenged Mexico\u2019s strict hierarchies.The upheaval began on July 23, when the police cracked down on a fight between students. Three days later, two marches set off days of street battles that ended when the army used a bazooka to break down the 18th-century door of the high school where students had taken refuge.Within a week, the government\u2019s harsh response unleashed a suppressed desire for political change. The rector of the Autonomous National University of Mexico, Javier Barros Sierra, supported the movement, marching with the students on August 1. Students organized themselves into a National Strike Council, published a list of six demands and backed them up with marches throughout August.The students never threatened to overthrow the government. Still, an exhilarating sense of possibility filled the young protesters.Sergio Zerme\u00f1o, a sociology student at the national university, was part of a group that took over the university printing press to roll out the movement\u2019s newspaper and then sell copies to raise money.\u201cYou go from being a nobody, a student like me, to being someone who in 15 days had economic power,\u201d and the freedom to speak publicly through a newspaper, recalled Mr. Zerme\u00f1o, who has written about the movement.Students went to public spaces, markets and factories to collect donations and spread their message.\u201cWhen they say that the people did not support us, that is a lie,\u201d said Ana Ignacia Rodr\u00edguez M\u00e1rquez, who was a law student at the national university.The movement grew through August, culminating in an enormous student march to Mexico City\u2019s central square, the Z\u00f3calo. The government saw it as a metastasizing threat.In his annual state of the nation speech on Sept. 1, Mr. D\u00edaz Ordaz, a close ally of Washington at the height of the Cold War, assailed the movement.Everything has a limit, the president said, adding, \u201cAnd we can no longer allow the legal order to be irrevocably broken.\u2019\u2019Mr. D\u00edaz Ordaz then issued an ultimatum, saying that he would use the \u201ctotality of the permanent armed forces\u201d to restore order.On Sept. 18, the army occupied the university campus. Five days later, soldiers retook the National Polytechnic Institute.But it was not enough to contain the students. With the Olympics imminent and foreign reporters arriving to cover the games, the government had decided to end the demonstrations and control the image foreigners would get of Mexico.The government knew the dissidents were meeting on Oct. 2 in the Plaza of Three Cultures at the Tlatelolco housing development. The officers prepared to arrest the student leaders, who were speaking from the windows of a third-floor apartment.Mr. Guevara Niebla, one of the organizers, was among them. About an hour into the meeting, he heard a roar as the first shots were fired into the crowd from snipers.\u201cIt was a cry, a collective voice, a terrible thing, but of fear,\u201d he said.Then soldiers with their bayonets drawn advanced from the avenue bordering the plaza.That was followed by the thunder of many weapons being fired simultaneously, he said. Peeking out a window, he could see soldiers shooting into the crowd from windows on either side of him. Two or three hours later, soldiers burst in to arrest him.What exactly happened at Tlatelolco remained a mystery for many years. The government blamed the shootout on anti-national and foreign agents.Even the number of dead is uncertain. Official estimates initially claimed that seven people had been killed. Eventually a consensus was reached that as many as 300 people had died, based on reporting by foreign correspondents.What was clear after the violence of that night was that Mexico\u2019s government was willing to go to extreme lengths to maintain control.Mr. Guevara Niebla\u2019s arrest was followed by torture and 31 months in prison. It still haunts him. \u201cI have fought to survive and overcome my own traumas,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cMy only way to survive is to acquire more clarity about what I have lived through.\u2019\u2019Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sears\u2019s Edward Lampert Was a Wizard. Now He\u2019s Coming to Terms With Failure.", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseBy age 25, Edward S. Lampert was already a Wall Street wunderkind, celebrated for his intellect, ambition and prodigious work ethic. The famed investor Richard Rainwater, the billionaire Hollywood mogul David Geffen, and Michael Dell and Thomas J. Tisch were among the prominent backers who gave him more than $200 million in start-up capital.If that was his intent, it was a singularly inept effort. Mr. Lampert\u2019s steadfast \u2014 many would say stubborn \u2014 commitment to Sears has cost him billions in personal wealth, not to mention the damage to his reputation. Nearly all of his early investors have abandoned him. His hedge fund\u2019s assets have dwindled. Last year, one of his staunchest backers, the hedge fund manager Bruce Berkowitz, bailed out, saying that Sears had \u201cwrecked\u201d his hedge fund\u2019s returns. The decline of Sears \u201chas been hugely frustrating and fatiguing for me to watch,\u201d Mr. Berkowitz told his investors.\u201cI\u2019ve taken a huge personal hit,\u201d Mr. Lampert told me this week in a wide-ranging interview, his first since the bankruptcy filing. \u201cNot just in money, but time. There\u2019s been an enormous opportunity cost.\u201dThere was widespread skepticism when Mr. Lampert first merged two once-popular but struggling retailers in 2005. On one flank was the mighty Walmart. On the other was the fast-growing Amazon. Sears lacked Walmart\u2019s economies of scale and Amazon\u2019s digital reach. But Mr. Lampert knew that great fortunes aren\u2019t made by following conventional wisdom.\u201cBeing a contrarian, being an independent thinker has never bothered me,\u201d Mr. Lampert said. \u201cI knew it was going to be hard no matter what. But I was trying to be opportunistic. I was willing to make a very big bet in money and time.\u201d He pointed out that Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, is now the richest person in the world, and Sam Walton, the Walmart patriarch, was the richest American in his day. \u201cThey both took advantage of an opportunity.\u201dThe opportunity that Mr. Lampert, but few others, saw was the combination of Sears\u2019s brands and customer loyalty and Kmart\u2019s attractive real estate, most of it in prime stand-alone locations rather than within aging malls. That promise seemed to be borne out in the early years. But the financial crisis and the collapse of the housing market hit Sears\u2019s appliance and housewares sales. Sears never regained momentum.By 2009, Mr. Lampert told me, he realized that nothing less than a radical transformation of Sears\u2019s culture would allow it to keep up with the digital revolution that was transforming the retail industry. That year, he launched the store\u2019s ShopYourWay campaign as the cornerstone of a new data-driven and customer-focused strategy to compete with Amazon.That\u2019s where Mr. Lampert met his match. He said he didn\u2019t pick the best executives to fully embrace the company\u2019s digital makeover. \u201cI underestimated how difficult it is to do and how critical are the right people to lead and to get people to buy in,\u201d he said.As one example, he cited his attempt to convert underutilized space into internet lounges, which offered customers free Wi-Fi and a place to relax. It was an attempt to get customers, many of whom didn\u2019t have internet access at home at the time, into stores, much as Starbucks had attracted laptop-toting coffee drinkers.This was anathema to traditional retailers, who measured success strictly in terms of sales per square foot and for whom any space not dedicated to merchandise was a waste. Nonetheless, the computer-equipped internet lounges were rolled out in 100 Sears locations \u2014 but in a halfhearted manner. \u201cI\u2019d visit a store, and there\u2019d be 10 computers,\u201d Mr. Lampert recalled. \u201cHalf of them wouldn\u2019t work.\u201d The lounges were abandoned. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have store leaders or a C.E.O. at the time who embraced the idea,\u201d Mr. Lampert said.In 2013 Mr. Lampert himself became chief executive, something he said he had never aspired to. He expected to stay in the role only a few months. \u201cI wanted to be an idea generator,\u201d he said. \u201cI was trying to be a catalyst, not the operating person.\u201dBy then it was too late. Caught in a spiral of declining sales, huge losses, store closings, forced asset sales and relentless competition from online rivals, Sears struggled for its day-to-day existence, a war of attrition that ended with this week\u2019s bankruptcy.It\u2019s far from clear that successful internet lounges, or even an agile culture that embraced change, would have saved Sears. Mr. Lampert has reaped criticism for underinvesting in Sears\u2019s physical stores; for trying to run the company from his Florida office, far from the company\u2019s Hoffman Estates, Ill., headquarters; and for a revolving door in the executive suites. In the end, though, none of that may have mattered much, either.\u201cI had a vision and a passion, but I never thought of myself as the only person who could save it,\u201d he said. \u201cI may have been the only person who tried to save it.\u201d He noted that no one ever approached him about buying Sears, even at a bargain price. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t lost on me that other people didn\u2019t think it was possible.\u201dMr. Lampert insisted to me that ShopYourWay was showing promise but required far more time and capital than Sears could muster. \u201cIf I could have raised billions, I could have done things differently,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ability to incubate ideas requires a huge investment.\u201dMr. Lampert added: \u201cI\u2019m not fine with the outcome, but I\u2019m fine with the effort. I\u2019ve never worked harder or stretched further beyond my limits.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Flavor Is a Language, and Like Wine, Candy Has Its Own", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "I learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dNations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines.

Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team.

But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail.

It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day.

Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times.

At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Budget Deficit Jumps Nearly 17% in 2018", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The federal budget deficit swelled to $779 billion in fiscal year 2018, the Treasury Department said on Monday, driven in large part by a sharp decline in corporate tax revenues after the Trump tax cuts took effect.The deficit rose nearly 17 percent year over year, from $666 billion in 2017. It is now on pace to top $1 trillion a year before the next presidential election, according to forecasts from the Trump administration and outside analysts. The deficit for the 2018 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, was the largest since 2012, when the economy and federal revenues were still recovering from the depths of the recession.Administration officials attributed the deficit\u2019s rise to greater federal spending, including the military and domestic budget increases that President Trump approved this year, not the $1.5 trillion tax cut.\u201cPresident Trump prioritized making a significant investment in America\u2019s military after years of reductions in military spending undermined our preparedness and national security,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. \u201cGoing forward, the president\u2019s economic policies that have stimulated strong economic growth, combined with proposals to cut wasteful spending, will lead America toward a sustainable financial path.\u201dBut the numbers released by Mr. Mnuchin\u2019s department suggest falling revenues were a far larger contributor to the rising deficit than higher spending. Federal outlays increased for the fiscal year, but, because the economy grew at a faster pace than outlays did the previous year, they fell as a share of the economy, to 20.3 percent from 20.7 percent.Federal revenues rose by 0.4 percent from fiscal year 2017. That was a slowdown from previous years. Revenues rose by 1.5 percent between fiscal years 2016 and 2017. They rose by 0.5 percent between 2015 and 2016, when economic growth was considerably slower than it has been over the last year. Between 2014 and 2015, they rose by 7.5 percent.As a share of the economy, revenues fell to 16.5 percent in fiscal year 2018, from 17.2 percent the year before. Revenues are now nearly a percentage point lower than their average for the last 40 years, the Treasury Department said in its news release.For the full 2018 fiscal year, corporate tax receipts were nearly $205 billion. That figure is a drop from $297 billion in fiscal year 2017.The 2018 numbers do not reflect a full year of effects from the Trump tax cuts, which also included cuts for individuals and owners of so-called pass-through corporations. Most of the new law\u2019s provisions took effect in January.Many Republicans, including Mr. Mnuchin, said during last year\u2019s debate over tax policy that the proposed cuts would pay for themselves by producing faster economic growth and correspondingly higher federal revenues. Outside analysts disagreed. The Joint Committee on Taxation, the official tax scorekeeper of Congress, projected that the law would reduce revenues by $1 trillion, even when accounting for additional growth.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "U.S. Imposes Sanctions on Turkish Company for Trade With North Korea", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The United States imposed sanctions on Thursday against a Turkish company and two of its officers for doing business with North Korea, sending a tough signal to Pyongyang ahead of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s expected visit there this weekend.The Treasury Department accused S.I.A. Falcon International Group of being involved in trading weapons and luxury goods with North Korea, defying sanctions imposed by both the United States and the United Nations.\u201cThe international community must not stand idly by as U.N. sanctions are being circumvented,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a press statement.The United States placed individual sanctions on Huseyin Sahin, S.I.A.\u2019s chief executive, and Erhan Culha, its general manager. Also sanctioned was Ri Song Un, a North Korean diplomat serving in Mongolia who was hosted by S.I.A. in Turkey to negotiate the deals, according to the United States.Thursday\u2019s sanctions were intended to send two messages: that the Trump administration will continue to ratchet up economic pressure on Pyongyang until North Korea ends its nuclear and ballistic missile weapons programs, and that the relationship between the United States and Turkey continues to be troubled.The Trump administration has issued hundreds of similar sanctions this year and is expected to put in place hundreds more. It is unusual for the United States to impose such economic penalties on citizens and companies in allied countries, such as Turkey, which is a NATO member. Even so, the Trump administration has deployed sanctions as one of its most important tools of foreign policy.Pyongyang has insisted that the United States agree to an end-of-war declaration as a condition for nuclear negotiations to continue. The Trump administration wants North Korea to provide a detailed description of its nuclear and ballistic missile storage and production sites as the first step in a process of unwinding those programs.South Korea has largely sided with the North Koreans, saying an end-of-war declaration is needed. And Russian and Chinese diplomats said last week that Pyongyang should receive some relief from sanctions to reward North Korea for the progress made so far in talks.American and Turkish diplomats have been negotiating ever since in hopes of resolving a host of differences.Sanctions make it difficult for people and companies to find banks or other financial organizations willing to offer services, since so many of the world\u2019s banks have operations or connections to the United States. American law requires that banks with ties to the United States avoid those under sanction.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "U.C.F. Is the Best College Football Team in Florida. So, Where\u2019s the Respect?", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 Josh Heupel, the head football coach at the University of Central Florida, was on a recruiting trip several months ago when his wife called and asked when his next flight was.There was no flight. He was simply driving to Jacksonville, a couple of hours from Central Florida\u2019s Orlando campus.\u201cLast year during recruiting, I got on maybe four flights total,\u201d said Heupel, who put in years as a recruiting road warrior when he was an assistant at Oklahoma and Missouri.Still, undefeated U.C.F. is probably the fourth- or fifth-best-known team in the state, a directional university celebrating its 50th anniversary, whose football program has played in college sports\u2019 top tier for barely two decades. Its league, the American Athletic Conference, distributes to its members a small fraction of the windfall from media deals compared with what the biggest conferences deliver to their schools.Three years ago, U.C.F. went 0-12. Yet the No. 10 Knights are, for a second year in a row, the best team in the state and one of the best anywhere else. In the last five years, they have won two New Year\u2019s Day bowl games. They hold the longest active winning streak in the Football Bowl Subdivision, at 19 games.This year the offense is ranked third in Division I in yards and seventh in points per game. It is worth noting that a game at North Carolina was called off after Hurricane Florence, and the Knights have trounced mostly weak competition (including one Power 5 team, Pitt) and barely survived Memphis last weekend.\u201cI often say that reputation lags reality,\u201d said Dale Whittaker, the U.C.F. president. He was referring to the university as a whole, but it might apply to the football team especially.Originally Florida Technological University, and founded several miles east of downtown Orlando in connection with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \u2014 Cape Canaveral is less than an hour\u2019s drive to the east \u2014 U.C.F. has grown into one of the country\u2019s largest universities, with 68,000 students. Whittaker compares U.C.F. to Ohio State and Arizona State as a giant, urban university well suited to the 21st century\u2019s information economy.As for football, \u201cOur competitive advantages are very real,\u201d said Danny White, the university\u2019s athletic director.\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to be here?\u201d said Richie Grant, a defensive back from Fort Walton Beach, Fla. \u201cLike, it\u2019s supposed to be fall, winter, something like that? And it\u2019s, what, 90 degrees out here?\u201dFlorida being Florida, there will always be a surplus of talent.\u201cThey may not be big enough for Florida or Miami to go after them, but they\u2019re still going to be fast or strong,\u201d said Luke Stampini, a recruiting analyst for 247Sports who is based in Delray Beach, Fla.These athletes, then \u2014 rawly gifted, but not as purely talented as those who end up at the in-state blue bloods \u2014 may need specific schemes built around them, but White conceived the potential for a \u201cmoneyball\u201d-esque strategy as he watched Baylor and Texas Christian routinely defeat Texas and Texas A&M during the past decade with innovative game plans.When he arrived in late 2015, White sought a coach who would install a quick tempo to complement the athletes\u2019 physical speed. He got Scott Frost, who had been an assistant at Oregon under Chip Kelly, known for his creativity and fast pace.At Oregon, Frost had tutored Marcus Mariota, who won the Heisman Trophy after his final year with the Ducks and went on to become the Tennessee Titans\u2019 starting quarterback. Mariota is revered in his native state, Hawaii, and so McKenzie Milton, a talented Class of 2016 quarterback from Mililani High School in Hawaii, was receptive to Frost\u2019s entreaties. But Oregon never offered Milton a scholarship.\u201cHe\u2019s small,\u201d Stampini said of Milton. \u201cIf he was 6-2, the whole Pac-12 would have been after him.\u201dWhen Frost took the U.C.F. job, Milton flipped his commitment from Hawaii. Last season, he threw for more than 4,000 yards, with 37 touchdowns against nine interceptions, adding 613 yards and eight touchdowns on the ground.Heupel hired Randy Shannon, a former player and longtime assistant at Miami and then Florida with vital in-state ties, as his defensive coordinator. He got recruits on the phone the night of their first news conference, Heupel said.With 68,000 students, the university is set to collect roughly $25 million in fees this year.U.C.F.\u2019s two final games in the regular season are against No. 20 Cincinnati and then down Interstate 4 at South Florida, currently ranked 21st. Win out, and U.C.F. will get a conference championship game against strong competition, but will it be strong enough to impress the playoff committee?Snubbing U.C.F. last year, the playoff committee argued that \u201cthey had not been as challenged with their nonconference schedule, and their schedule over all, as teams right above them and right below them,\u201d in the words of Kirby Hocutt, the committee chairman, who is Texas Tech\u2019s athletic director.White felt that was disrespectful not only to U.C.F. but to its league, which counted two other teams in the final A.P. rankings. This past weekend, undefeated Notre Dame moved up a spot in the A.P. poll, to No. 4, after barely beating Pitt \u2014 the same squad U.C.F. torched by 31 points a few weeks before. A.A.C. teams, from top to bottom, are 7-8 versus Power 5 teams this year.Two years ago, U.C.F. was one of several finalists for spots in the Big 12 before that conference elected not to expand. The next expansion era most likely will not occur until the middle of the next decade, when several broadcast deals are set to expire. The A.A.C. is preparing to negotiate a new deal now. Its agreement with ESPN expires in 2020.White said the A.A.C. merits inclusion in a \u201cPower 6\u201d setup for the F.B.S. For now, though, the Knights must win all their games and hope a payoff will come.\u201cPeople are going to look at this conference, look who we played, crossover games, look at scores,\u201d Heupel said, \u201cand I think we\u2019ll be where we want to be.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Turkish Officials Say Khashoggi Was Killed on Order of Saudi Leadership", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byANKARA, Turkey \u2014 Top Turkish security officials have concluded that the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi was assassinated in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on orders from the highest levels of the royal court, a senior official said Tuesday.\u201cIt is like \u2018Pulp Fiction,\u2019\u201d the official said.Saudi officials, including Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, have denied the allegations, insisting that Mr. Khashoggi left the consulate freely shortly after he arrived. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has demanded that the Saudis provide evidence proving their claim.It remains unclear how the Turkish government determined that Mr. Khashoggi had been killed, but the conclusion that the Saudi royal court ordered it could increase the pressure on both sides of the dispute. It would make it more difficult for the two governments to come up with a face-saving story blaming Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance on some third party, on rogue elements of the Saudi security forces, or on an accident during an interrogation that went wrong.Turkish officials have left things murky enough \u2014 speaking on condition of anonymity and refusing to publicly disclose their evidence \u2014 that such possibilities cannot be ruled out. Some pro-government news outlets have reported that the police were still investigating the possibility that Mr. Khashoggi was abducted, not killed.But as more than a week has passed since he was last seen, the possibility that he is alive has dwindled.The security establishment concluded that Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing was directed from the top because only the most senior Saudi leaders could order an operation of such scale and complexity, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose confidential briefings.Fifteen Saudi agents had arrived on two charter flights last Tuesday, the day Mr. Khashoggi disappeared, the official said.All 15 left just a few hours later, and Turkey has now identified the roles that most or all of them held in the Saudi government or security services, the official said. One was an autopsy expert, presumably there to help dismember the body, the official said.Mr. Erdogan was informed of the conclusions on Saturday, according to several people with knowledge of the briefings, and he has since dispatched officials to anonymously tell myriad news outlets, including The New York Times, that Mr. Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi Consulate.But Mr. Erdogan himself has not publicly accused Saudi Arabia of killing Mr. Khashoggi. Nor has the Turkish president disclosed specific evidence to back up that allegation.His reticence has raised questions about whether Turkey might ultimately back away from an explicit accusation in the interest of preserving relations with Saudi Arabia, a wealthy regional heavyweight. Mr. Erdogan may prefer not to alienate the kingdom as he struggles to manage a troubled economy and a many-sided power struggle over the outcome of the civil war in neighboring Syria.The official who spoke about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing said that report and other similar ones were incorrect and were probably the result of the limited information shared among different agencies within the Turkish government.The need to protect intelligence sources \u2014 which might include intercepted communications or human informers \u2014 also contributed to the government\u2019s reluctance to reveal its evidence, the official said. That need for secrecy could also hamper any efforts to prosecute any Saudi agents involved.Another person briefed on the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose confidential details, told The Times on Saturday that Turkish intelligence had obtained a video of the killing, made by the Saudis to prove that it had occurred.A commentator close to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government said so publicly on Tuesday.\u201cThere is a video of the moment of him being killed,\u201d Kemal Ozturk, a columnist in a pro-government newspaper and the former head of a semiofficial news agency, said in an interview on a pro-government television network, citing unnamed security officials.Saudi Arabia continued to disclaim any knowledge of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fate and even to express concern for his safety. Both governments said Tuesday that Saudi Arabia had allowed the Turkish police to search the Istanbul consulate, a deviation from normal diplomatic agreements.Another senior Turkish official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic strategy, said Ankara hoped that Washington and the international community would take the lead in challenging Saudi Arabia over the fate of Mr. Khashoggi, a legal resident of the United States and a columnist for The Washington Post.The Trump administration had been largely silent on the matter until Monday, when President Trump said he was \u201cconcerned\u201d about it in response to a question from a reporter.The administration may have been hesitant to enter the feud in part because Saudi Arabia is a close American ally. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his enthusiasm for the kingdom\u2019s dominant leader, the 33-year-old crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.But with Mr. Khashoggi unseen for days, there were signs on Tuesday that the pressure was increasing. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on the Saudi government \u201cto support a thorough investigation of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance and to be transparent about the results of that investigation.\u201dThe United Nations human rights office also called for Saudi Arabia and Turkey to conduct a thorough investigation and to make the results public.Turkish investigators are looking into the case of Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist who entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and vanished.\u201cThis is of serious concern, the apparent enforced disappearance of Mr. Khashoggi from the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul,\u201d Ravina Shamdasani, a spokeswoman for the human rights office, told reporters in Geneva.Two other Turkish government officials confirmed the broad outlines of a report in Sabah detailing the movements of the Saudi team that arrived in Istanbul on the day of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly.The newspaper said that two private Gulfstream IV planes belonging to a charter service that has often worked with the Saudi government, Sky Prime Aviation, took off from Riyadh on the morning of Oct. 2 carrying 15 passengers \u2014 all intelligence agents or government officials.One plane landed at Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk Airport at 3:13 a.m. that day with nine passengers on board. They checked into two hotels near the consulate and booked rooms for three nights. But they collected their belongings later that day and took off in the same jet at 10:46 p.m., stopping in Dubai on the way back to Riyadh.A second plane landed in Istanbul at 5:15 p.m. that day with six passengers. All went directly to the consulate and quickly returned to the airport; their plane took off barely an hour after it had arrived, at 6:20 p.m., the newspaper reported, stopping in Cairo as it returned to Riyadh.Security camera footage showed Mr. Khashoggi entering the consulate shortly after 1 p.m. that day. Ms. Cengiz, his fianc\u00e9e, waited outside, and she has said he never emerged.Two and a half hours after he entered the facility, six vehicles with diplomatic license plates pulled out, carrying 15 Saudi officials and intelligence officers, Sabah reported.Two other vehicles, including a black Mercedes Vito van with darkened windows, went from the consulate to the consul\u2019s residence about 200 yards away. Turkish employees of the residence had unexpectedly been told not to report for work that day, the newspaper said.Sabah reported, without naming its sources, that police investigators suspected that Mr. Khashoggi was in the van.Friends of Mr. Khashoggi had planned to hold a funeral prayer for him on Tuesday, which had been expected to turn into a demonstration against Saudi Arabia. But his friends canceled those plans, and they could not be reached to explain their decision.David D. Kirkpatrick reported from Ankara, and Carlotta Gall from Istanbul.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Coming Storm Over the Supreme Court", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIf it swings too far to the right, expect a response.Mr. Friedman is a professor at New York University Law School.Filling those new vacancies would give him a clear majority on the court, presumably ensuring his future legislative proposals would be upheld. Roosevelt\u2019s \u201ccourt-packing\u201d plan cast the country into six months of furious debate over the propriety of such a move. In the end the plan evaporated, but not before the court capitulated. Roosevelt\u2019s proposal set off a genuine constitutional crisis, with little else on the national agenda getting any attention.Why should we care about what happened some 80 years ago?Because with the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh, an extremely conservative majority now is fully in control of the court, which, at some point in the future \u2014 perhaps five or 10 years from now \u2014 could lead to another crisis much like the one in 1937.Anyone watching the deeply troubled, and troubling, confirmation process for Justice Kavanaugh surely understands the depth of anger on the left, which is unlikely to dissipate anytime soon. If the country moves left in the next few years, as the court moves right, we have the makings for a serious collision.You may be waiting impatiently to point out that Roosevelt\u2019s plan to pack the court ultimately failed. In the heat of the battle, Roosevelt\u2019s key ally, the Senate majority leader, Joe Robinson, dropped dead, and at that point, Congress and country apparently had enough of the struggle and Roosevelt dropped it.Of course, the justices have learned this lesson over time, and so we have since avoided any really serious crises involving the court. Chief Justice John Roberts clearly understands the political implications of a court out of step with the populace. Though his views are profoundly conservative, the chief justice nonetheless has done an admirable job of moderating the impact of his colleagues on the right, even voting \u201cleft\u201d himself at critical moments, as he did to uphold President Obama\u2019s health care plan and to limit law enforcement searches of cellphone records. Still, it\u2019s hard to know if he can continue to pull this off as the court drifts ever farther right \u2014 just as it is hard to see him denying conservatives the votes to overturn Roe v. Wade.The more the justices are perceived as partisan and ideological, the more the public will treat them in precisely that way. Which includes bringing them to heel when they get seriously out of line.Advertisement"}

Sears has lost $11 billion since 2011; sales have dropped 60 percent over the same period; and it has closed hundreds of stores. Its C.E.O., Eddie Lampert, has sold off businesses to raise cash, but critics argue that he has strip-mined the company.Filing for bankruptcy is risky for retailers, as doing so tends to send customers and suppliers fleeing, making it hard to recover.

One extreme action it could take, as the holder of over $1 trillion in U.S. foreign debt, would be to buy back that debt \u2014 or even to dump it on the open market. Experts tend to dismiss that possibility, as it would severely damage both the American and Chinese economies.There is no proving ground. There is no predictable math, no scale model. If China were to use its nuclear option and the markets didn\u2019t react, it would lose influence in stark fashion. If it worked \u2014 but was more effective than expected \u2014 China could inflict unintended damage on its own economy. And even a perfectly executed strike that left China unharmed would be perilous: A targeted attack on the United States economy would have unknowable repercussions. If the fallout cloud settled over Europe or emerging markets, would China be ready for that fight, too?Beijing\u2019s latest effort to prop up its economy amid a trade war with the U.S. isn\u2019t working yet. China\u2019s currency, the renminbi, fell again this week, to below 6.93 per dollar.But the currency doesn\u2019t trade freely: It moves within a range set by the central bank. And a fall in its value can make Chinese exports cheaper for foreign buyers, which is handy when President Trump\u2019s tariffs push up their prices in America.Among the sectors hardest hit by Mr. Trump\u2019s approach are the beverage and auto industries, which rely heavily on foreign aluminum and steel to make cans and cars. PepsiCo, the drinks and snacks company, said this month that higher prices for aluminum imports from Canada were eating into quarterly profits and said it would raise prices as a result. The company lowered its profit forecast for the year and its stock slid. Similarly, the chief executive of Ford Motor Company said last month that the additional costs from the metal tariffs alone would shave about $1 billion off its annual profits.The new trade deal won\u2019t be signed until late November, and it could be amended before then. Some Republican lawmakers have been pushing Mr. Trump to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs. That may happen \u2014 or the whole thing could be thrown into limbo if Democrats take back the House.The uncertainty in insider trading law invites debate over the legality of misconduct that has no place in our markets. But this is a fixable problem: The law can be updated and made clearer. Ideally, Congress would take the lead. But bipartisan proposals to update the law have languished for years.

Rowe Price in Baltimore. \u201cI think there\u2019s a level of anxiety about the market, especially given how far we\u2019ve come.\u201dEarly Friday, markets in Asia suggested the damage could be moderating, as Chinese shares matched Wall Street\u2019s drop but stocks in Japan, Hong Kong and elsewhere in the region were largely flat.Investors who have ridden the nearly decade-long bull market in stocks are now contending with a growing crop of concerns, including rising borrowing costs that could dampen economic growth and growing tensions between the United States and China. Worries about rising interest rates eased briefly early in the day after a report showing muted inflation helped send yields on government bonds lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ended the day just below 3.15 percent, lower than it had been in several days.Though the S.&P. has fallen from its most recent peaks in January and September, it is still up more than 20 percent since President Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017.+30%Percentage changein the S.&P. 500-stock index \u2026+25+20\u2026 Since Trump\u2019sinauguration:+20.5%+15+10+5\u2026 Since the market\u2019s previouspeak on Jan. 26: \u20135.0%0Inauguration\u20135Correctionterritory\u201310\u2026 Since themarket\u2019s peakon Sept. 20: \u20136.9%\u20131520172018+30%+25Percentage change in theS.&P. 500-stock index \u2026+20\u2026 Since Trump\u2019sinauguration:+20.5%+15+10+5\u2026 Since the market\u2019s previouspeak on Jan. 26: \u20135.0%0Inauguration\u20135Correction territory\u2026 Since themarket\u2019s peakon Sept. 20: \u20136.9%\u201310\u20131520172018Source: Refinitiv | By The New York TimesChristine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned on Thursday that if the tensions between the United States and China continued to escalate, \u201cthe global economy would take a significant hit.\u201d\u201cOur strong recommendation,\u201d Ms. Lagarde said at a meeting in Bali, Indonesia, \u201cis to de-escalate those tensions and to work toward a global trade system that is stronger, that is fairer, and that is fit for purpose and fit for the future.\u201dReflecting concerns about the global economy, commodity prices also tumbled on Thursday, with the decline in oil prices, for example, weighing on shares of energy producers.Earlier in the day, stocks were hit particularly hard in Asia, where no market was spared in the sweeping sell-off. Stocks in Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul, South Korea, dropped 4 percent or more.Shares also fell in Europe on Thursday, though the declines were less extreme than in the United States or Asia. The region is also vulnerable to a long list of economic risks, including the possibility of a disorderly exit by Britain from the European Union and the potential for Italy to provoke a new eurozone debt crisis.Italy\u2019s populist government has drafted a spending plan that would defy European budget rules to fulfill election promises. The market interest rates on Italian bonds have spiked as investors worry that the country may not be able to service its debt, which is equivalent to more than 130 percent of annual economic output.While geopolitical issues have sprung to the fore, subtler shifts in the backdrop of the stock market might be producing outsize reactions. With the bulk of the earnings season about to start on Friday, many American companies have paused their share repurchase programs to comply with blackout periods, potentially worsening stock market swings.\u201cThat\u2019s another level of support that\u2019s sort of gone in this period,\u201d said Marina Severinovsky, an investment strategist at the asset manager Schroders.More broadly, investors are readjusting to the slow withdrawal of support from central banks \u2014 such as the Federal Reserve \u2014 which has acted as a tailwind for stocks since the market rally began in March 2009.The Fed says it will continue to lift interest rates in the face of robust economic growth, despite direct criticism of the policy from Mr. Trump in recent days.The Fed is also starting to significantly shrink its balance sheet, effectively withdrawing some of the money it pumped into the financial system during and after the financial crisis a decade ago.\u201cI think these are kind of the teething pains for asset markets as we kind of get away from super-easy money,\u201d said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Inside Colombia\u2019s Beloved Candy Factory", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "For millions of Latin Americans, the Colombina factory in La Paila is the place where sweet moments are made.Leer en enspa\u00f1olFor nearly 50 years, Bon Bon Bums have been produced in the Colombina factory in La Paila, north of Cali. At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco. Her debut novel, \u201cFruit of the Drunken Tree,\u201d was published this summer.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales.

The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go.

Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties.

The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making.

Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTrade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times.

{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Trade War May Create New Auto Jobs. In China.", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump has said he started a trade war to create jobs in America. But foreign carmakers that employ thousands of workers in the United States are gauging whether tariffs, the main weapon in that war, may compel them to shift jobs to, of all places, China.Carmakers\u2019 early hopes that congressional Republicans who favor free trade could restrain Mr. Trump have faded. Instead, manufacturers are girding for a protracted period of conflict that will disrupt supply chains and change the companies\u2019 calculations about where to expand and where to cut back.BMW, the largest exporter of cars from the United States, has already moved some production of its popular X3 sport utility vehicle \u2014 once made exclusively in Spartanburg, S.C. \u2014 to a factory in Shenyang, China. Analysts expect the German automaker to also move some production of its larger X5.By shifting production, BMW can avoid China\u2019s punitive tariffs on cars imported from the United States, which have ensnared foreign automakers with large American factories. It could also insulate BMW if Mr. Trump follows through on his threat to tax imported vehicles and parts, a move that would further increase the cost of building cars in the United States and selling them abroad.The Chinese government is encouraging expansion. It is allowing BMW to increase its stake in a Chinese joint venture to 75 percent from 50 percent, an unprecedented majority share for a foreign carmaker that makes BMW the first company to benefit from a policy meant to give the makers of passenger cars larger stakes in such joint ventures.Business leaders in South Carolina and other areas that depend on foreign carmakers are registering alarm. At the very least, they wonder if jobs to be created for future models will shift out of the United States. Their worst fear? Workers in places like Spartanburg could see jobs wither.\u201cIt\u2019s not just BMW,\u201d Mr. Britt said by telephone from Spartanburg. \u201cIt\u2019s every one of the suppliers that produce for BMW.\u201dThe effects of the trade war are already being felt in South Carolina.China is a big and profitable market for BMW. But retaliatory tariffs of 40 percent on imported cars have sharply raised the cost of X5s in China. The company was able to skirt some of the tariffs by meeting some of the demand in China with cars partly built in South Carolina and finished in Thailand.BMW is stepping up its investments in China. It has announced that it would spend $3.4 billion to expand its Shenyang operations and hire 5,000 workers over the next several years. The two factories it operates there could eventually surpass Spartanburg, BMW\u2019s largest factory in the world, in the number of cars produced.BMW representatives emphasize that the company has not decided to relocate production of the X5, one of its most profitable models, from Spartanburg. But Saskia Essbauer, a spokeswoman, said: \u201cProduction always follows the market. Naturally as a company we have an interest to produce where the demand is.\u201dOthers are following BMW\u2019s lead. ZF, a major German auto industry supplier, recently said that it would build a factory in China to produce transmissions used in the X5 and other BMW models.\u201cOur philosophy is we follow our customers and we serve our customers where they need us,\u201d said Christoph Horn, a ZF spokesman.Other foreign car companies will have to make similar assessments. Mercedes-Benz employs about 4,000 workers at a large factory in Alabama. The Swedish carmaker Volvo, which belongs to Zhejiang Geely Holdings of China, opened a plant in South Carolina in June. Volvo plans to hire 1,500 people in the state.Daimler, which exports Mercedes cars to China from a factory in Tuscaloosa, Ala., has warned that trade tensions were hurting its sales. In a call with reporters on Thursday, Bodo Uebber, the chief financial officer, said the company was reviewing ways to counter the effect of the tariffs, which have meant higher prices for clients and dealers.Mr. Uebber said that Daimler was \u201ccurrently delivering normally into China.\u201d Asked about possible changes in the production line, he said, \u201cWe are looking at other alternatives, but it is too early to say anything.\u201dStefan Elfstrom, a Volvo spokesman, did not dispute the comments attributed to Mr. Gustafsson, but he said the company\u2019s plans for South Carolina had not changed.Some of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade policies could lead to more auto industry jobs in the United States, but at a stiff price to consumers.Newly revised trade agreements with Mexico and Canada require carmakers to use more components made in the United States. Suppliers may expand American operations to comply, but they will be forced to pass the extra cost on to customers.Higher prices, at a time when interest rates on auto loans are also rising, could crimp demand and offset any job gains.\u201cThe average price of a vehicle in the United States is $35,000,\u201d said Ann Wilson, senior vice president of government affairs at the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, which represents suppliers. \u201cIf we increase the cost without increasing the value, are we going to be able to sell those vehicles? It\u2019s going to be a real challenge.\u201dFor automakers and suppliers, figuring out where and how much to invest has become devilishly difficult because no one knows what Mr. Trump is going to do. Many are delaying decisions as long as they can.\u201cA lot of my clients are in wait-and-see mode,\u201d said Mike Wall, director of automotive analysis at IHS Markit, a research firm. \u201cBefore they commit on a new facility or a new technology, they want to make sure they\u2019re not going be turned upside down because of tariffs.\u201dThe irony is that the turmoil is being felt most keenly in the Southeastern states where BMW and Mercedes as well as hundreds of suppliers are, hard-core Trump country.Mr. Britt, the Spartanburg County Council member, said he was a lifelong Republican who, like many Spartanburg residents, voted for Mr. Trump. But he has become a vocal opponent of the president\u2019s trade policies, and he questions how long Mr. Trump\u2019s support will hold.\u201cPeople vote with their pocketbooks,\u201d Mr. Britt said. \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting South Carolina would go Democrat, but when people start losing jobs, a lot can happen.\u201dAn earlier version of this article misidentified one of the countries that is a party to newly revised trade agreements that require carmakers to use more components made in the United States. It is Canada, not China.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Poland Elections Test Governing Party\u2019s Populist Message", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWARSAW \u2014 In one of Warsaw\u2019s most run-down neighborhoods, where glittering new towers across the Vistula River shimmer in the distance but many people live in graffiti-clad buildings largely left to crumble since World War II, the Polish rapper Piotr Szot had a message for the crowd.The city\u2019s elite may deride supporters of the country\u2019s governing party, Law and Justice, and its candidate for mayor of Warsaw, Patryk Jaki, as a low-class hoodlum \u201cfrom the block.\u201dGood, he said. That means Mr. Jaki is one of them.\u201cPeople from the town hall keep humiliating and spitting on us,\u201d Mr. Jaki, a 33-year-old firebrand, told the crowd recently when he took the stage later in the evening. \u201cThey don\u2019t want us to take over the town hall, because they\u2019re afraid of what we\u2019ll find there.\u201dThe emotional appeal to historical grievance and the targeting of voters who feel left behind despite Poland\u2019s booming economy are strategies that worked well for the right-wing and populist Law and Justice party when it swept to power in 2015 on the strength of the rural vote. It is hoping to use a similar strategy to make inroads in the nation\u2019s largest urban centers and powerful provincial councils.But nearly every major city \u2014 from Krakow in the south to Gdansk in the north to Warsaw in between \u2014 is currently controlled by opposition parties. The elections on Sunday will be test for Law and Justice: Can that same far-right populism seep into the cities?Fifteen of Poland\u2019s 16 provinces are controlled by the opposition, often through a coalition with the conservative Peasant Party.For Law and Justice, there would be no greater victory than winning the office of the powerful Warsaw mayor. There are few candidates who represent the party\u2019s style more than Mr. Jaki, the current deputy justice minister. His chief opponent, Rafal Trzaskowski, 46, of the Civic Coalition, which bands together the largest opposition parties, worries that with 14 candidates on the ballot \u2014 most running in opposition to Law and Justice \u2014 his support will be diluted in the first round of voting.For all the sweeping changes that the party has set in motion, many of its efforts to change the culture in Poland have been stymied at the local level. That is by design.When Poland broke free from the yoke of the former Soviet Union in 1989 and began to chart its course as an independent nation, leaders were wary of a government structure that centralized power. Local governments were given broad authority to set policy. Most important, they have a great degree of autonomy to direct the spending of billions from the European Union that have helped transform the nation\u2019s infrastructure over the past decade.Oxfam recently ranked Poland among the top countries for fighting income inequality and child poverty.Now, Law and Justice leaders are promising more, telling pensioners that they will receive an extra $80 a month and telling parents that every child will be allocated $80 at the start of the school year. In an attempt to blend social welfare and religious conservatism, the government is also promising $1,100 to women who give birth to disabled children, hoping to discourage abortion.Jerzy Bartkowski, a sociologist at the University of Warsaw, said that Law and Justice had been the biggest beneficiary of Poland\u2019s economic miracle.\u201cRegardless of what they had done, people would have been better off right now,\u201d he said. \u201cUnemployment has decreased, and there is a budget surplus, though it\u2019s not due to any special talents of the government.\u201dThe government has pushed its conservative agenda by restricting access to contraceptives, attempting to ban abortion, hanging crosses in Parliament, removing certain textbooks from the school curriculum and cutting funding for some independent news media.Critics worry that if the party gains ground in localities, it will be able to shape the cultural and ideological landscape even more.Barbara Nowacka, a left-wing leader of the Civic Coalition, said the government wanted \u201ctotal control on all levels\u201d with \u201cno freedom of speech and thought.\u201d\u201cThey want to decide what we watch in cinemas, theaters; what our children are taught at school,\u201d Ms. Nowacka said in an interview. \u201cAll of this can be subject to political agenda.\u201dWhile Law and Justice is the dominant force in more traditional towns and villages with a population of fewer than 50,000 people \u2014 and home to 65 percent of voters \u2014 Poland\u2019s urban centers remain bastions of more liberal and inclusive politics.He once compared allowing Muslim migrants into the country to the Nazi invasion of 1939. In the days before the election, the party began running television ads suggesting that the opposition wanted to bring Muslim migrants to Poland. One clip shows a man kicking a woman down the stairs in a Berlin subway station. It turned out the man was Bulgarian, not a Muslim migrant.Still, Mr. Jaki defended the campaign, saying that he had been to the West and did not want to see things \u201cblown up\u201d in Warsaw. If his opponent is elected, he said, \u201cyou can\u2019t be guaranteed that won\u2019t happen.\u201dMr. Jaki has the good fortune to be running at time when the current mayor, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, is weighed down by scandal, including corruption in her office and the unlawful restitution of property in Warsaw. She is not running for re-election.Bozena Kirejczyk, 53, a brand developer who lived in America for 23 years before returning to Poland seven years ago, said Mr. Jaki\u2019s blunt style was needed.\u201cI witnessed the opposition trampling human dignity, trampling poor people,\u201d she said at the rap rally. \u201cI love my country, but it hurts to see how some people have been humiliated time and time again.\u201dMr. Trzaskowski said that simple sloganeering would not be enough to win over voters in Warsaw. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to use populist rhetoric and say all migrants are rapists who will rape our women,\u201d he said in an interview in his downtown office. \u201cIt takes 10 seconds.\u201dBut Warsaw, he said, is \u201cone of the most tolerant, open and ambitious cities in Europe,\u201d and he said he believed that voters would see past the rhetoric. \u201cThe future of the city is at stake,\u201d he said.Mr. Trzaskowski expressed confidence that he would secure a runoff with Mr. Jaki but said he was not taking anything for granted.\u201cIt will be close,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be blood and tears and it will go to the end. But I think I will win.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Stephen King Reviews Tana French\u2019s \u2018Extraordinary\u2019 New Novel", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\u201cI\u2019ve always considered myself to be, basically, a lucky person.\u201dThat\u2019s the first line of Tana French\u2019s extraordinary new novel, \u201cThe Witch Elm,\u201d and much of what follows is a meditation on luck \u2014 the good, the bad and the extremely ugly. Here\u2019s a things-go-bad story Thomas Hardy could have written in his prime, although the Hardy version would probably contain no lines such as \u201cI looked like the lowlife in a zombie movie who isn\u2019t going to make it past the first half-hour.\u201dAs a reviewer, it\u2019s my job to at least make a scratch at describing the plot of the novel, but as a fellow novelist, I balk at giving more than a few bare details. (In my opinion, the flap copy gives away far too much \u2014 when you know everything that\u2019s going to happen in the first 140 pages or so, somebody went overboard.) A good novel, especially one that fits, however uncomfortably, into the mystery genre, is like an expensive Swiss watch. My job is to admire it, not overwind it.Toby Hennessy, the self-avowed lucky narrator, handles publicity for an art gallery. The current show being prepared features street artists with no fixed address and, in some cases, detailed arrest records: skangers, in French\u2019s pungent Irish argot, which also includes the unforgettable (to me, at least) line \u201cI knew I should eat something, but I couldn\u2019t be arsed.\u201dOne of the artist-skangers, a fellow who goes by the colorful alias of Gouger, shows particular talent, but not quite enough for Tiernan, one of the gallery employees. Our narrator catches Tiernan touching up Gouger\u2019s work to make it more interesting and salable. Toby keeps silent (his moral compass doesn\u2019t always point to true north), but the gallery owner finds out. Tiernan is fired; Toby is not.Shortly thereafter, Toby\u2019s luck runs out. Intruders enter his home, and when Toby catches them at their burglary, they beat him within an inch of his life. He awakes in the hospital with holes in his memory, aphasia, splitting headaches, a limp and PTSD. When he returns to some form of consciousness and a doctor tells him, \u201cYou were very lucky,\u201d the irony is so strong you could bottle it and sell it as a vitamin supplement.So we have the classic mystery-novel situation, right? It\u2019s the whodunit someone, most likely Toby himself, must solve. Was it Tiernan who set up the beating? Was it Richard, the gallery owner? Possibly the mysterious Gouger, seeking vengeance for having been booted from the exhibition?Except the classic situation turns out to be tangential to the main story (although it returns to our attention in the novel\u2019s jaw-dropping final 40 pages). Toby\u2019s moral lapse at the gallery and his subsequent beating recede into the background when he goes to his Uncle Hugo\u2019s house to recuperate, and a skull is found in the wych elm at the foot of the Ivy House garden. I tell you this only because it\u2019s in the damn flap copy, and I trust your own powers of deduction, dear reader, to surmise that an entire skeleton soon follows.So far, so Agatha Christie (who is even name-checked in passing). You have the murder victim, another skanger (although a rich one) whose passing we need not mourn; you have the small pool of possible suspects; you have the manor house with the walled-in garden where the body was discovered. But an Agatha Christie novel might run 250 pages or so. \u201cThe Witch Elm\u201d is twice that length, and I\u2019m relieved to report that those added pages aren\u2019t just filler.They are, in fact, the core of the book, and what lands French\u2019s novel in that twilight zone between mystery and suspense (where this book will undoubtedly be shelved at your local bookstore) and literature. It is a strange and rich territory inhabited by such novelists as Michael Robotham, Laura Lippman, George Pelecanos, James Ellroy and Ruth Rendell. All of these novelists (and a dozen others) have \u201ctranscended the genre,\u201d as they say, none of them in quite the same fashion.The fine-drawn quality of French\u2019s characterizations is one measure of the novel\u2019s above-average success as literary fiction, which is to say fiction that enriches our lives rather than just serving to pass the time on an airplane or in a doctor\u2019s waiting room. I was especially taken by Toby\u2019s cousins, the former wild-child Susanna and the twitchy I\u2019m-gay-so-deal-with-it Leon. The cops are good, too, with their cheerfully matey dialogue and their probing offhand questions. (Uncle Hugo was a bit too saintly for my taste, but you can\u2019t have everything.)Characters aside, the book is lifted by French\u2019s nervy, almost obsessive prose. Although they are of different sexes and nationalities, when I read Tana French I\u2019m always reminded of David Goodis (\u201cDark Passage,\u201d \u201cThe Moon in the Gutter\u201d and \u201cShoot the Piano Player\u201d). She has that same need to go over it, and over it and over it again, like a farmer who can\u2019t plow the field just once but must go at it from every point of the compass, sweating over the wheel of his tractor, not satisfied until every clod has been crumbled away.It\u2019s this obsessiveness, coupled with French\u2019s smooth, almost satiny prose, that made \u201cBroken Harbor\u201d and \u201cThe Secret Place\u201d such knockout books. In the former we see the step-by-step degeneration of a fine mind, mirroring the destruction of the Irish economy following the crash of \u201908; in the latter we spend a feverish day of delirium in a girls\u2019 boarding school. (Warning: There\u2019s a lot of \u201camazeballs!\u201d and \u201ctotes adorbs!\u201d)To read a French novel \u2014 this also goes for Goodis \u2014 is to enter an O.C.D. world where madness seems very close. In \u201cThe Secret Place,\u201d it\u2019s the hormone-driven madness of adolescent girls; in \u201cBroken Harbor,\u201d it\u2019s that of a man who becomes increasingly convinced there are wild animals in the walls of his family\u2019s house. In the current novel, Toby can\u2019t even be sure of his own past and keeps returning to the holes in his memory like a man feeling the gum-cavities where teeth used to be. He\u2019s about as far from Miss Marple as amateur detectives come, and yet he stumbles to some semblance of a solution, just the same.Two scenes, both involving Toby and his cousins, are avatars of how French, like Goodis, doubles back on herself, not so much narrating as drilling down. Both are conversations running about 35 pages each. In lesser hands, these scenes would be a trudge. In French\u2019s, the reader simply can\u2019t let go. There\u2019s a delirious intensity to them that seems to be French\u2019s sole property. It\u2019s not about the dialogue, as in a George V. Higgins or Richard Price novel; it\u2019s about the obsession to make sure everything gets said.Is the novel perfect? Nope. There\u2019s a genealogical subplot that goes nowhere, and the elder generation of Hennessys are mere shadows. Toby and his cousins are nearing 30, but in the company of their elders \u2014 whose contributions are sort of like the conversations of adults in the \u201cPeanuts\u201d cartoons, just trombone wah-wah-wahs \u2014 they seem much younger. Saintly Uncle Hugo is an exception, but he\u2019s a bit of a stereotype.These are mere quibbles, the kind reviewers are paid to make, I suppose. The bottom line is this: \u201cThe Witch Elm\u201d is what another novelist, Stewart O\u2019Nan, likes to call \u201ca heapin\u2019 helping.\u201d The prose, as fine as it is, as dense as it is, as obsessive as it is, remains in service to the story. This is good work by a good writer. For the reader, what luck.Stephen King\u2019s next novel, \u201cElevation,\u201d will be published on Oct. 30.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Colorado, a Bitter Battle Over Oil, Gas and the Environment Comes to a Head", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRIGHTON, Colo. \u2014 On stage at the Adams County fairgrounds, the M.C. wore cowgirl boots and a pink T-shirt that read \u201cMothers in Love With Fracking.\u201dIn the audience, more than a thousand oil and gas workers looked on as local leaders issued dire warnings about the effects of a Colorado ballot measure that, if passed, could drastically reduce oil and gas drilling in the state.Thousands of jobs: gone. Millions of dollars: lost. Conservative families: driven out.\u201cThe wolves are at the front door,\u201d insisted one speaker.So far, only New York, Maryland and Vermont have banned fracking altogether. But none of those states have anything close to the reserves of Colorado, which is among the top six states in both oil and gas production.Not surprisingly, the initiative has deepened political fissures in a purple state whose economy counts on oil, but whose lifestyle hinges on access to pristine wilderness. As Colorado\u2019s population has climbed, driven by the cost of living, a growing technology sector and the appeal of the outdoors, the state\u2019s new and old industries have collided. At the same time, environmentally-oriented companies like Patagonia are pressing to become bigger political players in the region, often putting them at odds with the oil and gas lobby.If passed, the measure \u2014 Proposition 112 \u2014 would require companies to place new wells at least 2,500 feet from homes, schools, waterways and other areas designated as \u201cvulnerable,\u201d two-and-a-half to five times the current state regulation. Even as the measure faces fierce resistance, industry leaders and environmentalists alike acknowledge that it could succeed. One recent industry poll obtained by The New York Times showed 43 percent of voters in favor, with 41 percent opposed.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Efforts to pass less extreme restrictions have failed, and in some neighborhoods, frustration has reached a fever pitch.\u201cIt\u2019s really community members against Goliath,\u201d said Russell Mendell, 33, a volunteer with Colorado Rising, the main group supporting the measure.Laurie Anderson, 45, a mechanical engineer and mother of five who has been fighting a large well project in her community, called the proposition \u201cour only option.\u201d\u201cIt has to be a grass-roots, citizen-led effort,\u201d she said.In a high-stakes election year, the proposition is likely to bring out voters on both sides of the political aisle, intensifying races for the governor\u2019s office and several contested congressional seats.Proponents of the measure say it is a common-sense regulation meant to protect people forced to breathe fracking-related fumes and live near explosion-prone sites. Opponents say it would cripple some Colorado communities, stripping the state of 43,000 jobs and more than $200 million in tax revenue in the first year alone. By 2030, lost tax revenue could hit $1.1 billion.The real goal, they contend, is to halt drilling in Colorado altogether, before moving on to places like California and New Mexico.\u201cThis is not a reasonable measure for health and safety,\u201d said Kathleen Sgamma, president of the Western Energy Alliance, an industry group. \u201cThis is a measure to shut down the entire industry.\u201dAt a time of deep political division, the measure has also emerged as a proxy battle over the direction of the state with national implications \u2014 putting to the test a tug of war between economic development and environmental protections that has reached critical levels of tension in the Trump era.Colorado is split in thirds among Republicans, Democrats and independents, and many who support the measure say it is a chance to put a progressive stamp on a purple state.Those who oppose it say it is a liberal effort to drive a working-class industry \u2014 and its conservative employees \u2014 out of the state for good. Industry jobs pay an average of $117,000 a year, twice the typical state salary, according to federal data.At the Brighton rally just north of Denver, many said that they never went to college, but that industry jobs had allowed them to stay in Colorado, raise a family, and buy a home. If the measure passed, they said, they would likely move to oil fields in Texas or North Dakota.\u201cThe people that oppose this industry, they treat us as if we\u2019re really evil,\u201d said Cody Doane, 45, a service specialist who stood with his twins, Everleigh Halli and Adler Burton \u2014 named for the company that had given their family everything: Halliburton.\u201cThey want to ban oil and gas and chase us out of this state,\u201d he said.Supporters of the anti-fracking measure, who are being outspent roughly 40-1, according to the secretary of state, see a steep road ahead.Their main organizing group has raised just $800,000. And their effort is opposed not only by oil and gas companies and Republican politicians, but also by much of the Democratic establishment, with officials like Gov. John Hickenlooper expressing deep concern about the economic fallout.Colorado residents have argued for years over how to balance drilling with the protection of human and environmental health. But tension has hit a high in the last decade with the increased use of hydraulic fracturing.In the Denver suburbs, residents have tried repeatedly to move fracking operations farther from their homes, only to be stymied by their own representatives, the State Supreme Court and a regulatory agency they see as preferential to industry.Supporters of the setback measure believe this anger will carry them to victory.In Erie, Colo., Beth Ewaskowitz, 48, a pharmacologist who lives near dozens of wells, became a symbol of the oil and gas fight this year when she sent her 6-year-old son\u2019s blood to be tested for chemicals associated with fracking operations. A local doctor found her son in the 79th to 85th percentile for three of them \u2014 benzene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene \u2014 and her story was picked up by local news media.\u201cI understand it isn\u2019t, \u2018I have high blood levels, therefore the villain is fracking,\u2019\u201d Ms. Ewaskowitz said. \u201cHowever, if it\u2019s not the fracking, then what? What? And if you can\u2019t tell, what am I supposed to do with that?\u201dBut the oil and gas rally brought out plenty of workers who called Colorado\u2019s fracking industry the safest in the nation.At the front by the stage, Matt Smith, 42, stood with his children, Parker, Pepper, Peyton and Preston, ages 3 through 12. Parker slept in his arms, her ponytail drooped over one arm, her blue boots hanging over another.The older children had missed school for this event.\u201cThis affects their lives,\u201d said Mr. Smith, a Halliburton employee. \u201cWhat happens in November will in turn affect their lives. Whether I have a job or not, whether we get to stay, to keep living where all my children were born.\u201dHe went on: \u201cThe sooner they are in touch with what goes on in the real world, the better.\u201dJulie Turkewitz reported from Brighton, Colo., and Clifford Krauss from Houston.Follow Julie Turkewitz and Clifford Krauss on Twitter @julieturkewitz and @ckrauss.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Meet the Would-Be House Committee Leaders Who Could Torment Trump", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut if the Democrats take the House on Nov. 6, they will assume control of two of the most powerful tools in Washington: gavels and subpoenas. With chairmanships would come the power to compel the Trump administration to produce evidence, to call witnesses to the stand and to show voters \u2014 ahead of 2020 \u2014 how Democrats would run the government if given the chance.JudiciaryMr. Nadler has said he would tread more carefully around the ongoing investigation of Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. In the short term, that means protecting the special counsel overseeing the inquiry, Robert S. Mueller III. But when Mr. Mueller\u2019s work is complete, Mr. Nadler would be a key Democrat deciding whether to open an impeachment inquiry. The committee also has jurisdiction over some of the Democrats\u2019 highest policy priorities, including writing laws on guns, immigration policy and voting rights. Oversight and Government ReformThe son of sharecroppers, Mr. Cummings, 67, thinks he can pull it off. He is a blunt and fiery liberal beloved by his caucus who prizes strong working relationships with Republicans.\u201cThis is not about trying to get any retribution. It is about trying to bring us back to a sense of integrity,\u201d he said.Financial ServicesIf Democrats take control, Ms. Waters can strike back. She has watched, unhappily, as Republicans have watered down the Dodd-Frank Act, the Obama-era legislation aimed at reining in risky banking practices and protecting consumers. At the helm of the Financial Services Committee, Ms. Waters would almost certainly move to undo the Republicans\u2019 changes and put teeth back into the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, though such efforts would have trouble passing a Republican Senate.\u201cFinancial services issues are critical for all Americans and for our economy,\u201d she said in an emailed statement, \u201cand I am focused on making sure that our financial system is fair.\u201dAppropriationsWomen have been a driving force behind the Democrats\u2019 push to retake the House. If they are successful, Ms. Lowey would be the first chairwoman of the Appropriations Committee, the powerful panel that controls discretionary spending.Look for Ms. Lowey, 81, to use the power of the purse to advance spending legislation that reflects the Democrats\u2019 policy goals, including expanding access to health care, lowering prescription drug prices, and increasing funding for child care and early education programs. She led a successful push earlier this year to fund gun violence prevention studies at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the agency had avoided such research for 20 years, fearing political repercussions. She said she intended to make certain such studies get underway. Separately, she will press for expanded funding for birth control and work to block Republican efforts to reduce spending on family planning or eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood.\u201cIn my work as a woman appropriator,\u201d Ms. Lowey said, \u201cI want to make sure that we\u2019re protecting women\u2019s health, women\u2019s rights.\u201dArmed ServicesAt 53, he is one of the younger potential chairmen, though he has served in the House for more than 20 years.Education and the WorkforceA soft-spoken but forceful presence on Capitol Hill, Mr. Scott, 71, is the first African-American elected to Congress from Virginia since Reconstruction and a Harvard-educated former civil rights lawyer. He has been a sharp critic of Betsy DeVos, the education secretary.High on Mr. Scott\u2019s list is addressing inequities in education. He has repeatedly called on the department to work harder to close the achievement gap between white students and minorities \u2014 and has accused Ms. DeVos of permitting states to flout a law that requires schools to make progress toward that goal.It will also be up to Mr. Scott to try to make good on the Democrats\u2019 promise to make college education affordable. He and his fellow Democrats have already introduced legislation, the Aim Higher Act, to expand access to federal student loans, provide states with grants that would help students graduate from community college debt-free, and crack down on predatory for-profit colleges.Energy and CommerceIf Republicans still control the Senate, major Democratic priorities, like legislation addressing climate change, are probably headed nowhere. But Mr. Pallone, a member of the Progressive Caucus, could certainly raise the profile of his party\u2019s solutions and could use the committee for hearings into malfeasance in the private sector.Foreign AffairsIntelligenceThe committee\u2019s divisive investigation into Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election made its Democratic members some of the best-known names in Washington \u2014 none more so than Mr. Schiff. But the meticulous former federal prosecutor from greater Los Angeles sees its work on the issue as far from done.\u201cOne of the issues that is of great concern to me is: Were the Russians laundering money through the Trump Organization,\u201d Mr. Schiff said in a recent interview. \u201cThat to me would be far more powerful kompromat than any video.\u201dMr. Schiff has said he will make restoring \u201ccomity\u201d on the committee a priority after two years of intense partisan infighting.Transportation and InfrastructureConsidered one of the last opportunities for bipartisanship action, infrastructure could be one of the first action items on the Democrats\u2019 to-do list, and the president may find an unlikely ally in Mr. DeFazio. The 71-year-old chairman-in-waiting has signaled his willingness to work with Mr. Trump, and the president himself has publicly mused that there\u2019s \u201ca chance\u201d House Democrats and he will \u201cget along and get along well.\u201dWays and MeansThe powerful Ways and Means Committee writes tax law, signs off on trade deals, and oversees Social Security and Medicare. Mr. Neal, an institutionally minded western Massachusetts Democrat, wants to make serious policy pushes in almost all of those areas.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Biggest Questions in Nevada\u2019s Crucial Senate Race", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDissatisfaction with President Trump among Nevada voters has not had quite the ripple effect Democrats are hoping for in the state\u2019s highly competitive Senate race, and turnout among Hispanics for that contest in November remains a key question for the party, according to results in a New York Times/Siena College poll this week.Roughly as many Nevadans approve of Mr. Trump\u2019s job performance as disapprove, and they are also about evenly split on the Senate candidates. In the phone survey of more than 640 registered Nevada voters, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, Senator Dean Heller held a slight edge over his Democratic challenger, Representative Jacky Rosen.Mr. Heller is considered the Republicans\u2019 most endangered incumbent, in a year when his party can only afford to lose one seat and still retain its control of the Senate.\u201cIt\u2019s still anybody\u2019s guess,\u201d Jon Ralston, a prominent political analyst in Nevada and the editor of The Nevada Independent, said in an email about the Senate race.Turnout, especially among nonwhite voters, is a big question for Democrats, who are particularly relying on getting a huge margin of support from Hispanic voters. But in an encouraging sign for Republicans, nearly 40 percent of Hispanics said they would vote for Mr. Heller compared with 52 percent for Ms. Rosen, according to the poll. Only 45 percent of registered Hispanic voters say they were \u201calmost certain to vote,\u201d compared with 63 percent of white voters, and 13 percent of Hispanic registered voters said they were \u201cnot at all likely to vote.\u201dDemocrats are also hoping that Ms. Rosen will benefit from enthusiasm among female voters who are highly energized this year and may want more women elected to Congress. But among female voters, Ms. Rosen holds a razor-thin advantage that is well within the poll\u2019s margin of error.Nevada\u2019s electorate is divided between heavily Republican rural areas in the north, where Mr. Heller draws his strength, and a growing Democratic population around Las Vegas in the south. The state remains deeply purple: Hillary Clinton carried it by about two points in 2016 but it has not had a Democratic governor since 1999. In other recent opinion polls, voters cite the economy, immigration and health care as top issues.The Upshot has partnered with Siena College to poll dozens of the most competitive House and Senate races across the country.Mr. Heller, a longtime politician in the state, is more well known but has also run a relatively staid campaign. Nevadans are about evenly split on his favorability and unfavorability ratings.Even the bitterly partisan confirmation process for Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh \u2014 which roared into prominence in other competitive Senate races \u2014 did not rise to much of a talking point for either candidate until after Mr. Kavanaugh was confirmed. On Saturday, Mr. Heller criticized how Democrats had handled the process, suggesting it would galvanize his Republican base.\u201cDemocrats think political games and smears will win them votes, but it only fuels our momentum,\u201d he wrote.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.In its own statement, the Rosen campaign called Mr. Heller \u201cout of touch with Nevadans\u201d and warned that voters would \u201chold Senator Heller accountable for becoming just another rubber stamp for President Trump\u2019s nominees and his reckless agenda in Washington.\u201dDemocrats say Mr. Heller has weaknesses, including his recent decision to align himself with President Trump.But Mr. Heller has never lost a race, and Republicans across the country are hopeful that the Kavanaugh issue will be the energizing force the party needed to spur voters to the polls.Nate Cohn contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pitts, Georgia, 5:30 P.M.", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "Documenting moments across the country, large and small, quiet and indelible.Supported byWhen this project was being conceived, a storm named Florence did not exist. It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L. Whitfield sermonized from the Gospel According to John. In one of the pews they built a dollhouse out of Bibles. Pastor Whitfield was baptized in the bayou that runs behind the church 54 years ago.

{"Headline": "Are the Danes Melancholy? Are the Swedes Sad?", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe truth about the Nordic economies.Opinion ColumnistBut is a negative assessment of the Nordic economies really right? That\u2019s not at all clear. That lower G.D.P. number conceals two important points. First, by any measure people in the lower part of the income distribution are much better off in Nordic societies than their U.S. counterparts. That is, there is a lot less misery in Scandinavia \u2014 and because everyone has some chance of falling into low income, this reduces the risk of misery for a much larger share of the population.So I thought it might be useful to put together some information on how the Nordic economies actually compare to the U.S.First of all, the Nordics really have made drastically different choices in public policy. They aren\u2019t \u201csocialist,\u201d if that means government control of the means of production. They are, however, quite strongly social-democratic: as Exhibit 1 shows, they have high taxes, which finance much more generous social benefits than we have here. They also have policies on wages, working hours, and more that tilt the balance toward workers in a number of dimensions.But this understates the case, because these data don\u2019t include \u201cin kind\u201d benefits like health care and education. All of the Nordic countries have universal health care \u2014 not just single-payer, but for the most part direct government provision (a.k.a. \u201csocialized medicine.\u201d) This compares with the U.S. where \u2014 especially before the Affordable Care Act went into effect \u2014 lack of health insurance was common even for families near median income, and high deductibles are an obstacle to care even for many of the insured.Nordic education also lacks the glaring inequality in quality all too characteristic of the U.S. system.Once you take these benefits into account, it\u2019s likely that at least half the Nordic population are better off materially than their U.S. counterparts. But what about the upper half?As the CEA notes, real G.D.P. per capita is lower in the Nordics than in the U.S., and that\u2019s reflected in those lower incomes for the upper half of the income distribution. But it\u2019s worth looking at why G.D.P. is lower.Once you take vacations into account, Denmark and Sweden basically look comparable in performance to the U.S. Finland looks worse, but this is something of a special case: the Finnish economy has been ailing for a number of years, not because of socialism, but because its two premier exports \u2014 Nokia and wood pulp \u2014 were hit hard by technological change, and membership in the euro has made adjustment difficult.The point for welfare comparisons is that while Nordic families at, say, the 60th percentile of the income distribution have lower purchasing power than their American counterparts, they also have much more free time and an arguably better work-life balance. Are they really worse off? You can make a good case that taking all of this into account, the majority of Nordic citizens are actually better off than Americans.The bottom line is that real G.D.P. per capita isn\u2019t everything, and you shouldn\u2019t uncritically use that measure to judge how social democracy is working in Scandinavia.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Proposes to Lower Drug Prices by Basing Them on Other Countries\u2019 Costs", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump proposed on Thursday that Medicare pay for certain prescription drugs based on the prices paid in other advanced industrial countries \u2014 a huge change that could save money for the government and for millions of Medicare beneficiaries.As part of a demonstration project covering half the country, Medicare would establish an \u201cinternational pricing index\u201d and use it as a benchmark in deciding how much to pay for drugs covered by Part B of Medicare.\u201cThis is a revolutionary change,\u201d Mr. Trump said in a speech on Thursday at the Department of Health and Human Services. \u201cNobody\u2019s had the courage to do it, or they just didn\u2019t want to do it.\u201dOn Thursday, the Trump administration offered an answer \u2014 but the drug proposal would take effect in late 2019 or early 2020 at the earliest.Trump administration officials said they had the authority to use the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation created by the Affordable Care Act to carry out the proposal. That agency has wide discretion to conduct demonstration projects. The Trump administration will accept public comments before starting the project. But the proposal will most likely face fierce political resistance from drug makers, some health care providers and some Republicans in Congress, and it could also be subject to legal challenges.\u201cThe administration is imposing foreign price controls from countries with socialized health care systems that deny their citizens access and discourage innovation,\u201d said Stephen J. Ubl, the president and chief executive of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the main trade group for the industry. He said the proposal would \u201cthreaten patient access to innovative lifesaving medicines.\u201dDemocrats had their own reasons for skepticism.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to take the Trump administration and Republicans seriously about reducing health care costs for seniors two weeks before the election when they have repeatedly advocated for and implemented policies that strip away protections for people with pre-existing conditions and lead to increased health care costs for millions of Americans,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.\u201cThe current international drug-pricing system has put America in last place,\u201d Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, said in unveiling the report.Mr. Trump cited the government\u2019s international drug-pricing report in his speech on Thursday, saying he was taking aim at \u201cglobal free riding\u201d that forces Americans to subsidize drug prices in other countries.\u201cAmericans pay more so that other countries can pay less,\u201d Mr. Trump said.The report compares prices charged by drug manufacturers in the United States and 16 other countries for 27 drugs that are covered by Part B of Medicare.\u201cOver all,\u201d the report said, \u201cprices and reimbursement rates for Part B drugs are significantly higher for U.S. providers than purchasers outside the U.S.\u201d\u201cMedicare could achieve significant savings,\u201d it added, \u201cif prices in the U.S. were similar to those of other large market-based economies.\u201dMedicare beneficiaries are generally responsible for 20 percent of the cost of drugs covered by Part B of the program. So if Medicare reduces its payment, the cost to beneficiaries will be \u201csimilarly proportionately reduced,\u201d the administration said.However, most beneficiaries now have supplemental insurance, such as a Medigap policy or retiree health benefits, to help pay their share of the bill for drugs covered under Part B of Medicare.The new method of payment proposed by the Trump administration would be phased in from 2020 to 2025. \u201cOverall savings for American taxpayers and patients are projected to total $17.2 billion over five years,\u201d Mr. Azar said.Among the drugs included in the study were Aranesp, for patients with anemia caused by chemotherapy or chronic kidney disease; several cancer medicines, such as Avastin, Herceptin and Keytruda; Lucentis, for eye conditions that can cause vision loss; and Rituxan, for rheumatoid arthritis and certain types of cancer. The list prices for Keytruda and many other new cancer medicines are substantially more than $100,000 a year.As an example, Mr. Trump said: \u201cOne common cancer drug is nearly seven times as expensive for Medicare as it is for other countries. This is a highly used and very effective drug.\u201d The president was apparently referring to Treanda, a cancer treatment sold by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries.The report was notable for several reasons.It uses foreign drug prices as a reference or benchmark to judge prices in the United States. In many foreign countries, officials negotiate prices with drug manufacturers. While Democrats have long pushed for such negotiations, Republicans in this country have blocked them, fearing Medicare could eventually dictate prices or restrict access to drugs deemed to be too expensive.Foreign countries \u201cuse their national health systems to negotiate lower prices in exchange for market access,\u201d the Trump administration said in its report.Democrats were still pushing a more direct route. \u201cOn the eve of the midterm elections, the president is proposing a small step on drug price relief when a giant leap is urgently needed,\u201d said Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont. \u201cInstead of nibbling around the edges, he should demand in his State of the Union speech that Congress send to his desk within 30 days a broad price negotiation bill that applies to all drugs in the Medicare program.\u201dMedicare has historically paid 106 percent of the \u201caverage sales price\u201d for drugs that patients receive by infusion or injection in doctors\u2019 offices. Medicare drug spending has been growing rapidly \u2014 at an average rate of about 9.5 percent a year since 2009, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, an independent agency that advises Congress.The Trump administration said the current payment formula could provide financial incentives for some doctors and hospitals to use \u201cthe highest-priced clinically beneficial product.\u201dThe new report acknowledged many \u201climitations\u201d in the data used for its international price comparisons. The formulation of drugs, their dosage and their strength may differ from country to country, it said.Prices cited in the study \u201cmay not accurately reflect the actual amount paid in the U.S. or abroad,\u201d because they generally do not show the effects of rebates offered by drug manufacturers, the report said.Obama administration officials were also troubled by the rapid growth of spending for drugs covered by Part B of Medicare. In March 2016, they proposed a nationwide experiment to reduce payments for many of these drugs. But they scrapped the plan nine months later after it was criticized by pharmaceutical companies, doctors, patients and members of Congress from both parties, who said it could jeopardize access to important medicines.Mr. Azar said the Trump administration proposal was \u201cmore radical\u201d than Mr. Obama\u2019s.About two-thirds of Part B drug spending is for biotechnology drugs known as biologics.Countries included in the Trump administration\u2019s drug price comparisons, besides the United States, were Austria, Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "California Today: The State Faces Some Big Problems. Are We Ready?", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayGood morning.The race for governor of California \u2014 between Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor, and John Cox, a Republican business executive \u2014 is one of the least competitive contests in the nation. This is a Democratic state, and polls show Mr. Newsom with a substantial lead.But the fact that there is little suspense about the outcome does not mean this is not an important contest that deserves examination. Jerry Brown, who has been governor for eight years, is stepping down just at a moment when California is facing challenges that would test the most experienced chief executive.On one hand, the California economy is roaring along. It is the fifth largest in the world, making it a driving force in the national economy. Unemployment is at a record low. It has the most billionaires in the country. When Mr. Brown took office, he faced a $26 billion deficit; the state now has a surplus of close to $16 billion.But most economists \u2014 as well as Mr. Brown and Mr. Newsom \u2014 warn a recession is in the state\u2019s near future. (Mr. Cox told us he does not hold this view.) And economic downturns in California are notoriously damaging because of the state\u2019s reliance on high-income taxpayers for revenue. A recession would force the next governor and Legislature to consider deep cuts in spending.And the next governor is going to face big financial demands as well \u2014 starting with a housing and homelessness crisis. The affordable housing shortage threatens to cause a labor shortage, because workers cannot find homes near their jobs. Policies embraced by President Trump \u2014 including tariffs on Chinese goods and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants \u2014 could be harmful to this state\u2019s economy, with the nation\u2019s two largest ports and a sprawling network of farms reliant on immigrant workers.Sorry for the gloom and doom, but it seemed a topic better explored before Election Day than after.Have you seen an 800-pound hammer? Because the police in Healdsburg are trying to find one.It disappeared from the city\u2019s community center lawn over the weekend, Officer Darryl Erkel said Wednesday. At first, he said the authorities wondered if it was a prank. But the 21-foot-long piece of art \u201cjust hasn\u2019t shown up,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cwe have no leads.\u201dThe artist who created the piece, Doug Unkrey, is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to its recovery, a city spokeswoman said.All of which leads to another question: Why does someone even want an 800-pound hammer this badly?\u201cWhere are you going to put it?\u201d Mr. Unkrey asked in an interview with The Press Democrat.Added Officer Erkel on Wednesday: \u201cI highly doubt it\u2019s in someone\u2019s personal art exhibit.\u201dCalifornia Today is edited by Julie Bloom, who grew up in Los Angeles and graduated from U.C.

But defense work is already part of Silicon Valley\u2019s DNA.Ms. O\u2019Mara, a professor of history, is the author of a forthcoming book about the origins of Silicon Valley.It may not be a popular position, but Mr. Bezos\u2019s comments reveal an important truth: The Pentagon has been part of the Silicon Valley story all along. Defense contracts during and after World War II turned Silicon Valley from a somnolent landscape of fruit orchards into a hub of electronics production and innovations ranging from mainframes to microprocessors to the internet. The American tech economy rests on the foundations of the military-industrial complex. Yet Silicon Valley\u2019s culture is deeply influenced by skepticism about this same military establishment.The result is an enduring technological optimism. Early Silicon Valley didn\u2019t have a J. Robert Oppenheimer publicly despairing over his murderous creation. Instead, it had an ebullient regional booster, Fred Terman, an engineer and university administrator who used the bounty of military money to turn Stanford from a middling school with a good football team into an engineering powerhouse.Big defense certainly made its mark. The region\u2019s biggest employer from the 1950s through the end of the Cold War was Lockheed. Local start-ups of the time also benefited, and they attracted people with engineering backgrounds, not necessarily military ones. Take, for example, David Packard, the co-founder of Hewlett-Packard. An outspoken critic of government overreach, Packard believed that tech businesses should aspire to higher things. \u201cI think many people assume, wrongly, that a company exists simply to make money,\u201d he once told HP executives. \u201cWhile this is an important result of a company\u2019s existence, we have to go deeper to find the real reasons for our being.\u201dThe next generation of Silicon Valley technologists took these sentiments further. They grew up dreaming of space and winning science fairs supported by defense money; their first encounters with computers were often in government-funded university labs. Yet by the time they graduated from college in the late 1960s and early 1970s, many of them wanted nothing to do with the military-industrial complex. So they seeded companies that repurposed technologies built for war to everyday life. They stayed in academia, moved into industrial research labs or started storefront computer-education centers and community message boards.Then they founded computer companies infused with an ethos that was part counterculture, part cowboy. \u201cThe personal computer operator is the Electronic Man on Horseback riding into the (sinking) Western sun,\u201d declared a columnist in the newsletter InfoWorld in 1980. \u201cHe is the last of the rugged individualists, and the personal computer is his only effective weapon.\u201dWhether their employees realize it or not, today\u2019s tech giants all contain some defense-industry DNA. The result is the conflicted identity we now see in Silicon Valley. Margaret O\u2019Mara, a professor of history at the University of Washington, is the author of a forthcoming book, \u201cThe Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It's 2018 and Tunisians Are Still Mad as Hell", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe government\u2019s failure to improve the economy and the lives of young people has led to a flood of protests. Mr. McCarthy is the author of a book about Tunisia\u2019s Ennahda PartyWhat Tunisia\u2019s politicians have achieved over the past seven years is remarkable for the Arab world. Parliamentary elections in 2011 and 2014 and presidential elections in 2014 have been free and fair and the losers accepted their defeat. Politicians wrote a new, progressive constitution, and a transitional justice process has slowly begun to reckon with the crimes of the past.Political maneuvering ahead of presidential elections next year is behind the falling out between Nidaa Tounes and Ennahda. In municipal elections in May, Ennahda performed well. But Nidaa Tounes came out worse than expected, a sign the party is no longer energizing its base.The government has come under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to shrink the public sector, end subsidies, and tackle inefficiencies at state-run firms. Ministers have reluctantly begun to comply, but social costs are high \u2014 and waves of demonstrations follow.The Tunisian General Labor Union has called a public sector strike for this month and a Civil Service strike for November to oppose government austerity measures. The union wants higher wages and a freeze on public sector job cuts. But many of these protests aren\u2019t organized by political parties, unions or civil society groups. Protesters are demanding jobs and a bigger proportion of state spending in marginalized regions. Last year, thousands of protesters in the southern governorate of Tataouine, whose official unemployment rate of 32 percent is the highest in the country, staged weeks of sit-ins and roadblocks to demand jobs in the local oil industry. They shut off a tap on a pipeline in the desert, halting the flow of oil from Tunisia\u2019s modest reserves. The campaign was a highly energized reaction to decades of exclusion. The government calmed the protests for now with a stopgap promise of thousands of public sector jobs.The catalyst of the Arab Spring was a broken social contract. No longer could authoritarian regimes afford to pay for an oversized public administration, free quality health care and education, and food and fuel subsidies, which they presented in return for their populations\u2019 coerced political quiescence. Cronyism and corruption flourished.Far from providing the political will to engineer a new social contract, the consensus politics of recent years has instead delivered a conservative transition. Not only have redistributive reforms been sidelined, but there has been an incremental decay in the quality of democracy.In January, when a rise in sales tax met with nationwide protests, police arrested 800 demonstrators. This past summer civil society organizations united in condemnation of a worrying new law regulating their work.This is not yet a reversion to the authoritarian past. But nor is it the dignified, democratic future Tunisians have been struggling for. A fresh starting point would be to reform the tax, investment and banking laws that have for so long enriched a well-connected business elite, and to redistribute spending to long-neglected regions of the country.Rory McCarthy is a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, and author of \u201cInside Tunisia\u2019s al-Nahda: Between Politics and Preaching.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Trump and Republicans Offer a Midterm Pitch, if Not a Plan", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJERUSALEM \u2014 The 2017 Republican tax cuts have been a dud on the campaign trail ahead of the November midterm elections, so President Trump has come up with a new plan: more tax cuts.In Nevada on Saturday, Mr. Trump said he and Republican lawmakers had been working on \u201ca very major tax cut\u201d for middle-income people that would be rolled out in the coming weeks.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in an interview on Sunday that he had been working diligently with Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, to develop another tax plan that would be released \u201cshortly.\u201d\u201cThis is specifically focused on the middle class and not beyond that,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said in Jerusalem on the first stop of his six-country Middle East trip.Mr. Mnuchin said the president asked Treasury officials and Republican lawmakers to focus on developing a middle-class tax plan. But he could not offer details about which tax brackets might have lower rates or say if the package would include more generous deductions. Nor has anyone explained how \u2014 or whether \u2014 the plan would be financed or if it would again add to the nation\u2019s ballooning deficit.Last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut is expected to add $1 trillion to the nation\u2019s deficit, though Republican lawmakers continue to insist the tax bill will pay for itself with stronger economic growth.Mr. Mnuchin said the effect that the size and timing of the additional cuts would have on the nation\u2019s finances was being taken into consideration. That could mean that the administration would seek to offset the tax cuts with spending cuts, or by raising taxes on other groups of taxpayers.Mr. Mnuchin said the real driver of the debt was government spending, echoing Mr. Trump\u2019s complaint that Democrats insisted on an increase in funding of domestic programs in exchange for approving more money for the military.House Republicans have moved to extend last year\u2019s individual tax cuts, which are set to expire in 2025, while the corporate tax cuts are permanent. The bill passed the House last month with little fanfare or effect on polling in key House races, and the legislation was dead on arrival in the Senate, where Republicans hold a razor-thin majority.\u201cThis would be different than what the House had already passed,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said. \u201cIt\u2019s in addition, it\u2019s not instead of.\u201dThe Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress\u2019 independent scorekeeper for tax cuts, predicts that Americans earning $100,000 a year or more will reap 75 percent of the savings from the cuts next year. If Congress allows the individual income tax cuts to expire as planned, the committee predicts that middle-class and low-income Americans will face tax increases in 2025, while high earners as a group continue to enjoy a tax cut.Democrats have hammered the cuts as a giveaway to the wealthy, which is one reason the tax overhaul has not given Republicans the electoral benefits they expected.After racing the cuts through Congress in two months last year, and passing them without a single Democratic vote in either chamber, Republicans insisted that the new law would buoy their prospects in the midterms. Polling and candidate messaging suggest that has not been the case.Alan Rappeport reported from Jerusalem, and Jim Tankersley from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Attacks the Fed as Stocks Fall and the Midterms Loom", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump responded to falling stock prices on Thursday by continuing to throw rocks at the Federal Reserve, which he has described as \u201ccrazy,\u201d \u201cloco,\u201d \u201cgoing wild\u201d and \u201cout of control\u201d for slowly raising interest rates against the backdrop of a booming economy.No other modern president has publicly attacked the Fed with such venom or frequency. Indeed, some scholars said the only close historical parallel was with President Andrew Jackson, who campaigned successfully in the 1830s to close the Fed\u2019s predecessor, the Second Bank of the United States.Mr. Trump\u2019s pointed remarks reflect the high political stakes less than a month before midterm elections that have been cast by his political opponents as a referendum on his presidency. Mr. Trump has been riding the economy hard, bragging about job creation, tax cuts and reduced federal regulation, and claiming credit for the rise of the stock market. Now that the market has lost 5 percent of its value in the last week, Mr. Trump is insisting someone else is to blame.The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index closed at 2,728.37 on Thursday, down 2.06 percent.In fact, despite the stock market\u2019s plunge, the American economy continues to grow, which is what is prompting the Fed to raise interest rates and drawing the president\u2019s ire. The Fed\u2019s chairman, Jerome H. Powell, has said that the economy is in a \u201cparticularly bright moment\u201d and that he sees no clouds on the horizon.But after hitching his political fortunes to the rise of the stock market, Mr. Trump is now looking to decouple himself from its fall. Republicans are instead emphasizing continued economic growth and the lowest unemployment rate since 1969.So far, the president\u2019s comments have made little impression on market expectations about Fed policy. Unlike Jackson\u2019s concerted campaign, Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks appear curiously unmoored from the policies of his own administration or the longstanding goals of the Republican Party. Mr. Trump\u2019s own aides have insisted that the president\u2019s remarks are personal musings, not an attempt to dictate policy.The Fed has also brushed off the attacks; it still expected to raise rates in December for the fourth time this year.Mr. Powell emphasized that the decision to raise rates to a range between 2 and 2.25 percent was not intended to get in the way of continued growth. \u201cMy colleagues and I are doing all we can to keep the economy strong, healthy and moving forward,\u201d he said.A spokeswoman declined to comment on Thursday.Some experts warned that a continued assault on the Fed could have long-lasting consequences.Peter Conti-Brown, a professor of legal studies at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of a political history of the Fed, pointed to the example of the F.B.I., another institution Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked by raising questions about the integrity of its decision making. Mr. Conti-Brown said technocratic institutions are insulated from political pressure by public confidence. If confidence erodes, it becomes harder for technocrats to resist the politicians.The F.B.I. has seen a loss of leadership, an erosion of morale and an increase in congressional scrutiny.\u201cHow long before the Fed is looking at its political context and saying, \u2018We can\u2019t stick our heads out as far as we need to,\u2019\u201d Mr. Conti-Brown asked rhetorically. \u201cHow long will people stay if the job itself becomes terrible, and there are protesters everywhere you go?\u201d\u201cI think the Fed has gone crazy,\u201d he told reporters on Wednesday afternoon. Later in the day, speaking with Fox News, he continued to increase the heat. \u201cThe Fed is going wild,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what their problem is. They are raising interest rates and it\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not right,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary, and I think I know more about it than they do.\u201dMr. Trump added that he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with Mr. Powell but did not plan to fire him \u2014 an authority the president may not even have. While the president in theory has the power to remove a Fed chairman \u201cfor cause,\u201d courts have held that the permissible causes do not include policy disagreements.For the moment, Mr. Trump\u2019s criticism of the Fed does not seem to be catching on with Republican candidates. Many Republicans have argued for years that the Fed was waiting too long to raise interest rates, and then that it was moving too slowly. The party is trying to hold on to majorities in the Senate and the House by running on a strong economy and using the heated liberal opposition to Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s Supreme Court confirmation as an example of the threat Democrats pose if they control Congress. That dynamic could change, however, if the stock market continues to fall.Modern presidents have always kept an uneasy eye on the Fed, because its decisions about monetary policy have a significant influence on the pace of economic growth.Until the early 1950s, the Fed essentially operated as an arm of the Treasury Department. Even after the Fed gained operational independence, presidents often opined publicly about what the Fed should do and, if the Fed ignored their advice, they sometimes sought to bend its officials to their will.President Lyndon B. Johnson protested a decision to raise interest rates in the late 1960s by summoning the Fed chairman at the time, William McChesney Martin, to his East Texas ranch and pinning the smaller man against a wall. President Richard M. Nixon instructed aides to blackmail Mr. Martin\u2019s successor, Arthur Burns. President George Bush declared in a State of the Union address that the Fed should keep rates low.But the volume of public commentary greatly diminished in recent decades as politicians concluded that pressuring the Fed was counterproductive. The administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama all made a policy of silence on monetary policy.Krishna Guha, the head of the central bank strategy team at Evercore ISI, said he did not expect Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks to influence the Fed, and he saw no evidence that markets were paying attention. But he added that if Mr. Trump did succeed, he would most likely regret doing so.If Mr. Trump\u2019s attacks convince markets that the Fed may move more slowly, or show greater tolerance of inflation, bond yields would rise, which would put further downward pressure on equity prices.Still, Mr. Guha \u2014 formerly a senior official at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York \u2014 said that the president\u2019s criticisms were not good for the central bank or the future conduct of economic policy.\u201cYou never want to be in a position where some part of society doesn\u2019t just question whether you made the right call or not, but whether you made that call in the public interest,\u201d he said.Mr. Trump\u2019s aides have sought to play down his broadsides. Larry Kudlow, the president\u2019s top economic adviser, said Mr. Trump was just offering his two cents. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s \u2018calling out the Fed,\u2019 quote unquote,\u201d Mr. Kudlow told reporters outside the White House on Thursday morning. \u201cI really mean this. I think he\u2019s giving you his opinion. He is a, obviously, successful businessman, he\u2019s a very well-informed investor. He has his views. But he\u2019s not saying to them, \u2018Change your plan.\u2019\u201dMr. Kudlow added, \u201cHe knows the Fed is independent, and he respects that.\u201dMr. Trump\u2019s criticisms appear strangely at odds with the way he has handled the most powerful means at his disposal to influence monetary policy. Since taking office less than two years ago, he has had the unusual opportunity to fill six of the seven seats on the Fed\u2019s board of governors.He filled the top three positions on the Fed\u2019s board, including the chairman\u2019s job, with members of the Republican policymaking establishment, which has long been committed to keeping inflation firmly under control. Three other nominees, still awaiting confirmation, are a more diverse group, but there is no indication any share Mr. Trump\u2019s stated opposition to raising interest rates.\u201cIn most areas of administrative policy that have been highly politicized, his appointments have privileged politics over competence,\u201d Mr. Conti-Brown said. \u201cThe Fed has been an exception.\u201dA looming question, he said, is whether Mr. Trump might begin to match his actions to his words.Advertisement"}

It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L.

{"Headline": "New U.N. Climate Report Says Put a High Price on Carbon", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byScientists who worked on the United Nations report hailed Professor Nordhaus\u2019s work as influential for thinking about how to tackle climate change.\u201cIt\u2019s great to see the importance of Bill\u2019s work being recognized,\u201d said Drew Shindell, a climate scientist at Duke University and an author of the report. \u201cThough many think a price on carbon is too expensive, it\u2019s really a way of getting the true impacts of emissions into the economy so we can make better decisions.\u201dEconomists have long been enthusiastic about carbon pricing because of the policy\u2019s efficiency. Give companies a financial incentive to reduce their fossil-fuel use, and they will find creative and cost-effective ways to do so without the need for heavy-handed government regulations.To date, however, policymakers have often had more success in reducing emissions by relying on those heavy-handed government regulations. Examples include France\u2019s state-led push to build nuclear power in the 1970s and 1980s and the United States\u2019 strict fuel-economy standards for cars and light trucks, which have reduced domestic oil consumption by billions of barrels.\u201cIt is safe to say that policies other than carbon pricing have driven the majority of emissions reductions to date,\u201d said Jesse Jenkins, a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard\u2019s John F. Kennedy School of Government.A case in point: In 2012, the Australian government enacted a cap-and-trade program that effectively set a price on carbon of $23 per ton. Emissions fell nationwide under the program. Yet the policy faced a fierce political backlash from industry groups and voters, and when the nation\u2019s more conservative Liberal Party swept into power in 2013, it quickly moved to repeal the program.For comparison, the United Nations report estimated that governments would need to impose effective carbon prices of $135 to $5,500 per ton of carbon dioxide pollution by 2030 to keep overall global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit.Some scientists hope that the new United Nations report on the dangers of further climate change may spur nations to step up efforts like these. \u201cIf the report works and governments take it seriously, it should increase their ambition for expeditiously reducing emissions,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a climate scientist at Princeton.But getting anywhere near the high levels of carbon pricing envisioned by the report may take creative new strategies, said Mr. Jenkins, the researcher at Harvard. In the short term, policies that are widely popular with voters, such as mandates for renewable energy, can help reshape the political landscape to make more ambitious climate action feasible. And policies that spur innovation and drive down the cost of cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels, such as electric vehicles, could potentially make higher carbon prices more palatable. But whether they ultimately rely on carbon pricing, direct subsidies for clean energy or other types of policies, nations will have to do far more than they are currently doing for the world to have hope of avoiding drastic climate change.Coral Davenport contributed reporting from Incheon, South Korea.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "FIFA Says Saudi State Funds Won\u2019t Pay for New Tournaments", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKIGALI, Rwanda \u2014 FIFA moved to quell months of speculation that Saudi Arabia would invest billions in two new soccer tournaments by writing to its board to say that any possible deal will not include cash from state-owned investment funds.The claim is detailed in a lengthy document sent to members of FIFA\u2019s governing council before a key meeting here on Friday. Gianni Infantino \u2014 amid opposition from European soccer leaders \u2014 will ask members to back his contentious plans for a World Cup for clubs and a new league for nations.The meeting could be explosive, with European officials threatening to walk out before a vote can be taken. Infantino angered many in the game by asking the FIFA Council to allow him to make a multibillion-dollar agreement with a fund whose identity he declined to identify. They refused his request, demanding more information.Since then, The New York Times has obtained documents that show the offer was made by a Japanese conglomerate, SoftBank, a company that has partnered with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates to create the world\u2019s largest technology investment fund. The offer came as Saudi Arabia moved to invest in sports as part of a plan to diversify its economy beyond oil. Saudi sports officials have declined to say whether they are part of the offer to FIFA, and SoftBank has not commented.Infantino has been particularly focused on Saudi Arabia over the past year, visiting three times. He also met with the kingdom\u2019s de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman.\u201cFIFA would not enter into a joint venture for this purpose whether directly or indirectly with sovereign wealth fund of individual states,\u201d FIFA said in a consultation paper.In recent weeks the organization has also been privately saying that the links between the SoftBank-led offer and Saudi Arabia are not as strong as has been reported. That effort has grown since grisly details emerged about the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the country\u2019s consulate in Turkey earlier this month.FIFA did not say who is financing the offer, though officials had privately said as long ago as April that it was backed by Middle Eastern, Chinese and American money.Infantino declined to rule out Saudi investment when he met with reporters in June. \u201cWhoever invests in sport generally I think is welcome provided we do the things in an appropriate way,\u201d he said.Finances are just one part of the problem. Soccer politics is also writ large over the discussions.While FIFA owns the World Cup, UEFA is considerably richer thanks to its control of the Champions League. UEFA collects $15 billion in revenue over a four-year cycle, or almost three times what FIFA brings in during the same time.A new Club World Cup and the national-team league could be a major improvement on FIFA\u2019s other men\u2019s events outside of the World Cup. Under the proposals, the little-loved Confederations Cup, a World Cup warm up, would be scrapped, as would the current Club World Cup, an annual tournament in December.At Friday\u2019s meeting, council members will be asked to choose between two options for the new Club World Cup, should they agree to scrap the current tournament. One is the plan for an expanded quadrennial event, and another is for it to be played annually during the summer.Advertisement"}

Its 7,857 square feet include five bedrooms and six full bathrooms. All of the rooms have oversized windows, and the living room, in the back of the house, opens on three sides to outdoor spaces with the same Mexican tile and mahogany finishes found inside.A walkway cuts a path through the center of the backyard to a large lap pool, a brick barbecue and a palapa, or thatched structure, overlooking the ocean.\u201cThe views are amazing,\u201d said Luis Gonzalez, an agent with Holden Sotheby\u2019s International Realty in Cabarete, one of the property\u2019s listing brokers. \u201cYou get great views of the ocean and the rocks below the cliff.\u201dThe owners, a family from California, have used it as a vacation home for the last five years, Mr. Gonzalez said. They are including all furnishings in the sale.The gated estate is entered via a stone driveway with a covered, two-car carport on one side. A large wooden door opens to an entry hall that stretches back to the yard and tropical gardens behind the house. To the right of the hall is a den that could be used as a TV room or library; to the left is a formal dining room that opens to a chef\u2019s kitchen with granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances. At the end of the hall is the living room, anchored by an ornate iron chandelier, with large sliding doors that open to covered patios on two sides and the backyard in the rear. Although the living area is on one main level, soaring beamed ceilings throughout \u2014 reaching as high as 35 feet in some places \u2014 offer additional mezzanine space. Two of the guest suites have sizable sleeping lofts, and a small stairway off the kitchen leads up to the staff quarters.The en suite bedrooms are in a separate wing of the house and include a large master suite with a seating area, a marble bath with a whirlpool tub, and a covered terrace. In all, there are two king and nine queen beds in the house, making it well suited for large gatherings. The 250-acre Sea Horse Ranch resort offers numerous amenities, including tennis courts, an equestrian center, pools, a beach club and beach access. It is just outside the town of Cabarete in the Puerto Plata province (population around 330,000), about 19 miles from the city of Puerto Plata and a short drive from Isabel de Torres National Park. It is seven miles from Gregorio Luper\u00f3n International Airport and about 140 miles north of Santo Domingo, the capital city on the southern coast.Although the Dominican Republic\u2019s housing market slowed after the 2008 global financial crisis, \u201cit never fell as much as other parts of the Caribbean and the world,\u201d said William Holden, the broker-owner of Holden Sotheby\u2019s International Realty.In the years since, he said, the market has been \u201con a slow uptrend,\u201d thanks to a stable economy and an increase in tourism. Popular tourist spots along the southern and eastern coasts, like Casa de Campo and Punta Cana, have seen more growth than those on the northern coast, where there are fewer international flights and tourist attractions, real estate agents said.Mr. Holden estimated that sales volume in the northern region is up around 2 percent from last year, although he and others said that prices have remained level. Luxury properties in the Cabarete area typically start at about $200,000 for an older, two- or three-bedroom condominium farther from the water, agents said, while oceanfront homes in newer luxury developments, like Sea Horse Ranch, sell for at least $700,000.Several new oceanfront luxury condominiums have been built in the last decade, Mr. Holden said, with unit prices ranging from $500,000 to $2 million.Americans and Canadians looking for vacation or retirement homes make up a large portion of the foreign buyers in the Dominican Republic, real estate professionals said, noting that there is also strong interest from Europeans, particularly those in France, Italy, Spain and Germany.Mr. Holden said he has also seen a growing number of Russian buyers, as well as a recent influx of Venezuelans. \u201cIt\u2019s very stable politically, and property rights are very secure,\u201d he said of the Dominican Republic.Buyers on the northern coast are typically drawn to the miles of sandy and rocky beaches, as well as the excellent surfing and sailing, particularly in Cabarete.Other buyers are lured by the diverse terrain. \u201cIn the north coast we have mountains, and rivers where you can go rafting,\u201d Ms. Mertes-Urbahn said. \u201cThe area is also famous for surfing. And there\u2019s snorkeling. It\u2019s more diverse here.\u201dThere are generally no restrictions on foreign ownership of property in the Dominican Republic.Local financing is available, but usually at less attractive terms than many buyers could get at home, Mr. Suero said, so most international buyers pay in cash or obtain loans elsewhere.Although it is not required, buyers are advised to hire an experienced local lawyer to represent them during the transaction, which usually takes around 45 days. The lawyer will oversee due diligence on the property, Mr. Suero said, arranging for a title search and appraisal, among other things. Legal fees are usually 1 to 2 percent of the sale price of a property, although they are negotiable.Closing documents must be notarized. Notaries, who are required to have a law degree, charge a nonnegotiable fee based on the property\u2019s value.Spanish; Dominican peso (1 Dominican peso = $0.02)Sellers typically pay the real estate agent\u2019s commission, which ranges from 4 to 8 percent of the sale price. Buyers are responsible for a number of closing costs, including a transfer and stamp tax.The annual property taxes on this home are $7,000, Mr. Gonzalez said, and monthly homeowner association fees, which cover common-area maintenance, security and garbage collection, are $755.Advertisement"}

Here are a few excerpts (click on the commenter\u2019s name to read the rest of the story):Hiding\u201cI really don\u2019t want to live here\u201d I said as My mom and I pulled up to the driveway. \u201cIts the only place we can hide from your brother.\u201d Mom said.As we walked into the old creaky house I got a chill. The chandelier was cracked and the metal chains holding it on the roof were rusted. the wooden stairway was super soggy and was falling apart.\u201cIts almost midnight you should go to bed\u201d Mom Said. \u201cYeah sure\u201d. \u201cGoodnight.\u201d \u201cGoodnight Mom.\u201dAs I started to crawl into the dirty bed I started to hear something. \u201cget out.\u201d The voice cut out. \u201cGEt out!\u201d \u201cHello!?\u201d I screamed. \u201cGET OUT!\u201d As i heard banging and felt rumbles coming up the stairs. As an omonious figure stood in the doorway it was too dark to see what it was. \u201cWho are yo-\u201d As the monster bolted towards me wielding a shovel. \u201cGET OUT OF MY HOUSE!\u201dVirtual realityThe leaves on the bent and broken branches shivered in the breeze. the chill was uncanny, like tentacles of ice gripping my legs, and wrapping around my chest, before engulfing me whole. I shivered as I watched my flashlight fade away, like a sunset, but terrifying. The leaves underneath my feet crackle like gunshots, growing louder and louder, shaking my feet with every step. The house before me looms like a grave, darker than death. The windows caked in dust, form eyes and flash out at me in the gloom. The sound of cackling crows floats through the air, before being whisked away in the wind. Laughter echoed from the house, not scary laughter, but musical laughter, welcoming laughter. Then the sound of the lunch bell rang, and I took of the VR headset before heading back to class.The LittletonsDown past Walker street, and around the corner, there is a decrepit house in such a state of disrepair, that there is no hope of it ever being restored. I have heard rumors of ghosts, werewolves, and zombies, that come to life at night. But secretly, I know that is not true, because this house was once a place of laughter and joy.In this long life of mine, I once knew the owners of the house. They were the Littletons; the three of them. There was Papa, Mama, and Sophie the little girl. They must have been the happiest family in the neighborhood. But as all things come to pass, their happiness left them one morning. Mama and Sophie were busy picking flowers, when they heard a terrible scream.Silhouette in the doorwayCrack, crack, crack. The leaves crunch under my feet as I walk towards the old house. It is towering over me, casting a looming shadow. The siding is rotting away and the windows are shattered. A sickly green mist hangs where the garden once was. My heart begins to pound, what lies beyond that crumbling fence? Owls hoot in the distance, I jump quickly turning around to see that no one is there. With my hands quivering I slowly grasp the door handle, the door swings open, creaking and moaning. A silhouette is illuminated in the doorway. My scream echoes in the darkness, never to be heard again.You\u2019re nextThe old white houseSpooky season__________Teenagers were divided in their response, but all gave compelling reasons for why they believe marijuana should and should not be decriminalized.Legalize itI believe that marijuana should be legal. Marijuana should be legal because the purpose of government is to enact laws that protect citizens from harm, while still allowing them personal freedoms and liberties. The government\u2019s job is not to babysit citizens and tell them what is bad for them or good for them. In a free and democratic society, citizens should have the right to make decisions for themselves regardless of whether the consequences of the decision are negative or positive, as long as the decision doesn\u2019t endanger the public.For example, a citizen should be able to gamble away all of his money if he sees it fit to do so. Although it is clear that this is not a good thing, this citizen\u2019s money belongs to him, and spending it doesn\u2019t hurt anyone but himself, so he should be allowed to do what he chooses with it, regardless of whether his choices were negative or positive.This same logic applies to the legalization of marijuana. If a person decides to use marijuana, they consciously made the choice to do so using their own free will, and will have to deal with the outcomes of their choice. Using marijuana is not linked to violence, except for the odd murder of a bag of chips, so there is no danger posed to society from someone using it. Therefore, it is clear that marijuana should be legalized based on the duty of the government to allow citizens to exercise their freedoms.Yes, marijuana should be legal. One reason is for medical purposes. Marijuana can help treat/cure so many diseases or disorders that cannot be treated by anything else. There are also forms of marijuana that do not even give the effects of a high, like CBD oils, that are only used for medical treatments. For this reason, it really confuses me how marijuana isn\u2019t already legal everywhere when it helps so many people.However, I also believe marijuana should be legal for recreational use. Marijuana has less adverse health effects than alcohol does, and alcohol is fully legal for recreational use. Nobody has ever overdosed on marijuana, people die from alcohol poisoning often. People are also less likely to do reckless things while under the influence of marijuana than alcohol.I think legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada will be a huge success. This is going to bring a large amount of tax revenue that is being lost because of the black market. Legalization of marijuana is also going to increase the number of possible jobs. I hope to see recreational marijuana legalized in the United States soon.I believe the current federal prohibition on marijuana does more harm then good. Some states have already legalized marijuana (Alaska, California, Colorado, and Massachusetts are just a few), but thousands of people are getting incarcerated for possessing this drug that is a lot less harmful than legally sold tobacco or alcohol \u2026 I think there is no doubt that legalization of marijuana will aid the countries economic growth, but I do believe it would be possible for it to decrease drug violence as people now would not have to but it off of the streets.I think It should be legal so it can be regulated. Though it is currently illegal people are still using it, therefore it is being used in a unregulated way. If it was legal people could be protected. Also, marijuana is not a dangerous drug because there isn\u2019t an addictive component in it. Keeping it illegal hasn\u2019t stopped people from using it so that isn\u2019t doing anything. A new approach needs to be taken.Continue prohibitionI believe that legalizing cannabis for recreational use is not a social good. Yes, it is good in the fact that with legalization of cannabis, it will be government controlled, and so maybe safer \u2026But even knowing this, marijuana is still not the safest. In the article,\u201d Is Marijuana Safe?\u201d by Stephanie Watson, she says that \u201c Marijuana smoke is also filled with many of the same chemicals as tobacco smoke, some of which are known to cause cancer.\u201d The same article makes it known that with the consumption of enough cannabis, it is possible to overdose. There are far more negative health effects than positive with recreational use of marijuana, instead of being limited to medication.I think there are a variety of dangers for the legalization of marijuana. Although I think that it is a huge benefit that legal marijuana is screened so that it is not laced with other dangerous drugs, I think that much of society will become a giant population of \u201cstoners\u201d. I think that the legalization of marijuana will lead to a huge drug crisis. Once people get sick of the effects of marijuana, it will lead to the addictions of more major drugs.Drinking while driving is already a huge problem and driving while high will definitely become a large problem if it is made legal. That will cause traffic accidents by the driver\u2019s lack of awareness. If many people are high all the time, it will increase the rate of unproductive workers which will eventually affect the economy, poverty, and unemployment rates in a negative manner. Making it legal will allow young people to get their hands on marijuana much easier which may lower educational achievement and worsen family problems.I do not think that the government should legalize marijuna because the kids that are using it could be lead to do other, more dangerous drugs; that is why it is called the gateway drug.__________From artistic ventures \u2014 like music, cooking, drawing, photography and writing \u2014 to practical ones \u2014 like Mock Trial, sports, activism and child care \u2014 students wrote excitedly about the things that bring them joy.Finding time for the things you loveWith the pressure of schoolwork, and the stress of commitments to go along with it, it is a mental release to be able to go and do something you love at the end of the day. Mock Trial is one of these releases for me. In Mock Trial, students get to practice the skills of being a lawyer, and compete in competition against other teams, and it is something that I look forward to doing every Tuesday. Especially when so much of school is based around obtaining a good grade, it is so motivating to be able to go to an activity that you love at the end of a school day.At the end of the day my all time favorite thing to do is to go walking. I would have to say that being outside is something that I look forward to on a daily basis. I live on a hill and in front of a pond it is the most beautiful thing you will ever see. Walking outside and seeing the the pond and then the valleys and the mountain in the background it is breath taking. It is super calming to be able to be a part of nature.A large part of my life that I believe is a true passion of mine is music. I have in every way tried becoming as involved in the music programs offered from elementary school up to high school now. Some may see it as stressful, with the amount of sports, ap courses and other hobbies that I do. With chorus and band on top of it all, it would seem to others as overwhelming. The large thing with music is that it doesn\u2019t feel stressful. No matter if I have a busy day with a ton of homework, or a big meet for cross country later in the day. When I sit down to sing or play my flute, all the stress of the day seems to go away.Turning passion into a future careerMy passion is cosmetology. The idea of beautifying people is fun. I am a senior in high school and I go to beauty school. I look forward to practicing my profession everyday. To satisfy people and make them feel good about their appearance is what I want to do for the rest of my life. I believe everyone should have a passion that they do everyday in order to be happy with their self.Ever since I was little, I have loved to help everyone around me. Whether it be volunteering at a soup kitchen or taking care of sick animals, I love making sure others are happy and well. I always knew that I wanted to devote my life to the good of society, so I decided that becoming a veterinarian would be the perfect solution, as I absolutely adore animals. I am eager to spend my days caring for others by keeping beloved pets healthy. Spreading kindness and helping others not only benefits society, but fulfills me and makes me a better person. I have been pursuing my passion of helping animals by working at an animal clinic, and I\u2019m so happy because of it.My passion is filmmaking and I want directing to be my career. Sometimes I feel like school should allow more time for people to explore their dreams and talents. As students complete high school, they have all been taught pretty much the same material, leaving limited space for creative exploration and individual freedom. Self expression is at the heart of what will make people positive, unique members of society. Yet schools give kids few chances to truly discover themselves \u2026It\u2019s hard not to feel discouraged under a barrage of school work, college anxiety, social uncertainty, and general adolescent chaos. High school stress often feels exaggerated by headlines as a special kind of hell but there is truth to the mania. High schools should channel more energy into helping kids focus on their careers. After all, we spend more of our lives at jobs than at school. Education should reflect that.Things that get in the wayI have many passions, and they all vary...Sometimes, I think I over involve myself. Because I participate in time consuming activities, I don\u2019t always have the chance to make time for my friends or my family. It also prevents me from trying new things. I got interested in roller derby earlier this year but was talked out of it because it would ruin my legs for cross country. All of new things I want to try have to be filtered through my schedule, how it would affect me, and probably a coach. Overall, though, I\u2019m appreciative I have the opportunity to participate in activities like these, and the sense of purpose they give me.My passion is dancing, which i\u2019ve been doing since the age of 5 \u2026 .Although dancing makes me feel happy, this happiness isn\u2019t always the case. School, mostly, gets in the way of me pursuing my passion. Yes I go to dance classes weekly but I\u2019m always being left with the burden of having to stay up late doing homework. Schools should assign less or no homework because I feel like students need time to explore what they like to do and what they want to do in their future lives. Schools should even offer programs with different types of activities so students can better themselves in their passions or future careers.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Economic Anxiety Didn\u2019t Elect Trump and It May Hurt His Party in the Midterms", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president is less popular than overall growth would predict.Mr. Griffin and Mr. Sides just completed a study of economic distress levels and voting patterns. The 2016 election is almost two years behind us, but arguments over why Donald Trump won haven\u2019t stopped. Because Mr. Trump drew support from white voters with less formal education \u2014 the \u201cwhite working class\u201d \u2014 many attributed his victory to Americans\u2019 economic anxiety.But this narrative has obscured the true nature of Mr. Trump\u2019s coalition. On the whole, Trump voters were never extraordinarily economically distressed. And now the economically distressed are actually less likely to approve of Mr. Trump\u2019s performance as president.Traditional ways of measuring people\u2019s views of the economy often suffer from partisan bias: People are more likely to say that the economy is doing better when their party controls the White House. For example, immediately after Mr. Trump\u2019s election, and well before he could do anything to affect the economy, the percentage of Republicans who said the economy was getting better increased from 15 percent in October 2016 to 80 percent in February 2017, according to Gallup polls. Over the same time period, Democrats became less favorable about the economy.The results showed that minorities of Americans reported an acute economic struggle in the previous year. Eight percent said they or their spouse had lost a job. The percentage who had difficulty making a payment for their mortgage or other major expenses ranged between 7 and 14 percent.A larger fraction expressed concern about their economic situation. About one in five were somewhat or very dissatisfied with their income and 25 percent reported a drop in their income in the previous year. Savings were a real concern: 33 percent said that they did not have any savings and 40 percent were dissatisfied with their savings. Nearly half (47 percent) said that they were not very or not at all financially prepared for the unexpected.Who was especially likely to report economic distress? To answer this, we combined these 14 questions into an overall index that ranges from 0-100, where 100 indicates the most distress. The average in this survey was 29. Among the white working class voters that featured in so much election commentary, the average was also 29, which suggested more distress than whites with a college degree, who averaged 23.But focusing on the white working class obscures the true contours of economic distress. In reality, it is people of color who report the most distress \u2014 a fact that is not surprising but stands out clearly in the new data. Hispanic-Americans without a college degree averaged 37 on this index and African-Americans without a college degree averaged 32. In fact, African-Americans with a college degree reported slightly more distress (30, on average) than whites without a college degree.This pattern was evident at every income level. Nonwhites with the same household income as whites still reported more economic distress. This was true even when comparing nonwhites with college degrees to whites without college degrees.What about Trump voters overall? They actually reported less economic distress than those who voted for Hillary Clinton \u2014 and again this was true at every income level. Moreover, Mr. Trump\u2019s earliest supporters, those who voted for him in the primary, reported less distress than did the primary supporters of either Mrs. Clinton or Bernie Sanders. Similarly, the much-discussed \u201cObama-Trump voter\u201d did not report distinctively high levels of economic distress.If anything, economic distress is now a drag on Mr. Trump\u2019s support. Republicans who reported high levels of distress were 10 percentage points less likely to approve of Mr. Trump, compared with those with low levels of distress. Among independents, economic distress was associated with a steeper 17-point drop in approval. In other words, economic distress is doing what it typically does in American politics: serve as a referendum on the incumbent president.This matters a great deal for the upcoming midterm election: whether Americans vote for congressional candidates in the president\u2019s party depends on the president\u2019s popularity. So the economically distressed Americans who disapprove of Mr. Trump could very well punish his party in November.Advertisement"}

Often these trucks have been parked on the highways overnight.Cars and minivans snake along the remaining single lane, sharing it with pedestrians fighting off early-morning road rage as they slowly make their way from one end of the city to another. There is a palpable fear of accidents, or a spill. Much of Lagos is an environmental disaster waiting to happen.\u201cThe failure to produce refined products over the last 25 years has created a huge architecture of graft and corruption around everything,\u201d said Antony Goldman, the co-founder of the London-based Nigeria specialists ProMedia Consulting.\u201cA refinery that actually works and can meet Nigeria\u2019s refined product requirement? It\u2019s a game changer,\u201d Mr. Goldman added. But change, no matter how positive, is potentially destabilizing. \u201cThese are not people who relinquish things without a fight,\u201d Mr. Goldman said of Nigeria\u2019s fuel import merchants.\u201cThis refinery is attacking the entire system,\u201d he said. \u201cYou export jobs and create poverty here, so that\u2019s what we are stopping,\u201d he told reporters at the time.Despite creating thousands of jobs, Mr. Dangote\u2019s refinery hasn\u2019t been universally applauded in Nigeria. The biggest issue is its Lagos location: The refinery is being built hundreds of miles from the impoverished Niger Delta, where the bulk of Nigeria\u2019s oil is extracted.Two undersea pipelines are under construction in the Delta and will carry petroleum about 340 miles to the refinery in Lagos.Yet critics \u2014 and Mr. Dangote has many \u2014 worry that his new refinery will allow him to essentially take over the Nigeria\u2019s oil and gas industry. Why would a nation leave an entire industry in the hands of one company? they ask.And for some in a tough business environment like Nigeria, a well-run monopoly is better than the current situation, where getting fuel remains an uncertainty. Indeed, despite oligarchy concerns, Mr. Goldman says he believes that Mr. Dangote\u2019s past success actually bodes well for the refinery and Nigeria. \u201cHe has a record of success and delivery, and he doesn\u2019t make mistakes on things like this,\u201d Mr. Goldman said.And Nigerians are tired of power cuts and overpriced gasoline.\u201cMost Nigerians see Aliko as a doer,\u201d Mr. Ogunbunmi, the publisher, said. \u201cMany quietly hope the refinery will help reduce uncertainties. Gasoline will be available, and possibly power.\u201dBeyond solidifying his own legacy, Mr. Dangote hopes his refinery will help diversify Nigeria\u2019s economy while reducing its dependence on imported oil.Edozien is the author of the book \u201cLives of Great Men,\u201d a 2018 Lambda Literary Award winner and is director of the Reporting Africa program at New York University\u2019s Arthur L.

Yet one of the biggest challenges facing the world is the polarized debate over the future of energy.

Oil and gas will meet about half of that demand; a prediction that holds firm even in the most aggressive low-carbon scenario.The world needs a wide range of energy sources to accommodate growing demand while reducing energy poverty.

We shouldn\u2019t expect universal solutions to unique challenges. What\u2019s happening in London or Boston isn\u2019t necessarily the answer for Beijing or New Delhi. The recognition that the global energy system is complex. Providing reliable, affordable and ever-cleaner energy to a growing population requires massive investment and innovation \u2014 and a rational policy environment. An agreement that cleaner solutions are required, but they must also be reliable and affordable. The realization that meeting the world\u2019s energy needs will require a diverse mix of sources. This means embracing different forms of energy and looking for opportunities to scale cleaner energy faster.These principles can guide us toward a more productive conversation about energy. And they can help us unlock the benefit of reliable, affordable, ever-cleaner energy to power the world forward.Chief executive of PemexThe oil and gas industry is in an uncertain time, particularly when it comes to meeting growing demand. There is no doubt that the demand for energy will continue to increase at an accelerated rate, but experts continue to debate the sources of future energy. From my point of view, the world\u2019s main energy sources will continue to come from fossil fuels \u2014 mainly hydrocarbons, at least for the next 50 years.An element that makes this scenario more complex is that the industry must reach a balance between supplying the world\u2019s growing need for affordable energy, while at the same time meeting society\u2019s increasing demands and awareness of the environmental impact of fossil fuels.Energy demand can be divided into three segments: the developed countries that account for the largest share, but at the same time are the most aware regarding the impact of oil and gas on the planet; the developing countries that require significant investment to rapidly satisfy their demand for affordable energy while dealing with pressure to manage their natural reserves; and the least-developed nations that rely on few energy sources, yet have the most rapid increase in demand.Without doubt, environmental efforts by oil and gas companies should be an important component of their policies, values and principles. They should also be routinely evaluated as part of their investment decisions. Investment funds fully assess environmental, social and governance factors of corporate issuers in an integrated manner along with credit metrics, when undertaking any investment decision.One cleaner energy source that will play an important role in the industry is natural gas. Large nations like China and India have announced that they will use natural gas as their main energy source. The next step for the oil and gas industry is to make natural gas production as profitable and accessible as crude-oil production and to engage with the transportation industry to develop economically accessible technologies.The rest depends on making the switch from oil-driven to natural gas-driven economies, while maintaining the same levels of attractiveness for sources of funding.Global energy industry managing director of AccentureThe biggest challenge for the oil and gas industry will be navigating short- and long-term disruptions. Companies large and small must make their production businesses even more competitive, while simultaneously creating opportunities for material growth based on future demand.As the global industry recovers from the 2014 downturn \u2014 one of the deepest in memory \u2014 it is at a crucial inflection point. While decisive leadership and restructuring was needed to survive, few can be confident that they transformed sufficiently to thrive in the cycles ahead.The industry is holding its breath to see where cost savings can be sustained as prices and activity levels rise. At the same time, major companies now understand that the fundamental changes, required to capture the full value of digital technologies, still need to be made. This will require a shift from simple deployment to more wholesale transformation.Crucially, now is the time to address the gradual but relentless disruption that continues to change the balance of supply and demand. Industries we serve \u2014 power, transportation and materials manufacture \u2014 are being disrupted by new technologies, regulations and customer behaviors. Having spent decades obsessed with finding new sources of supply, we must now enhance the understanding and expertise that\u2019s focused on capturing demand.There are any number of strategies to navigate these uncertainties. Transforming core operations to maximize investment capacity is crucial, as is setting intelligent strategies for the future. Additionally, companies must ensure that investment capacity is allocated deliberately between these core and new business options. This will require a wise pivot by the oil and gas industry, balancing capital, capability and risk allocation to create options for sustained success.Indeed, oil and gas companies may find themselves spearheading a new petrochemical revolution; competing head-to-head with utilities in efficient, highly distributed power generation; or even creating new ways for consumers to access and use energy.The industry\u2019s future will be volatile and highly uncertain. Companies that survive and, ultimately, thrive have no time to waste. In an industry where demand is set to become the scarcer commodity \u2014 particularly in mature markets \u2014 an intimate understanding of unmet customer needs could just be the most potent \u201cproven reserves\u201d of the future.Chairman, president and chief executive of Air ProductsThe industrial gas industry must continue to evolve and create innovative solutions that benefit the environment, enhance sustainability and address obstacles facing customers, communities and the world. This is the challenge everyone operating in the oil and gas industry faces today, and tomorrow.Working together we must find solutions to address the bottom-of-the-barrel oil issue and be able to do so in an environmentally sound manner. Gasification technology is one option to create beneficial uses for these bottom-of-the-barrel oils in a more sustainable manner. This is something that Air Products is already heavily investing in.The core of how we approach business, now and in the future, must be sustainable operating practices. Strong goals and public sentiments may set the baseline for a company\u2019s intent, but the genuine proof of a commitment to sustainability is demonstrated by results. We need to work with our customers, our suppliers and other key stakeholders to ensure an appropriate level of energy and focus continue to drive innovative technologies that will deliver efficiencies and improve the way products are produced.Together, we have an obligation to protect and preserve our world for future generations.President of petroleum operations of BHPOil price uncertainty and volatility is one of the biggest challenges facing our industry. Oil markets have always been exposed to boom and bust cycles, but the frequency and magnitude of price cycles may be more acute in the future.Oil markets have tightened, spare capacity has declined, and geopolitical tensions are rising, all of which could cause oil prices to spike in the near term. On the other hand, despite tightening credit markets, capital remains relatively available and inexpensive, and unconventional participants in markets in the United States are quite agile.Adding to the uncertainty are these conflicting scenarios: If prices rise rapidly, low barriers to entry and the very high number of onshore players in the United States could cause cost inflation. Meantime, new production encouraged by a surge of capital and activity will likely cause oversupply and depress prices. Physical oil export constraints in the Permian Basin in Texas will likely restrain near-term production growth rates, but growth in inventories of wells drilled and completed but not producing to their full capacity, and oil price hedging, could exacerbate a downturn once export capacity bottlenecks are removed.To address oil price uncertainty and volatility challenges, companies will need to set their priorities using thorough market analysis and scenario planning. At BHP, we\u2019re building a pipeline of options that are robust across the range. We have a preference for investment and operational oversight at early stages of access and exploration, as this affords us maximum flexibility to adjust to changes including market conditions.An earlier version of this article misstated the title of Andrew Smart of Accenture.

{"Headline": "Stocks Plunge, as Fresh Tensions With China Batter Tech Shares", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStocks suffered their steepest drop in eight months on Wednesday, as rising interest rates gnawed at investors and as previously high-flying technology shares tumbled in the face of growing tensions with China.The decline signaled a change in mood on Wall Street. For months, it had seemed as though nothing could spook stock investors in the United States. Growing corporate profits and surging shares of technology giants pushed major benchmarks to a string of record highs.But concerns about nascent inflation, rising interest rates and the potential for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy came together into a wave of selling Wednesday. In addition, President Trump\u2019s policies toward Beijing have become a drag on technology companies, which rely heavily on China as a manufacturing base. Shares of the companies that make components like semiconductors have been particularly hard hit in the recent selling. Apple shares, for example, slid over 4.5 percent on Wednesday.\u201cIt looks as though Trump is settling most of the trade skirmishes around the world that he started earlier this year with one important exception,\u201d said Ed Yardeni, president of the stock market research firm Yardeni Research. \u201cIt looks like China is going to be a long-term issue.\u201dThough the S.&P. has fallen from its most recent peaks in January and September, it is still up more than 20 percent since President Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017.+30%Percentage changein the S.&P. 500-stock index \u2026+25+20\u2026 Since Trump\u2019sinauguration:+20.5%+15+10+5\u2026 Since the market\u2019s previouspeak on Jan. 26: \u20135.0%0Inauguration\u20135Correctionterritory\u201310\u2026 Since themarket\u2019s peakon Sept. 20: \u20136.9%\u20131520172018+30%+25Percentage change in theS.&P. 500-stock index \u2026+20\u2026 Since Trump\u2019sinauguration:+20.5%+15+10+5\u2026 Since the market\u2019s previouspeak on Jan. 26: \u20135.0%0Inauguration\u20135Correction territory\u2026 Since themarket\u2019s peakon Sept. 20: \u20136.9%\u201310\u20131520172018Source: Refinitiv | By The New York TimesRising interest rates are something of a double-edged sword. They reflect the strength of the American economy, where unemployment is at 49-year lows, but they also mean borrowers looking to buy a home or a car, or invest in a business, will have to pay more to do so. Conventional 30-year mortgage rates are about 5 percent, for example, hurting both home affordability and the share price of home builders.\u201cStock markets like rising interest rates because they tend to signal a strong economic backdrop,\u201d said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist for Credit Suisse. \u201cThat said, stock markets do not like very abrupt, large moves.\u201dPresident Trump, who has boasted about the stock market rally as shares climbed, took Wednesday\u2019s sell-off as an opportunity to criticize the Federal Reserve, which has also been raising the short-term interest rates under its control. Mr. Trump had previously expressed his displeasure with that policy.\u201cThe Fed is making a mistake,\u201d he said when asked by reporters about the market drop, shortly after landing in Erie, Pa., before a campaign rally. \u201cI think the Fed has gone crazy.\u201d He described the recent selling as \u201ca correction that we\u2019ve been waiting for, for a long time.\u201dBut some policies put into place under Mr. Trump, like tax cuts and increased government spending that have widened the federal deficit, are also a factor in the rise in borrowing costs.The worsening tensions between the Trump administration and China also drew blame for the drop on Wednesday.Earlier in the day, the Treasury Department imposed new rules making it easier to block foreign investment in technology companies on national security grounds, outlining a rigorous review system that is aimed primarily at preventing China from gaining access to sensitive American technology.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.\u201cThere\u2019s an increasing realization in the market that this is not just about the trade deficit. This is about security concerns. This is about geopolitical strength,\u201d said Evan Brown, director of asset allocation at UBS Asset Management. \u201cIt\u2019s about encouraging U.S. companies to move their supply chains out of China. And so there are questions about a broader disruption and potential legislation or scrutiny in these markets.\u201dDespite the tumble on Wednesday, many market observers expect strong third-quarter earnings will be enough to help stocks recover their recent losses. Those reports will start to flow in earnest this Friday, when some of the largest United States banks, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, will post results.Thanks to the strength of the economy and steep cuts in corporate tax rates, corporate earnings are expected to rise more than 20 percent from the third quarter of 2017, according to John Butters, an earnings analyst with FactSet. That would be the third consecutive quarter of earnings growth of more than 20 percent.But that outlook isn\u2019t without risks. As the economy heats up, costs are climbing and starting to eat into relatively fat profit margins.On Wednesday, Fastenal, a company that makes products like industrial supplies used on factory floors, reported better-than-expected profit and sales numbers. But its profit margin was something of a disappointment and the stock fell more than 7 percent.\u201cWe are starting to see some margin pressure from higher raw materials and energy and labor costs,\u201d said Savita Subramanian, equity strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Still, she stressed that strong economic demand should support corporate profits, even if margins contract.That\u2019s one reason she thinks the stock market remains an attractive place for investors, even with rising inflation and interest rates.\u201cI would stick with equities for the time being,\u201d she said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lindsey Graham Welcomed Trump\u2019s China Tariffs, Then Helped Companies Avoid Them", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has been one of the biggest proponents of President Trump\u2019s crackdown on China, welcoming tariffs on Chinese imports while conceding that they will raise costs for American businesses and consumers.But behind the scenes, Mr. Graham has been working to help chemical and textile companies in his home state avoid the pain of Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war. The senator has advocated on behalf of seven South Carolina companies that import products from China, writing letters urging the Trump administration to remove materials they rely on from a list of goods subject to Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs.Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs, Mr. Graham told the administration, could \u201ceconomically harm consumers and stifle economic growth in South Carolina.\u201dThe senator has written seven letters to the United States trade representative on behalf of companies seeking tariff relief \u2014 more than any other member of Congress has penned. Four of those seven received at least some of the relief they were seeking.The jockeying to protect South Carolina companies highlights the tension inherent in Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war, which is aimed at punishing China with tariffs on $250 billion worth of goods but is hurting many American companies in the process. Businesses across the United States have grown by embracing the global economy \u2014 producing, selling and buying goods from countries across the world, including China. As Mr. Trump threatens to impose even more tariffs on Chinese imports, many companies are appealing to the administration for relief \u2014 creating winners and losers in the process.Among the companies appealing to the trade representative were seven firms with operations in South Carolina, including Mitsubishi Chemical America, Standard Textile and paper manufacturer Archroma.In September, Mr. Graham wrote letters to Robert E. Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, on behalf of those firms, arguing that the tariffs would cause irreparable harm to domestic companies.\u201cChina\u2019s behavior has unjustifiably burdened and restricted U.S. commerce and I am encouraged by President Trump\u2019s attention to this important issue,\u201d Mr. Graham wrote in each letter. \u201cHowever, stiff competition from global competitors forces domestic manufacturers to absorb the additional cost of a tariff. This could put South Carolina companies at a competitive disadvantage.\u201dMr. Graham went on to urge \u201ccareful consideration\u201d of a list of product codes that applied to each company, then said that imposing tariffs on them had \u201cthe potential to economically harm consumers and stifle economic growth in South Carolina.\u201d At the conclusion of each letter, he said that \u201cI appreciate your attention to these constituent requests and your continued efforts to combat China\u2019s unfair trade practices.\u201dAlso dropped from the list were three lines that affect Standard Textile, which has a plant in Union County, S.C. In 2017, the United States imported about $30 million worth of those three fabrics, $25 million of which went to South Carolina, according to Census Bureau data.The product lines that Mr. Graham specified \u2014 and were removed from the tariff list before it was finalized last month \u2014 account for more than $430 million of imports from China annually, according to federal data. That\u2019s about 6 percent of the total value of products removed from the final list.\u201cOnly a fool would not know that Lindsey Graham fights tooth and nail for business in South Carolina,\u201d Kevin Bishop, a spokesman for Mr. Graham, said in a email. \u201cHe takes great pride in standing up for working men and women in our state, and that\u2019s never going to stop.\u201dThe United States trade representative officials did not respond to questions about whether Mr. Graham\u2019s efforts influenced their decisions on the final list.The trade representative\u2019s records show that 40 members of Congress submitted formal comments over the proposed list of products for the most recent round of tariffs, which begin at 10 percent on $200 billion of imports, and are set to escalate to 25 percent next year. Most filed only one comment. None filed more than three, other than Mr. Graham.Representative Emmanuel Cleaver, Democrat of Missouri and a critic of Mr. Trump\u2019s China tariffs, wrote three letters urging changes to the most recent tariff list, including the removal of gift bags imported by Hallmark and cement products imported by Demdaco, a home d\u00e9cor company. Mr. Cleaver also asked the administration to include on the list a category of products that includes imported log splitters, which compete with splitters made by Blount International, which has a factory in Kansas City.Other Republican senators who sought changes to the tariff list include Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who joined a bipartisan letter on behalf of paper manufacturer Appvion; Jerry Moran and Pat Roberts of Kansas, who jointly advocated on behalf of Pitsco, a small Kansas company that sells model car kits and other materials for science and math education; and Roger Wicker of Mississippi, who expressed concern that any additional tariffs could hurt United Furniture Industries, a manufacturer headquartered in Tupelo, Miss.Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a former trade representative under President George W. Bush, sent a letter containing dozens of product codes that he said were drawn from \u201cOhio constituent entities that have weighed in with my office.\u201dMr. Portman has said that a tariff escalation with China \u201cis not good for us,\u201d but he has praised the administration for taking a hard line against Chinese trading practices. His letter asked that some of the product codes be added to the list and others subtracted.Mr. Portman did not name the companies, nor warn of any economic damage if his recommendations were not heeded. Twenty-five of the product lines that he requested be dropped were removed from the final list. Some of his suggestions overlapped with Mr. Graham\u2019s, including the textile lines requested for removal by Standard Textile, which is headquartered in Cincinnati.A critic of Mr. Trump when they were rivals for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2016 campaign, Mr. Graham has refashioned himself as one of the president\u2019s closest allies in the Senate, most recently with his impassioned defense of the president\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Brett M. Kavanaugh, against allegations of sexual assault.South Carolina\u2019s economy depends heavily on trade, but Mr. Graham has rarely wavered in his support for Mr. Trump\u2019s trade agenda \u2014 including the imposition of tariffs against China \u2014 in an effort to force Beijing to end a long list of trade practices that the administration says violate international rules.After Mr. Trump met in June with Republicans concerned over his trade policies, Mr. Graham released another statement.\u201cNow is not the time to undercut President Trump\u2019s ability to negotiate better trade deals,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not support any efforts that weaken his position.\u201dMr. Graham\u2019s letters were shorter than most of his colleagues\u2019, and they were nearly identical to one another, changing only the names of the company in question and the product codes that affect it.The companies Mr. Graham cited in his letters include multinationals that have set up operations in the United States. Archroma, which has a parent company headquartered in Switzerland, told administration officials in its own comment letter that tariffs on the chemicals it imports \u201cwill force Archroma to raise prices and customers will shift their purchases to foreign competition.\u201dMitsubishi Chemical America\u2019s president, Dennis Price, testified in August that tariffs on chemicals that are critical to its manufacturing of lithium ion batteries for electric cars would \u201cforce us to reconsider our investments in the United States and our plans to continue to grow our manufacturing footprint in this country.\u201dOne of the companies Mr. Graham advocated, Standard Textile, welcomed his efforts but a spokeswoman said it did not know if they had helped.\u201cStandard Textile and Senator Graham each filed comments with U.S.T.R. requesting that additional tariffs not be imposed on certain intermediate products imported by Standard Textile from China because these intermediate products are required to support manufacturing jobs in South Carolina,\u201d a spokeswoman for the company, Judy Sroufe, said in an email, referring to the trade representative. \u201cStandard Textile has no visibility into whether or not Senator Graham\u2019s letter influenced the decision by U.S.T.R.\u201dKeith Collins contributed reporting from New York.Advertisement"}

Whitfield, 69, was baptized in the 15-mile bayou that runs behind True Vine Missionary Baptist Church in 1964, but it took him 35 years to get back to this place where he was first made in the spirit. In the intervening time, he came of age, worked as a contractor, had daughters and sons, built two churches with his own hands and led them, and saw his sons join the ministry and lead their own congregations in other Delta towns.His return to his spiritual birthplace was not a matter of if, but rather when \u2014 18 years ago this month. Like the sanctuaries and daughters and sons and grandchildren, this church has been built up and steadied, under Pastor Whitfield\u2019s care ever since.We set out to document 24 different hours in 24 states, to shine a lens on the lives of people rarely in the headlines.

{"Headline": "Tulsa, Oklahoma, 10:02 P.M.", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "Documenting moments across the country, large and small, quiet and indelible.Supported byWhen this project was being conceived, a storm named Florence did not exist. It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L. Whitfield sermonized from the Gospel According to John. In one of the pews they built a dollhouse out of Bibles. Pastor Whitfield was baptized in the bayou that runs behind the church 54 years ago. Now he was leading the small congregation, sweat beading on his brow.Sunday at noon in the United States. Two girls and their dolls, salvation and stories in the air.

Stark, the little boy, stared out at all of this, a child of the desert in dank, humid air, and then he looked up at his father and said that when he grew up he was going to play professional soccer in Italy, and then he was going to come back to Florida and be a fishing guide.We set out to document 24 different hours in 24 states, to shine a lens on the lives of people rarely in the headlines.

So What Is That?", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNight mayor, night manager, night czar: The job has many names, but the idea is similar.Washington hopes to find someone to coordinate and manage issues \u2014 including noise complaints, reports of harassment and vomiting on the sidewalk \u2014 that affect many bars, restaurants, music venues and other businesses.A night mayor is a city\u2019s point person for issues that crop up at night, which municipalities traditionally have not separately planned for, said Jim Peters, president of the Responsible Hospitality Institute, which has helped cities like Toronto, Fort Lauderdale and Orlando create similar positions.Cities might, for example, plan roads and traffic restrictions for a daytime commute, Mr. Peters said, but not consider that a neighborhood along that route has a congested bar scene after it gets dark.A night mayor would help make sure that planners, who may work mostly during the day, hear that information, Mr. Peters said.While the idea has been around for decades, he said, many cities have more recently focused on their night life economy as they grow in size and gentrify, often drawing younger people looking for a social scene.\u201cOne city is doing it and now another city is doing it,\u201d Mr. Peters said.In New York\u2019s case, the move was also intended in part to help the city\u2019s smaller music venues, many which have struggled in the face of rising real estate prices, zoning pressures and noise complaints.In Washington, residents and business owners are increasingly confronting issues of traffic and congestion, public safety, noise, and gentrification, Lindsey Parker, the deputy chief of staff for Mayor Muriel Bowser, said in an interview.Specifics of how exactly the director will address such issues still have to be hashed out, Ms. Parker said. One of the director\u2019s first tasks will be to take stock of existing issues.Denis James, president of the Kalorama Citizens Association, which includes the neighborhood Adams Morgan that has a popular night life scene, said the city\u2019s new initiative is just an attempt to cater to business and further hamper the ability of residents to lodge noise complaints or challenge businesses that affect their quality of life.\u201cIt has very nebulous powers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interfering agent on behalf of business.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySlowdowns in investment and retail sales are cooling one of the world\u2019s most important economic engines. As the trade war with the U.S. intensifies, the downturn could get worse. Sputtering growth, soaring debt and an escalating trade war with the United States are increasingly weighing on China\u2019s economy. China\u2019s government on Friday reported that the economy grew by 6.5 percent over the three months that ended in September compared with a year ago. While fast by global standards, the pace is China\u2019s slowest since early 2009, during the depths of the global financial crisis.China has reported growth figures over the past two years that painted a picture of an economy that is gamely chugging along, despite the country\u2019s lingering problems and widespread doubts over the reliability of official numbers. A different narrative is emerging this year, one of a slowing economy that is forcing Beijing to make some difficult choices.China\u2019s stock market is firmly in the red \u2014 it has fallen by more than one-quarter since a peak in January \u2014 making it one of the world\u2019s worst performing. Companies are complaining that they cannot get money from lenders, and a handful are defaulting on their loans. The currency has weakened and is hovering near a 10-year low against the American dollar. So far it has only marginally dented China\u2019s $12 trillion economy. In recent weeks, Chinese officials have pointed to figures that show overall trade remains robust despite the conflict. On Friday, Chinese officials introduced an unusual public effort to reassure businesses and investors that China was on the right track. They blamed the lower-than-expected economic figures on global factors but said the government would take steps to keep growth on course.\u201cWe have no reason not to be confident in the bright prospects for China\u2019s economic development,\u201d Liu He, China\u2019s economic czar, told the official Xinhua news agency. China\u2019s stock market rebounded from a Friday drop after the comments from Mr. Liu and other top officials. During periods of economic slowdown, China has turned to local governments to prompt growth through big infrastructure and development projects. That approach fueled growth but saddled key parts of the economy with debt.China\u2019s expanding middle class and its increasingly expensive consumption habits have been an important pillar for growth as China moves away from its dependence on exports and big investment projects.Retail sales stayed buoyant, rising 9.2 percent in September from the previous year, as Chinese consumers continued to buy cars, appliances, smartphones and other goods. The strong numbers will help officials in Beijing to argue that the trade war has left China\u2019s domestic economy largely untouched.But economists warn that the overall rosy picture could change. For example, car sales began to slow in September, according to the China Passenger Car Association. \u201cA month from now may be just the time retailers start to buckle,\u201d wrote analysts at China Beige Book International. The group, which surveys big businesses in China, said retailers reported the worst payroll health of any sector in recent months.In September, the United States put tariffs on $200 billion worth of products coming from China. President Trump has given no indication that he will back down anytime soon.Chinese export figures for September jumped 14.5 percent compared with a year earlier. That unlikely number probably is not a sign that trade is doing well. Some exporters attributed the rise to American companies ramping up orders before new tariffs make their purchases more expensive.While much of the impact of the trade war has yet to be felt, experts say it won\u2019t take long for a slowing economy to start to feel the pinch, especially as officials grapple with other economic problems. The trade war could shave as much as 1.6 percent off China\u2019s economic growth figures next year, according to a recent report from the International Monetary Fund.\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be able to see it in the numbers that are provided and that will just add to the uncertainty,\u201d said Paul Gruenwald, global chief economist at S&P Global Ratings. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to pinpoint any pressure because we don\u2019t have enough data.\u201d But, he added, \u201cthere is definitely pessimism. It\u2019s just a question of how much it will slow things down.\u201dJust before releasing the economic growth figures on Friday morning, the websites for China\u2019s central bank, insurance and securities regulators posted news media interviews with senior officials giving support to the market. The chairman of the securities regulator went as far as to appeal to certain market participants to buy stocks.\u201cWe encourage private equity funds to purchase shares of listed companies and participate in mergers and acquisitions of listed companies,\u201d said Liu Shiyu, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.Liu He, the economic czar, said later that day to Xinhua that trade frictions with the United States had hurt the stock market, \u201cbut the psychological effect is bigger than the actual impact, frankly speaking.\u201dHe added that the United States and China were in contact, without elaborating. Trade discussions were put on hold in September after the Chinese government declined an invitation by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to hold fresh talks.Mr. Liu and Liu Shiyu were joined on Friday by Guo Shuqing, China's top banking regulator, and Yi Gang, who runs China\u2019s central bank, in publicly supporting the market. The coordinated effort by the four most important economic officials in China revealed a high level of concern on the part of the government, said Andrew Polk, a founder of Trivium, a Beijing consulting firm.\u201cIt\u2019s concerning that they need all the heavy hitters out there talking up the markets in order to assuage people\u2019s concerns,\u201d said Mr. Polk. \u201cI find it very remarkable that they chose this strategy, and somewhat alarming.\u201d\u2014 Cao Li contributed research.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Yuki Kawauchi Is Distance Running\u2019s Elite Oddball", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKUKI, Japan \u2014 Even from two blocks away the stride was familiar \u2014 muscular, insistent, arms low and wide \u2014 and the runner could be only one person, Yuki Kawauchi, improbable winner of the 2018 Boston Marathon, hamburger connoisseur and fastest man in a panda costume.Already that morning, he had put in 12\u00bd easy miles, looping through a city park while elderly men and women clacked their mallets in a croquet-like sport called gateball. A short time later, Kawauchi was off running again down an asphalt path, wearing a dress shirt, slacks and brown leather shoes. Work started in a few minutes. His office was less than a mile from home. He could time it just right.Each stride on his thick thighs is a defiance of athletic convention, a challenge of cultural norms and verification that the serious can accommodate the whimsical in world-class distance running.Kawauchi will compete in the Chicago Marathon on Sunday, and he will be a cult favorite, regardless of the outcome, a tether between world-class performers and weekend warriors as they run 26.2 miles on the same course. Citizen Runner is Kawauchi\u2019s nickname. Even the exertion that wrenches his face in each race suggests a commoner\u2019s labor.Kawauchi, 31, works 40 hours a week in the administrative office of Kuki High School in his hometown, just north of Tokyo. As a government employee, he can keep his race winnings ($150,000 for Boston) and bonus money but is not permitted to accept corporate sponsorships, including a potentially lucrative shoe contract.That will change next April, when Kawauchi plans to quit his job and devote himself completely to running. For now, he follows a singular, audacious plan.He trains with homemade weightlifting equipment, a steel bar with old running shoes duct-taped to the ends. A bicycle inner tube suffices as resistance training for his legs. He prepares his own sports drink. It is no high-tech concoction, but a mixture of water, orange juice, lemon juice, salt and honey, devised by a local school dietitian.While in Chicago, Kawauchi is sure to do two things besides run. He will eat three heaping plates of Japanese-style curry the night before the race. And at some point, he will eat a hamburger.He worked at McDonald\u2019s while obtaining a political science degree at Gakushuin University in Tokyo. (\u201cI could make a cheeseburger in 28 seconds.\u201d) Now, he photographs each burger eaten on his travels and makes a note in his journal. If he ever writes a book about marathon running, he may include a guide to gourmet burgers around the world, he said with a laugh through an interpreter.\u201cWe all know a local runner, and he runs two marathons a month and he runs them in four hours, or four and a half hours, because he just loves the activity,\u201d said Carey Pinkowski, the race director of the Chicago Marathon. \u201cYuki fits that profile, but he runs a lot faster. And he works full time and sometimes wears a panda suit.\u201d\u201cI want to entertain people a bit,\u201d he said.He has run 26 marathons under 2:12 and an astonishing 81 marathons under 2:20, both records. In a six-week stretch early in 2013, he ran the two fastest races of his career \u2014 2:08:14 and 2:08:15. When Kawauchi did not qualify for the 2012 London Olympics, he shaved his head in atonement.How does he recover to run so fast, so often? There is no simple explanation. Kawauchi has a greater capacity to consume oxygen than most elite Japanese runners, scientists said. He also possesses a version of a gene linked to sports performance that is more often associated with sprinters than with endurance runners. Even in his chromosomes, he is unconventional.Given a chance by almost no one, he won the Boston Marathon \u2014 the oldest and most prestigious of the world\u2019s annual marathons \u2014 in frigid temperatures, relentless wind and horizontal rain.Kawauchi\u2019s mother, Mika, a middle-distance runner and his first coach, made him run extra laps when he did not meet daily time requirements in elementary school. In high school, he broke down with shin splints and sore knees from overtraining. Dispirited, left to carry bags and water for his teammates, he told Runner\u2019s World magazine that he wrote in his diary, \u201cWhat am I? Human scum?\u201dIn college, Kawauchi found his passion for the marathon, but he also felt constricted by the orthodoxy of training. To relieve stress, he sometimes went to a karaoke club and sang alone in a room for hours.\u201cIf you do everything on your own and have a big success, it\u2019s your success, not the coach\u2019s success,\u201d Kawauchi said. \u201cI\u2019m my own responsibility.\u201dAfterward, as usual, Kawauchi burnished his autographs with the word \u201cbreakthrough.\u201d It would come soon enough in Boston.At 5 feet 9 inches, his weight varying between 137 and 143 pounds, Kawauchi is strong on a downhill, when racing essentially becomes a controlled fall and the best marathoners brake the least as they descend.While Boston is best known for Heartbreak Hill, that is not always the most challenging part of the course. The decisive moments often come later, on what might be called Heartbreak Downhill, much of the final five miles, where the thighs scream in agony.Kawauchi also possesses an enormous capacity to utilize oxygen, according to a measurement of endurance known as VO2 max. His peak level \u2014 82 milliliters of oxygen used in one minute per kilogram of body weight \u2014 is similar to that of the world\u2019s top endurance runners, according to Masaaki Sugita, chairman of the science committee of the Japanese Athletics Federation.Mikael Mattsson, a Swedish researcher who is leading a Stanford study of international endurance athletes, said it\u2019s \u201calmost impossible\u201d to find Japanese endurance athletes with a VO2 max above 75.On average, top Japanese runners compensate for lower VO2 max levels with high running economy or efficiency, meaning they need less oxygen to race at a given speed. Kawauchi\u2019s running economy is unremarkable, Sugita said.\u201cRoughly,\u201d Mattson said, \u201cit\u2019s comparing a Ferrari and a Prius. You can either have high power or you can have high efficiency.\u201dUpon arriving in Boston before the marathon, Kawauchi ran the final half of the course \u2014 twice. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever met another athlete more prepared than Yuki,\u201d said Mary Kate Shea, the elite athlete recruiter for the marathon.Still, almost no one expected Kawauchi to win. In the field were Geoffrey Kirui of Kenya, the 2017 Boston champion, and Galen Rupp of the United States, the 2016 Olympic bronze medalist and the winner of the 2017 Chicago Marathon.But just before the start, Larner, his agent, told him, \u201cThis is the day you were born for.\u201dThe temperature was in the 40s, with wind gusting to 35 miles an hour and pelting rain. Still, Kawauchi dressed lightly in his lucky singlet, shorts, elastic arm warmers, a cap and sunglasses with clear lenses. To shake up what he figured would be a cautious start, he ran the first mile downhill in an aggressive 4 minutes 37 seconds.And he kept making strategic attacks. Rupp, the Olympic bronze medalist, fell away and dropped out. Kirui surged into a big lead, then ran out of gas, his windbreaker seeming to provide the drag of a parachute.Seemingly startled, Kawauchi took off his cap and glasses and screamed, \u201cI did it!\u201dHe had won in 2:15:58, defeating Kirui by more than two minutes.Back home in Kuki, Kawauchi\u2019s mother, Mika, and one of his two brothers, Yoshiki, 27, also a runner, watched the end of the race on a computer and were stunned. \u201cWhat? What is he doing?\u201d she said.At a post-race party at the Red Lantern restaurant in Boston, Desi Linden of the United States, the women\u2019s winner, drank Champagne from a sneaker. Kawauchi danced and played Jenga. And, needing a quiet place, he went into the bathroom and phoned the principal of Kuki High School. The formal news conference for the winners would not be held until the next morning. It would require a change of his flight home.\u201cSorry, but I won the Boston Marathon,\u201d Kawauchi told his boss. \u201cIs it possible to have another day off?\u201dSix days after Boston, Kawauchi ran a half marathon. In fact, in the two months after his surprise and defining victory, he ran six half marathons (13.1 miles apiece), one standard marathon (26.2) miles and two ultramarathons, one 44 miles, the other 31 \u2014 a race schedule no other elite marathoners would dare attempt. They are left in wonder at Kawauchi\u2019s durability.\u201cI can\u2019t imagine going to work the next day,\u201d said Meb Keflezighi of the United States, who won the 2014 Boston Marathon, the 2009 New York City Marathon and a silver medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics. \u201cI can\u2019t walk normal for four or five days. I\u2019m walking downstairs backward. I feel like I\u2019m 80 years old. And he\u2019s going to work and going for a run.\u201dMany factors affect performance, including training, nutrition, psychology and genetics. Kawauchi possesses a variant of the widely studied ACTN3 gene \u2014 the so-called speed gene. But his version, known as 577RR, is more closely associated with fast-twitch muscle fibers and the explosive power of 100-meter sprinters than with the endurance of marathon runners.\u201cIt could be that he\u2019s done well despite having the wrong genotype for endurance runners,\u201d said Yannis Pitsiladis, a professor of sport and exercise science at the University of Brighton in England and a leading researcher on the effect of genes on sports performance.Asked if he had studied another athlete with such recovery powers, Fuku said: \u201cIn Japan, not really. It\u2019s really surprising, something else.\u201dGenes are only one factor, though. Kawauchi has been building a base of running endurance since the age of 6. Because he works, he trains once a day, not twice, as most elite marathoners do. He averages about 375 miles a month, while runners in the Japanese corporate-sponsored system average more than 600 miles.Top runners train to race. Kawauchi often races to train, using half marathons and lesser marathons to help him prepare for more important ones.Kawauchi tries to sleep at least seven and a half hours a night. And he incorporates ultralong runs into his training to build stamina. He has been known to jog the distance of a marathon three times in a week and to run 62 miles, or 100 kilometers, along a river to his home in seven and a half hours.Will Kawauchi will run faster when he quits his job and becomes a full-time runner next April? Will more training miles leave him hurt more often, and less resilient in recovery? It remains to be seen.The 2020 Tokyo Olympics are approaching, but ever the contrarian, Kawauchi said he was not interested. He has struggled running in heat and humidity. It would be a waste, he said, to prepare for the brutal conditions expected in August in Tokyo.\u201cThe Olympics aren\u2019t the only destination an athlete should go for,\u201d Kawauchi said.He has broader ambitions: To run another personal best in the marathon. To win a medal at the 2021 world track and field championships in Eugene, Ore., where the weather figures to be more accommodating. To run as many marathons in as many countries as possible. Unbound by a civil servant\u2019s job, he will be free to go off and see the world as he pleases.As a boy, Kawauchi loved to thumb through atlases and read train schedules. But when he began to run, his world turned inward. He said he thought of little but trying to follow his coach\u2019s plan perfectly. Now he makes his own plan, longs to try new things, see new places.\u201cHe\u2019s a clever runner,\u201d said Sugita, the chief scientist of Japan\u2019s track and field federation. \u201cHe thinks for himself.\u201dMakiko Inoue contributed reporting from Tokyo.

{"Headline": "Stacey Abrams Hopes Medicaid Expansion Can Be a Winning Issue in Rural Georgia", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byATLANTA \u2014 For the upscale urban audience at a campaign town hall here, it would have been enough for Stacey Abrams to pitch Medicaid expansion as a moral issue \u2014 the health-care-as-human-right argument that appeals to progressives everywhere.Instead, Ms. Abrams, the Democrat in the tossup race for Georgia governor, stuck to the pragmatic line of reasoning she has pushed in making Medicaid expansion a top priority of her campaign: It will help save the state\u2019s struggling rural towns without busting its budget, since the Affordable Care Act requires the federal government to pay 90 percent of the cost.\u201cRaise your hand if you would say no to someone who said, \u2018Give me a dollar and I\u2019ll give you $9 back,\u2019\u201d Ms. Abrams said to appreciative laughter at the event earlier this month at Clark Atlanta University, an historically black college. \u201cIt is economically false, a falsehood over all, to say we can\u2019t afford to expand Medicaid.\u201dWith health care dominating many a midterm campaign this year, Medicaid expansion has been a major talking point for Democratic gubernatorial candidates in many of the 17 states that have rejected the option, including Florida, Kansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wisconsin. But none have promoted it as forcefully as Ms. Abrams, 44, who would be the nation\u2019s first black female governor if elected and the first Democrat to lead Georgia since 1998.Her momentum with the issue reflects the experience of Democrats around the country, whose argument that Republicans will not protect access to health care, especially for the sick, seems to be influencing voters more than almost anything, from proposals on immigration and the economy to the battle over Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh\u2019s appointment to the Supreme Court.The fact that Ms. Abrams has put such a polarizing issue front and center in a conservative Deep South state \u2014 emphasizing its importance for the rural voters who helped President Trump win Georgia in 2016 \u2014 is a reminder of the defensive crouch Republicans find themselves in on health care this election cycle.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.In a sense, Ms. Abrams is following the model of Senator Doug Jones, Democrat of Alabama, who also talked up Medicaid expansion and won an unlikely victory in last year\u2019s special election in part because of strong rural black turnout.In reality, Ms Abrams could not expand Medicaid \u201con Day 1,\u201d as she likes to say \u2014 and likely not even during her first year in office. The state legislature, which has to agree to it, will almost certainly remain under Republican control. And the leadership will likely remain resistant even though a number of rank-and-file members, especially in rural areas whose hospitals are in jeopardy, could start voicing more support.But Ms. Abrams, who until last year served as minority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives, insists the legislature will have no choice but to accept Medicaid expansion before long.\u201cMost of the hospital closures are in Republican districts and they know there has to be a solution,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cI think there are real political consequences, as well as the moral and physical consequences that have been in place for so long. They can read polls as well as I can.\u201dMr. Kemp, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, has echoed the outgoing governor, Nathan Deal, also a Republican, in dismissing Medicaid expansion as too expensive.Ms Abrams puts the eventual cost to Georgia at nearly $300 million a year, though offset by savings in charity care and other areas; Republicans say it could be above $450 million. For some rural voters, Mr. Kemp\u2019s message resonates more.\u201cI don\u2019t believe in expanding Medicaid, because the free ride is just overwhelming,\u201d said Debra Mullis, 48, who owns a dog grooming business in Eastman, a city of 5,000 surrounded by farm fields, about 140 miles south of Atlanta. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start putting these people back to work.\u201dDodge County Hospital, a low-slung complex with 94 beds on the outskirts of town, is one that would benefit from Medicaid expansion. Ten percent of its patients are uninsured, compared with an average of 5 percent for hospitals nationally. If Medicaid began paying for those patients, it could help Eastman avoid the fate of a neighboring town that lost its hospital a decade ago and is still reeling from the blow.\u201cIt\u2019s vital for us,\u201d Kevin Bierschenk, the hospital\u2019s chief executive, said of expanding Medicaid. \u201cWe are already taking care of that population; we\u2019re just not getting paid for it.\u201dDr. Donald Rosenbaum, the hospital\u2019s sole orthopedic surgeon, is concerned about the cost of expanding Medicaid but hates turning away people who need non-emergency surgeries \u2014 anything, he said, beyond broken bones. As he spoke, he was preparing to operate on an uninsured man who had fractured his hand and would be left with a marked deformity, he said, without surgery.\u201cAs a Republican, I want to be financially careful and I don\u2019t want to break the state later down the line,\u201d he said. \u201cBut as a physician practicing in a rural area, quite honestly I think we just have to do it. It\u2019s our responsibility to the community.\u201dStill, Dr. Rosenbaum said he would vote for Mr. Kemp because their positions on most issues aligned.Ms. Abrams\u2019s argument that Medicaid expansion will save rural hospitals is somewhat muddied by a plan that Republican lawmakers devised to provide a dollar-for-dollar tax credit to any business or individual who donates to a struggling rural hospital. The $60 million program provided several dozen hospitals with up to $4 million each last year; Dodge County Hospital received $1.7 million, more than doubling its profit margin.Ms. Abrams dismisses the tax credit program as \u201ca Band-Aid,\u201d emphasizing that Medicaid expansion would deliver far more money \u2014 most of it from federal, not state coffers.For all the talk about Medicaid, several uninsured residents interviewed in Eastman this month predicted that race would be a more decisive factor for rural voters than health care or any other policy.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of white people around here that, by God, they just won\u2019t vote for a black person,\u201d said Charles Deloach, 57, a black resident of Eastman who sells produce on a corner across from the hospital and will \u201cmost definitely\u201d be voting for Ms. Abrams.Still, Ms. Abrams\u2019s warnings about hospital closures may have particular resonance here because the hospital in nearby McRae shut down a decade ago, forcing its residents to drive 20 miles to Eastman for care ever since. Miranda Bush, a nurse who used to work there but started at Dodge County Hospital two days after it closed, said the community had not recovered.\u201cThere was between 100 and 200 people who lost jobs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt honest to God has been devastating.\u201dThe midterm elections are around the corner. If you haven\u2019t been keeping up with what\u2019s going on, or have been and are still confused, take a look at our cheat sheet.Advertisement"}

When Ms. Green got her job at Dale\u2019s, Ms. Walls had already been there 23 years, having started at the age of 14 working a 2 p.m. to 11 p.m. shift. The two women lived as children within a few miles of each other in Whitehaven, just across the Tennessee border. (When she was 7, Ms. Walls moved to Nesbit, Miss., just nine miles from Southaven.) They both spent years raising their children as single parents. They commiserate about crime and watch their grandchildren like hawks.It took a while for them to open up to each other about politics, but that reticence is long gone.\u201cWe can talk about it but sometimes it gets heated and we have to bring ourselves down to reality,\u201d Ms. Green said. \u201cSomebody might have to come out of the office and say, \u2018What the heck is going on?\u2019\u201dTake their sparring about President Trump\u2019s comments about Dr. Blasey\u2019s testimony. They agreed they couldn\u2019t understand why women had waited so long to confront men they accused of assault, whether in the case of Bill Cosby or Brett M. Kavanaugh. And they both drew a distinction between rape and attempted rape.Ms. Walls said her own daughter was raped, beaten and left unconscious in a motel about 20 years ago. That led her to be more skeptical of Dr. Blasey\u2019s account of continuing trauma and gaps in memory, as well as any explanation that post-traumatic stress disorder might be to blame.\u201cPTSD, c\u2019mon, get real,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe she needs to talk to some servicemen that really understand PTSD. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t understand rape, big time. But if it affects you that bad, which it did my daughter, you go to counseling, whatever you need to do. My daughter\u2019s gone on just fine with her life.\u201dSo when President Trump launched into an imitation of Dr. Blasey\u2019s testimony, Ms. Walls found herself laughing along, if a bit guiltily. Ms. Green countered that when Dr. Blasey first testified, President Trump had told aides he thought she came across as sincere. Then he turned on her at the rally.\u201cAnd he got up there and they say he mocked her when he was at the center, that just doesn\u2019t sit well with me,\u201d she said. \u201cThat means you are flip-flopping on their side. As the president, you shouldn\u2019t have mocked her, period, even though Kavanaugh is going up for judge.\u201dMs. Walls: \u201cEven though what he said was true.\u201dMs. Green: \u201cShut up, C. Quit it. See, this is how we get started.\u201dBut even as they square off, they are careful with each other, reaching out to pat an arm or clutch a hand, sometimes even backing down a bit. Ms. Walls told her friend that she agreed it was unseemly for a president to act that way. \u201cHe should have been quiet, showed a little bit more integrity,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I did laugh, and I agreed, and it sounded from that crowd like everyone agreed.\u201dDeSoto County, where Southaven is located, voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump, 66 percent to 31 percent for Hillary Clinton. It was a small hamlet until the 1970s, when the suburban population expanded as courts ordered busing in nearby Memphis. An explosion of Memphis-based freight services like FedEx and Southaven\u2019s highly-regarded public schools drew more families, black and white. Now Southaven is the third-largest city in Mississippi. It\u2019s a place of pleasant, if often treeless, subdivisions and large strip malls, with no central downtown. Dale\u2019s, which opened in 1966, stands out for its bright pink exterior and is one place friends can find each other, along with church and school.Southaven is 71 percent white and 22 percent black, according to the 2010 census. Because most of its housing was developed after the 1970s, neighborhoods are generally integrated, and so are schools. But political loyalties appear starkly divided by race \u2014 nearly every white person interviewed in the area backed Mr. Trump, and every black person opposed him.Candy Jordan, a black office administrator, blames the president for incidents of racial hostility that she had never experienced before his election. She said her daughters\u2019 friend was called a racial epithet by an elderly neighbor who accused the teenager of ruining her flower bed. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between following a person and following what\u2019s right,\u201d she said.By contrast, Jill Gregory, who is raising three children in the nearby town of Olive Branch and is white, said, \u201cTrump is the only president that\u2019s been elected and he doesn\u2019t have any other interest than serving the American people.\u201dAnd so it went at Dale\u2019s, despite the evident affection of the staff for each other. Ms. Green said all the Trump supporters she knew were white, prompting an uneasy rejoinder from Melissa Thomas, the general manager. \u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d said Ms. Thomas, herself a fervent Trump backer. Last week, she and her daughter, Ms. Gregory, had made sure to be at the rally site by 6:30 a.m., nine hours before it was scheduled to start.The day after the rally was particularly trying, as Ms. Green listened to the exuberant waves of co-workers and patrons who had attended.\u201cJust like y\u2019all were tired of me talking about Obama when he was in it, I\u2019m tired about y\u2019all talking about what you did yesterday,\u201d she said she told them. \u201cAnd I walked out from the whole conversation.\u201dLater she said she realized she may have been too harsh \u2014 after all, seeing a president was part of history. But that didn\u2019t change Ms. Green\u2019s opinion of Mr. Trump, despite the argument of Ms. Thomas, the general manager, that he was improving the economy.\u201cWe got more money in our checks,\u201d Ms. Thomas told her.Ms. Green was having none of it. \u201cDo I? How do you know? You\u2019re the boss lady. Really? We don\u2019t see a change.\u201dMs. Green and Ms. Walls differ on almost everything Mr. Trump has done \u2014 the separation of immigrant children from their parents at the border, even his posture toward North Korea.But the two women cannot afford the rage that has consumed partisans these past weeks. They do not want to torpedo an affection that has deepened over the years. And so they were more modulated in their views when they were together than when they spoke separately.\u201cWe can get into some throwdowns, but five minutes later we\u2019re talking like we\u2019re best friends,\u201d Ms. Walls said.For all her ardent conservatism, Ms. Walls has her own qualms about Mr. Trump. \u201cI got to wait and see how he finishes this before I decide if I vote for him again,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a loose cannon in a lot of other ways.\u201dBut she is unyielding in her belief that the confirmation battle was a Democratic ploy to block a conservative justice. That has made her more determined to vote Republican in the midterm elections next month. Ms. Green is equally certain she\u2019ll vote Democratic and that the country would be better off with a different president.As the two women talked, Ms. Thomas drifted in and out, circling the room asking customers how they liked their heaping plates of food. The manager works seven days at week at Dale\u2019s, which just won the \u201cSpirit of Main Street\u201d award from the chamber of commerce. \u201cI cried,\u201d she said.Thinking back over the confirmation battle, listening to Ms. Green and Ms. Walls joke and joust, she allowed herself a plaintive question. It was about the country as much as the chatter at Dale\u2019s: \u201cHow can we both hear the same thing and get something totally different out of it?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Uber and Lyft Are in an I.P.O. Race", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byUber and Lyft compete aggressively in the American ride-hailing market. And now that competition could extend into a battle for investors as the companies push for stock market debuts in 2019.The first to go public would get dibs on investors eager for a piece of the ride-hailing business. That could be especially important for Lyft, given that its I.P.O. would most likely be swamped by its much bigger rival\u2019s, whose offering would be the biggest to hit the market since Alibaba\u2019s in 2014.Positive earnings reports, including from Goldman Sachs and Netflix, were factors, as were strong economic data, which showed a fourth straight month of industrial production gains and job openings at a record high.The ratio for the companies in the S.&P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.That level of investor risk-taking could augur well for the stock market, Mr. Eavis writes \u2014 but may evaporate if another big tech company, like Facebook, delivers disappointing earnings.To make the strategy work, the administration is counting on its relationship with the Saudis to keep global oil flowing without spiking prices, and to work together on a new policy to contain Iran in the Persian Gulf.Richard Haas of the Council on Foreign Relations summed up the fine line Mr. Trump must walk: \u201cIt\u2019s a neat trick if you can both sanction a country and partner with them at the same time.\u201dJudge Alison Nathan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said that the settlements were \u201cfair, reasonable and will serve the interests of the public and investors.\u201d She did not mention Mr. Musk\u2019s more recent Twitter antics, such as a tweet where he appeared to call the agency the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission.\u201dGoogle has always made its Android operating system available for free. It\u2019s a way to get its apps on as many devices as possible, and to collect data about users and sell advertising. But in Europe, it will now charge handset manufacturers to install apps like Gmail and Google Maps.It\u2019s a response to a European antitrust ruling in July that hit Google with a roughly $5 billion fine for unfairly bundling free Android services to maintain its market dominance. (Google is appealing the decision, but it faced a deadline by which it had to change operations or risk further punishment.)The ultimate effect of the change announced on Tuesday remains to be seen, but European customers will probably see a wider variety of Android devices to choose from. Some will come with Google\u2019s services; others may more prominently feature applications made by competitors.\u201cThe potential amount of debt is an iceberg with titanic credit risks,\u201d S.&P. credit analysts led by Gloria Lu wrote in a report Tuesday. Much of the buildup relates to local government financing vehicles, which don\u2019t necessarily have the full financial backing of local governments themselves.That may be a big worry: China\u2019s economy has slowed and defaults have risen this year. Beijing could struggle to contain this latest debt bubble.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "Parts of America Are Still Struggling Economically. They Don\u2019t Matter Much in the Midterms. ", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe most competitive districts in the race for control of the House are disproportionately prosperous \u2014 and their economies aren\u2019t doing much to lift Republicans.That appears to be the right audience for a closing pitch, but it may not pay off as the president hopes. The competitive districts that will decide control of the House are richer and more economically vibrant than the country as a whole. But there is little evidence that the thriving economies in those districts are buoying Republican candidates enough to guarantee victories against well-funded Democratic challengers.The concentration of battlegrounds in prosperous areas could have important policy implications for the next Congress, with swing-district representatives more concerned with preserving their region\u2019s own good fortunes than with helping large parts of the country that continue to lag economically.Consider three Republican-held districts that the Cook Political Report ranks among the 73 most competitive races this fall: In California\u2019s 49th District, the typical household earned nearly $90,000 last year, a 9 percent jump from the year before. In Minnesota\u2019s Third District, the poverty rate is down to half the national average. In Virginia\u2019s 10th District, unemployment is at a rock bottom 2.6 percent, well below the national jobless rate of 3.7 percent.Democrats have tried to use the economy against Mr. Trump, even though job creation and economic growth are strong. In competitive contests in well-off districts, Democratic candidates criticize Mr. Trump and Republicans about the rising costs of housing and health care as well as the inequity and long-term costs of the tax cuts.\u201cI see a lot of people who, if they vote with their pocketbook, and they\u2019ve maybe sided with Republicans because of that, they\u2019re taking another look\u201d this year, said Mike Levin, the Democratic candidate in California\u2019s 49th District, which includes a strip of coastline running from north of San Diego to the southern suburbs of Los Angeles. \u201cToday, I feel like, to the extent we\u2019ve seen gains, we\u2019re on a sugar high. And I have young kids \u2014 I know a lot about that.\u201dIt is possible, of course, that Republicans in tight races would be in even worse shape were it not for the strong economy. An analysis of polling data suggests Republican candidates are performing modestly better, relative to expectations based on their performances in past elections, in districts where the unemployment rate is lower or has fallen faster than in other districts. On a national level, the economy may be helping lift Mr. Trump's approval ratings, which, if historical patterns hold, could help Republicans avoid steeper losses in the midterm elections.But those effects are not nearly large enough to help Republicans avoid costly and contentious races in some of the most vibrant parts of the country, particularly in suburbs of high-performing metropolitan areas. \u201cThose are the places where the president is the most toxic, outside of urban areas,\u201d said Amy Walter, the national political editor of the Cook Report. \u201cIt\u2019s not about their pocketbook. It\u2019s about partisanship, and it\u2019s also about cultural issues.\u201dOnly six of the most competitive districts rank as \u201cdistressed,\u201d the lowest quintile in the index.As a group, the 70 most competitive districts have not seen their incomes grow more, or their unemployment rates drop faster, than the rest of the country since Mr. Trump took office. But they began the Trump era in better shape than the rest of the country.In 2017, the median household income in a typical competitive district was just over $66,000, according to the Census Bureau. For the typical noncompetitive district, it was just under $57,000. The median income for a \u201cprosperous\u201d competitive district was more than $73,000. Those districts frequently run through the suburbs of large cities in high-income states. The \u201cprosperous\u201d and \u201ccomfortable\u201d list includes four districts in California and three each in New Jersey, Minnesota, Florida and Texas. It also includes Colorado\u2019s Sixth District, one of the most prosperous in the nation according to the Economic Innovation Group rankings, where the incumbent, Representative Mike Coffman, a Republican, is trailing badly in the polls.The broad universe of competitive seats is wealthier and whiter than the nation as a whole, the Economic Innovation Group analysis finds. But in a narrower group of seats that could hand Democrats control of the House by themselves \u2014 those that Cook ranks as \u201ctoss up\u201d or \u201clean Democratic\u201d \u2014 the relatively high-earning population includes a larger share of immigrants than the typical district. The toss-up districts \u201care by and large pretty dynamic places, where the status quo is working rather well,\u201d John Lettieri, the president of the Economic Innovation Group, said in an interview. \u201cThings like globalization and immigration aren\u2019t things to be feared there. They\u2019re woven into the fabric.\u201dThat is certainly the case in west Houston and its suburbs, where the incumbent, Representative John Culberson, a Republican, is running neck and neck with Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, a Democrat, in the toss-up Seventh Congressional District. More than a quarter of the population was born abroad. More than half is nonwhite. Mr. Culberson is leaning into the economy in his campaign. He said in an interview that his constituents, no matter where they were born, wanted a fiscal conservative to continue \u201cthe obviously successful economic policies\u201d that have contributed to the growth of the area and its oil and gas companies.\u201cVoters in my district understand that I\u2019m the right person in the right place at the right time to keep the economy growing,\u201d Mr. Culberson said, \u201cbecause I always support tax cuts, I always support lightening the regulatory load, I always support the oil and gas industry.\u201dThose issues \u2014 and the nature of the House battlegrounds \u2014 stand in stark contrast to Mr. Trump\u2019s focus in the weeks before the midterm elections, which has lingered on warnings about immigrants, particularly those in a caravan heading north from Central America. The warnings may do more to help rally conservatives in Mr. Trump\u2019s base in many conservative states that are home to contentious Senate races, including North Dakota and Missouri. Mr. Trump\u2019s new $6 million national television ad appears targeted more to the suburban voters who will decide control of the House. It features a woman in a leafy home, watching her young daughter play violin and remembering the aftermath of the recession. The woman votes Republican; her daughter appears to grow up to be a concert violinist. \u201cThings are getting better,\u201d the ad reads in closing. \u201cWe can\u2019t go back.\u201dMs. Walter of the Cook Report said the ad might struggle to break through \u2014 against Mr. Trump\u2019s own messaging.\u201cO.K., that\u2019s a nice ad, but he\u2019s spending all day talking about birthright citizenship and sending troops to the border,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich one should we be watching?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Saltier the Licorice, the Happier the Country. Just Look at Finland.", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K.

She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios.

The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk.

It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day.

The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTrade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times. She has won two James Beard Foundation awards for restaurant criticism.For millions of Latin Americans, the Colombina factory in La Paila is the place where sweet moments are made.Leer en enspa\u00f1olFor nearly 50 years, Bon Bon Bums have been produced in the Colombina factory in La Paila, north of Cali. At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Brazil Edges Toward Bolsonaro as a \u2018Last Resort\u2019 Leader", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 By the time Brazilians were done voting Sunday, mighty power brokers had been tossed out of office, long-dominant political parties had been humbled, and a far-right populist suddenly looked like he just might be the most powerful man in the country.It was, in short, the most sweeping political shift Brazil had ever seen in a single election since democracy was restored in 1985.\u201cWhat we are watching today is the collapse of our current system,\u201d said Maria Herm\u00ednia Tavares de Almeida, a political scientist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo.The near-winner in the first round of voting in the presidential race was Jair Bolsonaro, a former army captain. He offered few detailed policies. But his draconian approach toward fighting violence \u2014 he would make it easier to for the police to kill suspected criminals and imprison more people for longer \u2014 appealed to many in a nation traumatized by rising crime, a dispiriting economy and a political class widely regarded as venal and unresponsive.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s show of \u201cdiscipline and strength\u201d has attracted middle-class voters, said Thiago Arag\u00e3o, a political consultant based in Bras\u00edlia. \u201cThey treat Bolsonaro as a last resort, as someone who could contain the growth of violence in Brazil,\u201d he said.This is a shocking reversal for Brazil. When the country emerged from two decades of military rule in 1985, the population celebrated the end of a regime that had killed or disappeared 434 people and tortured thousands.In 2002 Brazilians elected as president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a former metal worker who rose through union ranks as he fought to bring down the dictatorship. He was followed in office by Dilma Rousseff, his handpicked successor and a former guerrilla who was tortured under the dictatorship.The Workers\u2019 Party governed until 2016, when it was swept out of office after the impeachment of Ms. Rousseff amid a painful recession and a widespread investigation into graft that tainted much of the country\u2019s political leadership.That series of traumas has made some older Brazilians look back to the military years with nostalgia \u2014 a sentiment openly embraced by Mr. Bolsonaro, who says he intends to name military officers to his cabinet. This is a huge shift in a country where the military has largely stayed out of politics for 30 years.Brazilians are not alone in their demand for radical change. Support for democracy in Latin America is at its lowest level in more than a decade, according to the pollster Latinobar\u00f3metro. In Brazil in 2017, only 13 percent of the population said they were very satisfied democracy \u2014 far below the average of 30 percent for the region. Elsewhere in the world, frustration with the status quo has fueled the rise of populists with open disdain for democratic institutions like a free press and an independent judiciary.As Mr. Bolsonaro and his opponent in the election, Fernando Haddad of the leftist Workers\u2019 Party, geared up on Monday for the second round of votes on Oct. 28, Brazil\u2019s political establishment was struggling to make sense of the political earthquake that had just rattled the nation.Candidates affiliated with Mr. Bolsonaro performed far better than polls had suggested, an indication he could have robust support in Congress and among elected officials across the country if he becomes president.The Social Liberal Party, which Mr. Bolsonaro joined earlier this year to launch his presidential bid, became a behemoth overnight, expanding its footprint in the lower House of Congress from eight seats to 52. That makes it the second-largest party in that chamber, trailing only the Workers\u2019 Party, which lost five seats.There was also shock over the success of a regional candidate who was virtually unknown until Mr. Bolsonaro threw his weight behind him in the last days of the race.Polls had suggested that the candidate, Wilson Witzel, a retired federal judge and military veteran running for governor of Rio de Janeiro, had no shot at victory over his better-known opponent. But with Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s backing, Mr. Witzel won 41 percent of the vote, more than twice his opponent\u2019s tally.As they took stock of the new political landscape, political scientists and academics said Monday that the Bolsonaro phenomenon may have forever changed how campaigns are run in Brazil.Unlike rivals who had far more time on national television \u2014 which is awarded based on party size \u2014 and who bought polished ads, Mr. Bolsonaro ran a scrappy, inexpensive campaign powered mainly by social media. Supporters created hundreds of group chats on the messaging app WhatsApp, which the vast majority of Brazilians use, sharing campaign information, jokes, memes and conspiracy theories.Victor Piaia, a sociologist who studies political communication at the State University in Rio de Janeiro, said it was unclear how much the campaign had coordinated with chat groups. But he said it was clear it had played a role in steering the narratives and benefited from the platform\u2019s message-amplifying effect.\u201cThis type of communication is less top-down,\u201d said Mr. Piaia. \u201cEveryone is the curator of their own content, and this makes the information distributed there more appealing.\u201dMr. Piaia said he was especially surprised at how successful the Bolsonaro campaign was in directing down-ballot votes. While other political parties were handing out pamphlets on the streets, it spent weeks distributing a message with the names of candidates it supported through WhatsApp groups.Among the biggest losers on Sunday were elected officials who have been embroiled in the far-ranging corruption investigation known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash. According to the newspaper Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo, 47 politicians who have been charged with corruption, or are being investigated, were not re-elected.Among them was the president of the Senate, who is being investigated for corruption and money laundering, and a former governor and minister who was caught on a wiretap telling a colleague they needed to find a way to \u201cstop the bleeding,\u201d an apparent reference to the toll the corruption investigation was taking on the political elite.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s promise to take a zero-tolerance approach to corruption has extraordinary appeal for some voters who have come to see their leaders as kleptocrats. But on Monday, some of the candidate\u2019s supporters said fears that he could be despotic were overblown. And some suggested that law-abiding Brazilians need not worry.Adriana Giotto, 77, a retired lawyer, said she had no traumatic memories of the military dictatorship.\u201cThose who are good citizens were not affected by the dictatorship in a negative way,\u201d she said. \u201cThe dictatorship made mistakes and killed many people, but it was those who choose to live outside the rules of social harmony who set the stage for that to happen.\u201dCarolina Cremonez da Silva, 31, said that kind of mind-set terrified her.\u201cBolsonaro legitimizes violence, authoritarianism\u201d said Ms. da Silva, a psychologist. \u201cHe ends up getting many supporters because people are afraid. They are people who want that iron fist, that authoritarian regime, without understanding what that represents for society.\u201dMariana Sim\u00f5es contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Behind the Clash Over Italy\u2019s Budget, a Fear of Populism", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBRUSSELS \u2014 Just a few years ago, the European Union faced down a populist Greek government whose debts threatened the common currency, the euro, and the very integrity of the bloc.But if the European Union thought the problem was behind it, it is now back \u2014 and bigger and more dangerous than ever \u2014 in Italy, whose populist government is also insisting on breaching bloc rules for fiscal discipline in order to keep faith with its voters.This clash between an elected government that ran on increasing public spending and the technocrats of Brussels encapsulates the dilemma at the heart of the European Union \u2014 its democratic deficit as it tries to manage a currency shared by differing sovereign states without a common budget or finance minister.But looming behind the current clash over the budget lies a much deeper fear in the European Union: that it will give more fuel to a populist, euroskeptic wave across the Continent before elections for a new European Parliament in May.So far, European populism has played out on national stages. But a major showing by populists in the European elections would sharply change the balance of power in the European Parliament, affecting the makeup of the European Commission \u2014 the executive branch of the bloc \u2014 and potentially rendering European Union institutions even more ineffective.This larger political anxiety is part of the real debate over how to handle Italy and its defiant budget, European officials say.As the Italian deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini, a right-wing populist from the League, has used the migration issue to bash Brussels and increase his popularity, his coalition partner and rival, Luigi Di Maio, a left-wing populist from the Five Star Movement, is expected to use the clash over the budget to raise his own standing at home.If divisions in the Greek and Portuguese governments undercut their challenges to Brussels, \u201cthe divisions in the Italian coalition all serve to reinforce the need to stick it to Brussels and stand firm both on fiscal policy and migration,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, chief European analyst for the Eurasia Group, a consultancy.Mr. Salvini has vowed to cut taxes, while Mr. Di Maio has pledged a guaranteed income for the unemployed and the poor. Both want to keep their promises.The fear in Brussels is that if the technocrats are too tough on the Italians, they could galvanize support for Mr. Salvini and the rest of Europe\u2019s populists and create institutional challenges for the bloc for the next five years at least.\u201cThe current Italian government has its own dose of preposterousness,\u2019\u2019 she said. \u2018\u2018But it\u2019s still elected. They have signed agreements with Brussels and should honor them, but elected governments also have the ability to change their minds. And there\u2019s no good answer on how you punish a country.\u201dThe European Union enforced its will on tiny Greece, which was in desperate straits, Ms. Demertzis said. \u201cThe way that 27 nations imposed themselves on a sovereign nation is still something we haven\u2019t gotten our heads around. This is where the E.U. attempts to square a circle and the democratic deficit comes in.\u201dThe result is that \u201cGreece is no longer a sovereign country, but exists in a debtor-creditor relationship with Brussels,\u201d Ms. Demertzis said. \u201cIt creates a lot of resentment and anger.\u201dOf course, Italy is not Greece, and it has much more room to maneuver. Italy is still able to finance itself, and the markets \u2014 which had forced Greece and Portugal to concede \u2014 are ambivalent, seeing more of a political crisis today than an economic one.A serious debt crisis for Italy is still only hypothetical, if more plausible now than before. But given Italy\u2019s size and its status as a core country of the bloc, a crisis, should it come, could be unmanageable and have consequences not just for the European economy but also for the world.Italy is the eurozone\u2019s third-largest economy, and it has a cumulative debt of some $2.6 trillion \u2014 among the world\u2019s top five debt loads, and at nearly 132 percent of gross domestic product, more than twice the maximum of 60 percent allowed under European rulesThe debt is so large that even though some 70 percent of it is held domestically, there is significant exposure for German, French and American banks. But a crisis would badly hurt Italians first of all, including small-business leaders who voted for this government, so it is unlikely that Rome wants to throw itself over the cliff.Still, if investors get really frightened and the cost of Italian borrowing spikes down the road, Italy\u2019s debt payments could get out of control. The Greek bailout cost about $300 billion, and Greece is tiny compared with Italy, whose economy is nearly 10 times as large.Then the European Central Bank would have to decide whether Italy really is too big to fail, especially if the stakes include the very existence of the euro currency. \u201cWould European countries really be prepared to break the euro?\u201d asked Ms. Demertzis of Bruegel.So the nightmare is out there, distant on the horizon. And that, of course, is another part of the balance that Brussels is seeking, as officials emphasize that they are open to dialogue with Italy over its budget, and some economists suggest that given Italy\u2019s essentially stagnant growth \u2014 under 1 percent a year \u2014 some fiscal expansion might be beneficial. Still, in the longer run, the message goes, what Italy is doing is incompatible with membership in the euro and the single market.Italy has three weeks to respond to the European Commission, but it probably would not pass a budget until the end of the year. The commission could then put Italy into something called the \u201cexcess deficit procedure,\u201d which could eventually lead to fines and sanctions.But all that will take time \u2014 and the May elections are not so far away.\u201cIt\u2019s all about timing,\u201d Mr. Rahman said. \u201cBut it\u2019s also about democracy and membership. And this is the issue that policymakers in France, Germany and Brussels are most concerned about.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "White Americans Gain the Most From Trump\u2019s Tax Cuts, a Report Finds", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe differing benefits by race reflect longstanding patterns of economic inequality and the structure of the law President Trump signed last year.In total, the analysis estimates, whites will get $218 billion in tax cuts this year as a result of the law. Black and Latino Americans will get about $32 billion combined. \u201cThe average income for white taxpayers is significantly higher than for black or Latino taxpayers,\u201d said Meg Wiehe, the economic policy institute\u2019s deputy director. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge driver.\u201dIt appears, though, that even among top earners, whites have fared better than other Americans under the law \u2014 probably because the tax cuts affect individual taxpayers differently depending on how they make their money.The average tax cut, as a share of pretax income, for a white or Asian-American household in the top 1 percent of income earners was nearly 3 percent, the analysis found. For Latinos, it was 1.7 percent. For blacks, it was 1.2 percent.\u201cEven if you\u2019re a successful black or Latino household in the top 1 percent, you\u2019ve achieved the American dream, you\u2019ve hit it out of the park,\u201d said David Newville, director of federal policy at Prosperity Now, \u201cyou\u2019re still not getting the same returns from this bill as a white household.\u201dThe report\u2019s authors note that Congress could have structured the cuts differently in ways that targeted lower- and middle-income taxpayers more directly. They also stress that by steering more money to whites, the law could exacerbate an already stark racial wealth divide in the United States. A poll conducted this month for The New York Times by the online research platform SurveyMonkey found that white Americans were far more likely to approve of the new tax law than those who aren\u2019t white. The poll found that 55 percent of whites approved of the law, compared with 40 percent of Hispanics and 33 percent of blacks.\u201cCongress missed a tremendous opportunity\u201d with the tax law, the report\u2019s authors write, \u201cto help low- and moderate-income families \u2014 particularly those of color \u2014 build the wealth needed to secure their share of the American dream.\u201d The analysis found one way in which the cuts were relatively colorblind: Those geared toward middle-class families were, as a share of income, roughly the same across races. But because so many more white taxpayers are in the middle quintile of income earners compared with blacks and Latinos, the white middle class reaped much larger benefits: just over $15 billion total, compared with just over $3 billion for middle-income Latinos and just over $2 billion for middle-income blacks.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Jamal Khashoggi Case: Suspects Had Ties to Saudi Crown Prince", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThree others are linked by witnesses and other records to the Saudi crown prince\u2019s security detail.A fifth is a forensic doctor who holds senior positions in the Saudi Interior Ministry and medical establishment, a figure of such stature that he could be directed only by a high-ranking Saudi authority.The New York Times has confirmed independently that at least nine of 15 suspects identified by Turkish authorities worked for the Saudi security services, military or other government ministries. One of them, Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, was a diplomat assigned to the Saudi Embassy in London in 2007, according to a British diplomatic roster. He traveled extensively with the crown prince, perhaps as a bodyguard.How much blame for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance or death settles on the 33-year-old crown prince has become a decisive factor in his standing in the eyes of the West and within the royal family.The prince has presented himself as a reformer intent on opening up the kingdom\u2019s economy and culture, and has used that image to try to influence White House policy in the region and to woo Western investors to help diversify the Saudi economy.But the international revulsion at the reported assassination and mutilation of a single newspaper columnist \u2014 Mr. Khashoggi, who wrote for The Washington Post \u2014 has already sullied that image far more than previous missteps by the crown prince, from miring his country in a catastrophic war in Yemen to kidnapping the prime minister of Lebanon.The crown prince and his father, King Salman, have denied any knowledge of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s whereabouts, repeatedly asserting that he left the consulate freely. Saudi officials did not respond to requests for comment for this article.President Trump floated the possibility on Monday that Mr. Khashoggi was the victim of \u201crogue killers.\u201dBut such explanations would run up against a host of hard-to-explain obstacles.The suspects\u2019 positions in the Saudi government and their links to the crown prince could make it more difficult to absolve him of responsibility.Turkish officials have said they possess evidence that the 15 Saudi agents flew into Istanbul on Oct. 2, assassinated Mr. Khashoggi, dismembered his body with a bone saw they had brought for the purpose, and flew out the same day. Records show that two private jets chartered by a Saudi company with close ties to the Saudi crown prince and Interior Ministry arrived and left Istanbul on the day of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.The Times gathered more information about the suspects using facial recognition, publicly available records, social media profiles, a database of Saudi cellphone numbers, Saudi news reports, leaked Saudi government documents and in some cases the accounts of witnesses in Saudi Arabia and countries the crown prince has visited.Mr. Mutreb, the former diplomat in London, was photographed emerging from airplanes with Prince Mohammed on recent trips to Madrid and Paris. He was also photographed in Houston, Boston and the United Nations during the crown prince\u2019s visits there, often glowering as he surveyed a crowd.A French professional who has worked with the Saudi royal family identified a second suspect, Abdulaziz Mohammed al-Hawsawi, as a member of the security team that travels with the crown prince.A Saudi news outlet reported that someone with the same name as a third suspect, Thaar Ghaleb al-Harbi, was promoted last year to the rank of lieutenant in the Saudi royal guard for bravery in the defense of Prince Mohammed\u2019s palace in Jeddah.Members of the royal guard or aides who traveled with the crown prince may not report directly to him and may sometimes take on other duties. It is possible that some could have been recruited for an expedition to capture or interrogate Mr. Khashoggi, perhaps led by a senior intelligence official. But the presence among the suspects of an autopsy expert, Dr. Salah al-Tubaigy, suggests that killing might have been part of the original plan.Dr. Tubaigy, who maintained a presence on several social media platforms, identified himself on his Twitter account as the head of the Saudi Scientific Council of Forensics and held lofty positions in the kingdom\u2019s premier medical school as well as in its Interior Ministry. He studied at the University of Glasgow and in 2015 he spent three months in Australia as a visiting forensic pathologist at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine. His published writings include works on dissection and mobile autopsies.Although there is no public record of a relationship between him and the royal court, such a senior figure in the Saudi medical establishment was unlikely to join a rogue expedition organized by an underling.Dr. Tubaigy, whose name first appeared among reports of the suspects several days ago, has not publicly addressed the allegations. None of the suspects could be reached for comment.David D. Kirkpatrick reported from Istanbul, Malachy Browne from New York, Ben Hubbard from Beirut, and David Botti in New York.

{"Headline": "Saudis May Admit Khashoggi Was Killed in Interrogation by Mistake", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 Saudi Arabia was preparing an alternative explanation of the fate of a dissident journalist on Monday, saying he died at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago in an interrogation gone wrong, according to a person familiar with the kingdom\u2019s plans. In Washington, President Trump echoed the possibility that Jamal Khashoggi was the victim of \u201crogue killers.\u201dThe shifting story line defied earlier details that have emerged in the case, including signs that he was murdered and dismembered. Among other things, Turkish officials have said, an autopsy specialist carrying a bone saw was among 15 Saudi operatives who flew in and out of Istanbul the day Mr. Khashoggi disappeared.And it could help Turkey, where a shaky economy would benefit from a financial infusion that low-interest loans from Riyadh could provide.But the theory was widely dismissed among Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s friends, human rights advocates and some on Capitol Hill, who noted that Saudi officials had denied his death for two weeks \u2014 including assertions by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman last week and the king himself on Monday.\u201cIt sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers \u2014 who knows,\u201d Mr. Trump said, speaking to reporters as he headed to visit areas in Georgia and Florida that were ravaged by Hurricane Michael.Mr. Trump also said he told the king: \u201cThe world is watching. The world is talking, and this is very important to get to the bottom of it.\u201d The Saudi state news service reported a different take on the conversation, in which Mr. Trump praised the cooperation between the Saudis and Turkish officials as they investigate Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.Turkish officials have said Mr. Khashoggi was killed and dismembered after he disappeared in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago.Later on Monday, a person familiar with the Saudi government\u2019s plans said that Mr. Khashoggi was mistakenly killed during an interrogation ordered by a Saudi intelligence official who was a friend of the crown prince. The person, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Prince Mohammed had approved interrogating or even forcing Mr. Khashoggi to return to Saudi Arabia under duress.But, the person said, the Saudi intelligence official went too far in eagerly seeking to prove himself in secretive operations, then sought to cover up the botched job.Azzam Tamimi, an Islamist friend of Mr. Khashoggi, called the \u201crogue\u201d theory \u201cdisastrous\u201d for the credibility of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey.\u201cThe Turks have leaked so much that it is inconceivable that they would settle for less than telling the world exactly what happened,\u201d said Mr. Tamimi, who met Mr. Khashoggi for lunch in London the day before he disappeared.Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fate has transfixed official Washington, bedeviled the Saudis, helped revive Mr. Erdogan\u2019s international reputation and threatened core foreign policy priorities of the Trump administration.Mr. Trump dispatched Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Riyadh on Monday to meet with King Salman. \u201cDetermining what happened to Jamal Khashoggi is something of great importance to the president,\u201d said Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman.The Saudi Embassy in Washington also canceled its National Day party, which was scheduled for Oct. 18.Advisors close to Prince Mohammed said he was shocked by the universal condemnation after Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.That has firmed up a growing belief in Western circles that the prince who fueled a war in Yemen to the point of humanitarian disaster, imposed an intemperate blockade against Qatar, arrested a clutch of Saudi elites for money and took two weeks to come up with a passable explanation for Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fate is not ready for the throne.\u201cMany in Washington have reached the conclusion that this is a guy we can\u2019t do business with,\u201d said Gerald M. Feierstein, the director for government relations, policy and programs at the Middle East Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, and a former United States ambassador to Yemen.The Saudi energy minister circulated a statement on Monday reminding Washington journalists that the kingdom had long served as the world\u2019s energy \u201cshock absorber.\u201d He asked that \u201cthe global community of nations will respect and acknowledge what Saudi Arabia has done.\u201dWithin five days of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance on Oct. 2, Turkish security officials claimed anonymously that they had obtained evidence that the journalist was killed inside the consulate. The evidence never surfaced, however, and the claims stopped after a sudden increase in high-level diplomatic contacts between Turkey and Saudi Arabia.That frustrated American intelligence and diplomatic officials, who worried that the Turks were citing the evidence as leverage to get loans from the Saudis.American intelligence agencies had previously intercepted communications of Saudi officials discussing a plan to draw Mr. Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia from his home in exile in the Washington area and then detain him, a former senior American official said last week. Those intercepts were shared with senators in classified materials last week, making it impossible to suppress them.It is highly unlikely an attempted rendition of Mr. Khashoggi could have been carried out without the knowledge of Saudi rulers.For the Trump administration, Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s case risks top foreign policy priorities. Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he does not want to risk what he claims is $110 billion in arms sales to the Saudis. And ensuring Riyadh\u2019s willingness to increase oil production so that coming sanctions on Iranian oil do not lead to a surge in gas prices has been at least as important.The United States\u2019 relationship with the Saudis has always been something of a delicate balance, weighing economic considerations such as oil and arms sales with the kingdom\u2019s record on human rights.Gardiner Harris and Eileen Sullivan reported from Washington, and David D.

{"Headline": "Syria Reopens Border Link to Jordan, as Assad Reasserts Control", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAMMAN, Jordan \u2014 The Syrian government celebrated the reopening on Monday of a vital border crossing with Jordan as a new sign of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s reestablished control over much of the country and of progress in his efforts to normalize relations with other Arab states.The civil war that has torn apart Syria since 2011 has ravaged the country\u2019s economy and severed many of its regional relationships, and Mr. Assad, along with his Russian and Iranian allies, is now hoping that he can undo the damage.The Nasib border crossing, along Syria\u2019s southern border with Jordan, was closed for three years because the territory on the Syrian side was controlled by mix of armed rebels and jihadist fighters. The Syrian government seized the area this summer with the help of Russian airstrikes, allowing the crossing to reopen.The Nasib crossing is a vital economic artery for the two countries, and its opening allows Syria to export produce and other goods to Jordan and send it on to other Arab countries.The economic activity also provides a source of employment for many drivers and merchants on the Jordanian side, and Lebanon, Syria\u2019s neighbor to the west, also stands to benefit from the export route.Cars and trucks carrying passengers and merchants began crossing after the border was opened Monday morning.Syrian officials clearly saw the opening as the start of a wider normalization with other Arab states after seven years of civil war that left the country diplomatically isolated.Speaking alongside his Iraqi counterpart in Damascus, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem of Syria expressed hopes that his country\u2019s Albu Kamal crossing with Iraq would open soon, too.\u201cThe general mutual interest that these crossings create between the people is what lasts, and therefore we look at this broadly,\u201d he said.Ibrahim al-Jaafari, the Iraqi foreign minister, offered an encouraging responses, talking of improving relations with Syria and reintegrating it into the Arab world. \u201cNo one can marginalize Syria, and I raised the necessity of its return to the Arab League,\u201d he said.The 22-member Arab League froze Syria\u2019s membership after the civil war broke out, largely because of widespread disgust for the intensity with which Mr. Assad sought to crush the uprising against his rule.Many Arab states remain deeply hostile to Mr. Assad\u2019s government, and it remains unclear when Syria might be readmitted as a member.The developments on the Nasib crossing coincided with a decision by the Israeli Army on Monday to reopen the Quneitra crossing between the Syrian- and Israeli-controlled portions of the Golan Heights, a formal recognition by one of Mr. Assad\u2019s foes that his grip on southern Syria was secure.The crossing was first established at the end of the 1973 Yom Kippur War, when the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force was established to carry out the cease-fire between Israel and Syria, creating a demilitarized zone.The crossing allowed United Nations troops to move freely between the territories controlled by the two countries.While no major trade passed through the crossing between the two states, which remain enemies, it did allow for members of the local Druze population, who live on both sides of the dividing line, to visit relatives \u2014 the subject of the 2004 film \u201cThe Syrian Bride.\u201dThe crossing was closed in 2014 after attacks by Syrian rebels and jihadists, who at various points captured dozens of United Nations peacekeepers. But United Nations troops have gradually returned to the Israel-Syria border in recent months. The crossing is being reopened only for those forces, the Israeli army said.Rana F.

{"Headline": "Where Chicago Trounces New York: Fixing Mass Transit", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCHICAGO \u2014 Like New York\u2019s subway, it is another century-old system struggling to keep up with the transit demands of a booming city. It, too, has been plagued by crumbling tracks, antiquated signals and unreliable trains that turn routine commutes into nightmares.But the difference is that Chicago\u2019s L has made a comeback, reversing decades of cost-cutting and neglect.Today, nearly one-third of its tracks have been rebuilt for faster and smoother rides. Rail cars from the 1970s have been replaced with the latest models. More than three dozen stations have been overhauled, many rebuilt into sleek, steel-and-glass outposts. There are new elevators, wider platforms, high-definition security cameras and works by Chicago artists.\u201cWe\u2019ve had a pretty impressive turnaround,\u201d said Joseph P. Schwieterman, a professor of public service at DePaul University. \u201cIt\u2019s still an old system \u2014 and we still have delays \u2014 but the problems are staying out of the headlines and that\u2019s quite an achievement.\u201dChicago could have taken baby steps to shore up its failing system. Instead, it embarked on a slew of ambitious projects to reimagine the L. Total bill? $7.2 billion since 2011.The Chicago Transit Authority spent $425 million to tear out and rebuild 10.2 miles of the southern end of the Red Line in 2013, choosing to shut down the entire section for five months \u2014 using free buses to shuttle riders to other stations \u2014 rather than spread the work over four years of nights and weekends, which has been New York\u2019s approach.A year later came a $492 million rehabilitation of the Blue Line to improve service between downtown Chicago and O\u2019Hare International Airport. Now, it is pushing ahead on its most costly project, a $2.1 billion reconstruction of the northern end of the Red and Purple Lines.Some stations are being turned into community anchors. At the 95th Street Station, where a $280 million terminal replaced a shabby building with no doors to keep out the cold, a community radio station will broadcast live. There will be a food co-op next to the Wilson Station and an incubator for businesses steps from the Garfield Station.\u201cIt is not just about moving people from Point A to Point B,\u201d said Dorval R. Carter Jr., the president of the Chicago Transit Authority. \u201cThese investments are also connecting people to their community.\u201dIn contrast, New York\u2019s subway has been a pawn in the political feud between Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, who controls the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and Mayor Bill de Blasio, also a Democrat. Each has blamed the other for its dismal state.Mr. Emanuel, who took office in 2011, said in an interview that a reliable and efficient transit system is essential for a 21st-century city. It improves quality of life, allowing families to spend more time together and less time commuting. It spurs economic development, helping to create jobs and attract relocating companies.Mr. Emanuel said he made rebuilding the L a priority and expended the necessary political capital to make it happen. He even takes the L to work a couple of times a week.\u201cPlanes and trains are called a choke point for a reason,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t do it, you choke.\u201dChicago\u2019s leaders have been dogged \u2014 and unusually creative \u2014 in finding ways to pay for the L. As state funding dried up in tight budget times, they worked together to mine new sources. They brought in about $1.5 billion in new federal grants and low-interest loans.Mr. Emanuel, former chief of staff for President Barack Obama, tapped into his Washington connections, even turning up in person to lobby federal transportation officials.Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, a Democrat, led an effort in 2012 to create a federal program to provide money for improving existing transit systems. Chicago was first in line, with a $957 million grant for the Red and Purple Lines. (New York has also applied for money from the program.)This year, Mr. Emanuel and the Chicago City Council increased a per-ride fee on ride-hailing services by 15 cents to raise money for track maintenance and safety upgrades.\u201cYou have this unity of purpose,\u201d said Robert E. Paaswell, a former executive director of the C.T.A. \u201cChicago is almost like a small town and everyone feels the L is really critical.\u201dMany cities are struggling to modernize aging, but vital, rail systems. Nationwide, there is an $89.9 billion backlog of unfunded infrastructure projects to keep rail and bus systems in a \u201cstate of good repair,\u201d according to the Federal Transit Administration.In the Philadelphia area, transit officials started a rebuilding program in 2013 after warning of drastic service cuts. They have doubled their annual infrastructure spending to nearly $750 million this year, including rebuilding tracks and stations, modernizing signals and adopting new technology like real-time travel alerts.San Francisco voters approved a $3.5 billion bond in 2016 to overhaul the Bay Area Rapid Transit system, from replacing worn track and rebuilding power lines to repairing tunnels and renovating stations. But that covers only part of the $17.6 billion needed over the next 15 years, transit officials said.While New York and Chicago share similar problems, there are big differences, too.New York\u2019s subway system is far bigger and more complex \u2014 as are its infrastructure challenges. In 2017, there were 1.7 billion subway rides in New York, or more than seven times the 230.2 million rides in Chicago.New York has 472 stations and 665 miles of track. Chicago has 145 stations and 224 miles of track, about half of it on elevated structures or embankments. New York\u2019s subway never closes. Six of Chicago\u2019s eight lines shut down in the early morning hours.The L is improving, by most measures. The average number of major delays every month \u2014 trains stopped on the track for at least 10 minutes because of mechanical issues \u2014 dropped to 78 in 2017, from 92 in 2011.A younger fleet of 1,460 rail cars has meant fewer breakdowns, with cars traveling 8,525 miles between breakdowns in 2017, up from 3,732 miles in 2011.Riders have returned. The L logged a record 241.7 million rides in 2015 \u2014 the highest in city records \u2014 from 190.3 million rides in 2007.Even so, the Chicago Transit Authority still has a $12 billion backlog of projects that is only growing because its infrastructure is \u201cdeteriorating rapidly,\u201d according to Stephen E. Schlickman, a transportation consultant.City leaders have also called for extending the Red Line nine miles into transit deserts on the city\u2019s far South Side.\u201cUnfortunately, many Chicagoans live and work in neighborhoods that lack access to Chicago\u2019s hub-and-spoke rail network,\u201d said Kyle Whitehead, a spokesman for the Active Transportation Alliance, an advocacy group.On trains and platforms around Chicago, many riders said the trains were finally running the way they were supposed to.Kevyn Christopher, 28, a chef, said he no longer has to worry about always being late. He once dozed off on a stalled train, only to wake up 45 minutes later in the same place. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot better now,\u201d he said.Some riders did complain that the widespread construction to remake the L has been just as disruptive as the breakdowns. \u201cI\u2019ve been stuck on the tracks numerous times in the last couple years and it really makes me mad,\u201d said Nikolina Apieczonek, 28, who has lost pay because she was late to work.Still, Charles Paidock, 69, a transit advocate, said the promise of an improved L made the inconveniences more bearable.\u201cIt\u2019s things that have to be fixed,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m glad it\u2019s being done and not just being neglected.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Pensions Get Bolder in Challenging Private Equity on Investments\u2019 Human Cost", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPrivate equity firms and public pension funds have long had a symbiotic relationship: The funds supply the firms with billions of dollars to invest, and the firms deliver double-digit returns that help the funds support retired public servants.Now, pension leaders are showing a new willingness to confront private equity over the human impact of its investments.Pension officials said the moves were sound investment decisions that were not driven by politics. Major layoffs at companies owned by private equity firms can hurt local economies, where pensions are broadly invested. A harassment scandal could damage a private equity firm\u2019s reputation and, by extension, a pension fund\u2019s investment.Pensions have long shunned investments unpopular with the people they represent, often in broad categories like guns and fossil fuels. But in recent years, pension holders\u2019 concerns have gotten more specific, and calls for the funds to take stands have increased.\u201cWe are having more contact with the public about these types of issues,\u201d said Adam Liebtag, the acting chairman of the New Jersey State Investment Council. \u201cThey are paying closer attention. They are following the money.\u201dNew Jersey is a hotbed for social concerns over pension investments. In addition to voting to more closely monitor firms under the moratorium on foreclosures in Puerto Rico, the state recently pulled money out of a private equity firm that had acquired a so-called payday lender.\u201cIt\u2019s a balancing act every time these situations arise,\u201d Mr. Liebtag said.The attitudes expressed by private equity investors are also attracting scrutiny.In June, John Russell, vice chairman of the Oregon Investment Council, said sexist remarks that David Bonderman, a TPG founder, had made in his capacity as an Uber board member were \u201cpart of the behavior that basically crippled the brand.\u201dA TPG spokesman said in a statement that the firm was \u201ccommitted to being a leader in advancing diversity and inclusion in the industry.\u201dToday, about 35 percent of private equity\u2019s money comes from public pensions, according to Preqin, a data firm.Not wanting to alienate their funding sources further, private equity firms seem willing to concede on social issues, pension experts say.\u201cThe last thing private equity wants to do is screw this up,\u201d said Ashby Monk, executive director of the Stanford Global Projects Center, which focuses on financial research.The shift coincides with a growing awareness among workers that they can exert influence through public pension boards, where many of the members making investment decisions represent labor unions.\u201cWorkers don\u2019t want their pension money invested in ways that hurt other workers,\u201d said Sarah Bloom Raskin, a fellow at Duke University and a deputy Treasury secretary in the Obama administration.\u201cNo one wants to be invested in their own decline,\u201d she said.The collapse of Toys \u201cR\u201d Us has earned private equity particularly widespread criticism. The former owners had loaded the retailer up with $5 billion in debt, which helped push it into bankruptcy in September 2017.The workers said they were unable to get through to the private equity firms, so they switched tack. Over the next three months, they traveled to investment meetings of 14 pension funds in 12 states.The employees were organized by the activist groups Rise Up Retail and the Private Equity Stakeholder Project, which was started last year.\u201cThere is a well-developed ecosystem of groups that focus on the practices of public companies,\u201d said Jim Baker, the Stakeholder Project\u2019s executive director. \u201cBut it\u2019s a limited field around private equity.\u201dThe Stakeholder Project, which is partly financed by labor unions, has focused on private equity\u2019s ownership of for-profit colleges, bail bond companies and the private prison industry. The group argued that Toys \u201cR\u201d Us workers deserved a portion of the financing and management fees the private equity firms collected from the retailer.The workers scored a big victory in Minnesota when Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, and the chairman of the state pension board led the effort to suspend further investments with K.K.R. in June.In Washington State, pension officials publicly questioned a top K.K.R. executive, asking if anyone had lost his or her job at the firm over the Toys \u201cR\u201d Us bankruptcy or had gotten a cut in pay. One pension board member suggested that the firm had a \u201cmoral obligation\u201d to set up a fund to help the workers. The K.K.R. executive, pointing out that the firm had lost money in the bankruptcy, apologized to the pension board.Michelle Perez of Vancouver, Wash., was among those laid off when Toys \u201cR\u201d Us closed. Ms. Perez, 28, said she had spoken to officials with pension funds about the difficulty she faced as a single mother trying to find a new job, without severance to provide any cushion.\u201cWe are getting listened to,\u201d she said.The toy store workers also made their case to pension funds that invest with Bain.By late summer, their efforts had begun to bear fruit: K.K.R. and Bain agreed to contribute up to $20 million between them to a hardship fund for the workers, although the final amount and terms had not been set, according to people briefed on the matter. Both firms declined to comment.Last month, Minnesota lifted the suspension on future K.K.R. investments after learning that the firm had agreed to contribute to the hardship fund.Vornado has not indicated that it planned to participate, according to the workers\u2019 group.

{"Headline": "Want to Punish Saudi Arabia? Cut Off Its Weapons Supply", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTrump says the U.S. gets \u201cmassive amounts\u201d of money selling arms to Riyadh. It\u2019s not true. Mr. Caverley is an expert in the global arms trade and American military aid.More than a week after Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian journalist, commentator and intellectual disappeared inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the United States is starting to realize it may be time to hold the government in Riyadh accountable for its reckless behavior and its violations of human rights. If American officials really want to encourage a change in Saudi policy, they should begin by looking at Saudi Arabia\u2019s largest imports from the United States: weaponry. Cutting off the flow of American arms to Saudi Arabia would be an effective way to put pressure on Riyadh with little cost to the American economy or national security.To date these sales have not \u201cstewarded our national security.\u201d Beyond its tragic war in Yemen, Saudi Arabia has blockaded Qatar, an ally that hosts the Middle East\u2019s largest American military base. And Saudi Arabia provides little help when it comes to Washington\u2019s real regional priorities, such as fighting the Islamic State and stabilizing Iraq. The Pentagon\u2019s National Defense Strategy specifically de-emphasizes the war on terror to focus on competition with China and Russia.Saudi Arabia is in the middle of a major war, and more than 60 percent of its arms deliveries over the past five years came from the United States. The Saudi military relies not just on American tanks, planes and missiles but for a daily supply of maintenance, training and support, such as intelligence and refueling. In the longer term, almost all of Saudi Arabia\u2019s remaining exports come from Europe. To truly squeeze Saudi Arabia, a coordinated embargo \u2014 much like the one now in place against Russia \u2014 would be necessary but relatively easy. European governments already feel strong domestic political pressure not to export to regimes like Saudi Arabia.Transforming the Saudi military to employ Russian, much less Chinese, weapons would cost a fortune even by Gulf standards, would require years of retraining and would greatly reduce its military power for a generation. Russia cannot produce next-generation fighter aircraft, tanks and infantry fighting vehicles for its own armed forces, much less for the export market. China has not produced, never mind exported, the sophisticated aircraft and missile defense systems Saudi Arabia wants.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Canadians on New Trade Deal: \u2018Do Not Consider the Friendship Resurrected\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhile President Trump hailed a \u201cbrand new deal,\u201d some Canadian readers say they felt bullied into a trade agreement.If you hold a gun to the head of your much smaller and weaker neighbor to force him to give you a few more apples off his tree, and he complies, I guess you could call that \u201csuccess.\u201dBut no one would call it a reasonable negotiation between friendly neighbors. Let\u2019s be very clear about that.This is a bad agreement for Canada. We gave up far too much while the Americans gave up nothing of consequence. We failed to capitalize on Donald Trump\u2019s vulnerability and succumbed to his bullying.We too suffer from bad leadership. Trudeau has made a habit of posturing on issues that are important to Canadians. Then he does exactly the opposite.The U.S. won\u2019t find a fairer trading partner than Canada. The numbers verify this.Canada won\u2019t forget the bully tactics and incivility of Trump, et al., in these (supposed) negotiations. Thanks, \u201cfriend.\u201d[Alan Rappeport, a Times reporter, answered questions about the new trade deal among the United States, Mexico and Canada.]I\u2019m a Canadian and a U.S. permanent resident working in the U.S.I feel like the trade deal is a win-win situation, although the U.S. benefits more, and Trump got a big win.Sure, Canada would have preferred the status quo with Nafta, and it would have gotten that with any other U.S. president (Republican or Democrat). But by signing this deal, Canada has avoided a recession, which Trump could certainly have caused with a stroke of his pen. For Trump, he secured some important things. None earth-shattering, but he basically got something for nothing, so it\u2019s no doubt a win.So I am glad that our negotiators stuck to their guns on those two things.Also, I think the rules regarding the autoworkers will be good for both the Canadian and American autoworkers.There were some concessions from Canada on dairy products, but we are talking about a less than 4 percent concession, and I think Canadian consumers might find a way to buy Canadian whenever possible.In the end, given that a \u201cno deal\u201d situation would have been devastating for a lot of businesses on both sides of our border, I think it made sense to sign the deal.Not a lot has changed except for the name. The dispute resolution mechanism still remains intact and the United States is not getting any additional access to Canadian dairy than they would have received under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The U.S. could have had this 18 months ago.Sorry, American friends, but Trump only replaced Nafta with Nafta and caused strained relations with his neighbors. As a Canadian whose career has been tied to the automotive industry for years, the future of Nafta has always been top of mind. After all the bluster, what has Trump achieved? Virtually nothing that wasn\u2019t already agreed in the aborted T.P.P. agreement negotiated by the previous administration. The access to the dairy market was already done. Trump may think that a new name makes it a new deal, but this excuse for an administration has wasted two years to disrupt everything, and achieve nothing. The agreement is largely a refresh of a 25-year-old pact that has brought together the economies of Canada, Mexico and the United States but had become somewhat outdated in the digital age.Trump can call it a triumph if he wants, but for all his huffing and puffing and threatening to blow the house down, the essentials of Nafta, a.k.a. to his base as \u201cthe worst deal for America ever,\u201d remain intact. Do not consider the friendship resurrected. The feeling up here is that Canadians will not soon forget the treatment from our supposed ally. We are a small nation that will never have much of an impact on the U.S. economy, however there is a collective \u201csour taste\u201d left in the mouths of many Canadians.People here will buy what they like, but there is this sensibility now that we shouldn\u2019t unquestioningly support the U.S. like we used to do. The U.S.A. has gone from friend to just neighbor in the minds of many Canadians. It will take a generation or so for that to wear off.Concluding a trade agreement is usually an occasion to affirm and celebrate friendship between nations. This one feels more like a nonaggression pact. More like stable wariness than genuine friendship.Marie Tae McDermott contributed reporting. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump Embraces Foreign Aid to Counter China\u2019s Global Influence", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPresident Trump, seeking to counter China\u2019s growing geopolitical influence, is embracing a major expansion of foreign aid that will bankroll infrastructure projects in Africa, Asia and the Americas \u2014 throwing his support behind an initiative he once sought to scuttle.Now, Mr. Trump wants to fight fire with fire.\u201cI\u2019ve changed, and I think he\u2019s changed, and it is all about China,\u201d said Representative Ted Yoho, Republican of Florida, who helped sell the plan to other conservative Republicans in the House Freedom Caucus, which has historically opposed foreign aid programs.\u201cMy whole impetus in running for Congress in the first place was to get rid of foreign aid. It was my thing,\u201d said Mr. Yoho, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific. \u201cBut if we can reformulate and modernize it, yeah, I have no problem with that. There are people who want to do this for humanitarian aid, fine. There are people like me who want to do this for national security, like me, fine.\u201dEvery Asian country now trades more with China than with the United States, often by a factor of two to one. Here\u2019s how the outlines of the rivalry are defining the future of the continent.China\u2019s biggest investments are targeted to countries, like Pakistan and Nigeria, with a goal of expanding Beijing\u2019s geopolitical power and gaining access to natural resources like minerals and oil. But it is also spending billions on projects in smaller countries that are less likely to turn a monetary or political profit. Last month, President Xi Jinping said China would provide $60 billion in financial support to Africa, including credit lines, grants and investment financing.The investments have raised concerns that poor and emerging nations like Djibouti and Sri Lanka could be increasingly beholden to China, which can seize local assets if countries default on loans.\u201cThe whole point of China\u2019s activity is building things no one else wanted to build \u2014 rail lines between African countries that hate each other, roads in bad terrain, power plants that are never going to make any money,\u201d said Derek M. Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who studies the Chinese and Indian economies.\u201cIf a country can\u2019t pay, they will take assets they want,\u201d he added. \u201cBut they aren\u2019t setting a debt trap. This is about expanding their reach and exercising passive power.\u201dThe United States\u2019 initiative is far less ambitious. But it \u201callows us, at least, to compete,\u201d said Tom Hart, North America executive director of ONE, the development nonprofit that the musician Bono helped found.The new $60 billion aid program was tucked into a five-year reauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration and its passage was the product of a quiet, bipartisan effort. It included ONE, the Brookings Institution, conservative House members like Mr. Yoho and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. It was led by Ray Washburne, the president of O.P.I.C. and a top Republican fund-raiser from Texas.O.P.I.C., like most other foreign development agencies, has come under heavy fire from the right, which has argued that such assistance is a waste of federal resources and a form of corporate welfare. During President Barack Obama\u2019s second term, the Republican-controlled House balked at reauthorizing the agency.During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to \u201cstop sending aid to countries that hate us.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m astonished, to be honest. I still can\u2019t believe we got it done,\u201d said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on this since 2015. It is basically the same proposal we had under the Obama administration. We rebranded to focus it on China.\u201dThe agency contains new accountability measures and includes reporting requirements to prevent gender discrimination and the use of child labor, but it is otherwise similar to its predecessor.Shortly after being picked as budget director last year, Mick Mulvaney \u2014 with the president\u2019s enthusiastic support \u2014 proposed slashing the State Department\u2019s foreign aid budget by one-third, a plan that zeroed out O.P.I.C.\u2019s budget.Soft power has, however, proved hard to kill.Congressional Republicans rejected Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s cuts. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo fought Mr. Mulvaney\u2019s attempts to claw back $3 billion in foreign aid spending this year, telling Mr. Trump that the cuts would weaken the country\u2019s position in the world and his own standing with the department\u2019s pro-foreign-aid career staff, according to two administration officials with knowledge of the exchanges.In the end, Mr. Yoho sold Mr. Mulvaney on supporting the expansion of the investment fund, arguing that its expansion would probably cost taxpayers nothing.Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, emphasized that the initiative represented a strategic shift. Mr. Trump seems to be learning that the projections of military power alone will not be enough to compete with China, he said.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing what China is doing throughout Africa and South America, especially Venezuela, and people are waking up and realizing we have to have involvement with the countries, not just for a return on investment, but to move them toward a market-based approach,\u201d said Mr. Corker, a Tennessee Republican who is not running for re-election. \u201cSo much of our foreign policy now is focused on trying to check China, especially their nefarious activities.\u201dA bigger question is whether it will do anything to reduce China\u2019s global influence.\u201cI\u2019m pretty skeptical,\u201d Mr. Scissors said. \u201cThe whole concept is that we give more money to big players who make investments in places where they don\u2019t lose money. We\u2019ve finessed the public relations problem. But we aren\u2019t really competing with the Chinese.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Private Businesses Built Modern China. Now the Government Is Pushing Back.", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldHONG KONG \u2014 The comments were couched in careful language, but the warning about China\u2019s direction was clear.\u201cThe phenomenon,\u201d Mr. Wu said, \u201cis worth noting.\u201dMr. Wu gave rare official voice to a growing worry among Chinese entrepreneurs, economists and even some government officials: China may be stepping back from the free-market, pro-business policies that transformed it into the world\u2019s No. 2 economy. For 40 years, China has swung between authoritarian Communist control and a freewheeling capitalism where almost anything could happen \u2014 and some see the pendulum swinging back toward the government.The debate has gone all the way to the top. On Thursday, President Xi Jinping, the country\u2019s leader, sought to reassure private entrepreneurs that Beijing would still support them. But he also offered a full-throated defense of the country\u2019s big state-controlled companies, which many economists believe crowd out private businesses.\u201cSuch statements as \u2018there should be no state-owned enterprises\u2019 and \u2018we should have smaller-scale state-owned enterprises\u2019 are wrong and slanted,\u201d Mr. Xi said during a visit to a facility owned by China National Petroleum Corporation, a major state-controlled oil company.Today, the private sector contributes nearly two-thirds of the country\u2019s growth and nine-tenths of new jobs, according to the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, an official business group. So pressures on private businesses could create serious ripples.Leftist scholars, bloggers and government officials are providing theoretical and practical support. In January, Zhou Xincheng, a professor of Marxism at Renmin University in Beijing, declared that private ownership should be eliminated.Last month, Wu Xiaoping, then an unknown blogger, wrote that the private sector should be ended now that it had accomplished its historic mission of achieving growth. Mr. Wu\u2019s blog went viral.Also last month, Qiu Xiaoping, a vice minister of human resources and social security, urged \u201cdemocratic management\u201d of private enterprises, saying that they should be jointly run by business owners and their employees.But entrepreneurs say the pace of change in Chinese taxes \u2014 already among the world\u2019s highest \u2014 gives them little time to prepare. For example, next year China will step up efforts to collect social-benefit payments and shift the way they are calculated, resulting in higher costs. Stricter social security tax collections could erode China\u2019s corporate profits by 2.5 percent, according to Lu Ting, an economist at Nomura Securities in Hong Kong.That could particularly hurt smaller companies, which tend to be privately owned and often have thin profit margins. Chinese officials have promised to cut overall taxes, but the details have been scant.Some struggling entrepreneurs are doing what was once considered unthinkable: selling out to the state. So far this year, 46 private companies have agreed to sell shares to state-controlled firms, with more than half selling controlling stakes, according to the Shanghai Securities News, an official government newspaper. While the number is small considering the vast Chinese economy, it reverses a two-decade trend of state companies selling shares to private entrepreneurs.One was the Changchun Sinoenergy Corporation, an oil and gas company. Its controlling shareholders agreed to sell their stakes to a company run by the government of Hunan Province after a loan was called. The government has pledged to inject nearly $150 million into the company.China has also taken steps to gain greater control over its technology sector, which flourished largely free from government influence.The authorities have also tightened rules governing online commerce. A new law requires those who run online stores to register with the government and pay taxes. That could hit Alibaba Group, also one of the world\u2019s largest internet companies, because it runs an online bazaar, called Taobao, where merchants big and small have opened thousands of digital stores. In a statement, Alibaba said it hoped the introduction of the new law would bring positive development to the industry.Private entrepreneurs are loath to speak out for fear of attracting official condemnation. But signs of distress aren\u2019t hard to find.Optimists point to expressions of concern from China\u2019s top leadership as an indicator that the government will give businesses more room. Others believe the tougher environment will stay. Xiao Han, an associate law professor in Beijing, cited one of Aesop's fables, of a man trying and failing to stop a donkey from going over a cliff.\u201cBefore long,\u201d Mr. Xiao said, \u201cwe\u2019ll probably find a body of a China donkey under the cliff.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump\u2019s Travel Choices, Kamala Harris in Florida, Biden to Ohio: 8 Days to Go", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWelcome to The Tip Sheet, a daily political analysis of the 2018 elections, based on interviews with Republican and Democratic officials, pollsters, strategists and voters.In most times of national tragedy, an American president usually shelves political events, curtails partisan rhetoric and tries to unify the country. Donald J. Trump is not that president.He went through with his regularly scheduled political rally in Illinois Saturday, only hours after the massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue, and he has a full schedule of campaign events for the final week before Election Day.Mr. Trump may go to Pittsburgh \u2014 he will not be on the campaign trail Monday or Tuesday \u2014 but he has made clear he will not pause for long from political combat:\u2022 He took to Twitter Sunday to call the liberal donor Tom Steyer, who was targeted with a pipe bomb last week, a \u201ccrazy and stumbling lunatic.\u201d\u2022 He also said \u201cFake & Dishonest reporting\u201d was damaging the country.It\u2019s Trump-as-usual, but it\u2019s the sort of conduct that alarms Republican strategists because it turns off the remaining up-for-grabs voters the party needs to survive in a series of House and governors\u2019 races. Republicans are in fighting shape in many Senate contests, but their 23-seat majority in the House and their hold on governorships in Illinois, Michigan and Florida are at real risk.And given the recent violence, his language at the upcoming rallies will draw intense scrutiny \u2014 the sort of attention that had dissipated somewhat until one Trump supporter sent the pipe bombs to the president\u2019s favorite foes and another man killed 11 congregants in a synagogue.The math currently favors the Democrats in the House and the Republicans in the Senate.Details about the president\u2019s tentative pre-election schedule leaked Sunday night and they are very revealing. A few thoughts:\u2022 After making several stops for House candidates in recent weeks, the president is mostly focused on Senate and gubernatorial races \u2014 and is clearly aiming to help his party add to its one-seat Senate majority.\u2022 To the delight of Montana Republicans, Mr. Trump will return to their state a final time to try to knock off Senator Jon Tester. Polls show Mr. Tester with a small edge.\u2022 And in a sign that the president is eager to tend to the nation\u2019s largest swing state, where his handpicked nominee for governor is struggling, Mr. Trump will appear twice in Florida during the final week of the campaign: first in Ft. Myers on Wednesday and then in Pensacola on Saturday.Mr. Trump and his top political advisers want to claim credit for winning as many House races as they can \u2014 so that even if Republicans lose the chamber, the White House can point to a series of conservative-leaning districts he appeared in to argue that he saved as many races as he cost his party.It is no surprise that Mr. Trump would rather not dwell on the gun massacre and pipe bombs as the election season closes. What may be more striking: Democrats don\u2019t either, necessarily.\u2022 \u201cIt\u2019s about the economy, it\u2019s about health care, it\u2019s about what we need to do around paying attention to voting rights, what we need to do to pay attention to student loan debt,\u201d Senator Kamala Harris of California told reporters in Florida on Sunday, during a day of events for her colleague from that state, Senator Bill Nelson, and Andrew Gillum, the Tallahassee mayor running for governor. \u201cThat\u2019s where we should all be focused.\u201dStill, some Democrats have sought a kind of balance: dinging Mr. Trump without appearing to escalate a partisan conflict. Take Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a Democrat running to unseat Representative Carlos Curbelo, the Republican incumbent in Florida\u2019s 26th District.\u2022 Asked in an interview whether Mr. Trump was responsible for the political violence, she criticized the \u201cracial comments, sexist comments\u201d from the president throughout his political career, accusing him of \u201cigniting hatred.\u201d\u2022 But she stopped a beat short of implicating Mr. Trump directly. \u201cI\u2019m not going to blame him directly, obviously,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I don\u2019t want to continue the divide.\u201dJoe Biden has long prided himself on being a Democrat who can campaign anywhere. His itinerary in the midterms\u2019 closing days seems designed in part to reinforce the point.Later in the week, Mr. Biden is expected to appear in a state even more hostile to Democrats in recent memory: North Dakota.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.So why go? Loyalty, for one.

It\u2019s about bigotry.That\u2019s the real story \u2014 to the extent there is a story at all \u2014 about the caravan of 5,000 impoverished Central Americans rampaging toward the United States border at, er, two miles an hour.So, here\u2019s some perspective, by my back-of-envelope calculations:More than 1.4 million foreigners immigrate to the United States each year. If, say, half the caravan reaches the border, and half of those people actually enter the U.S., they would represent less than one-tenth of 1 percent of this year\u2019s immigrants.If the caravan proceeds by foot, during the period of its journey 16,800 Americans will die from drugs.In the period of the caravan\u2019s journey, perhaps 690,000 Americans will become homeless, including 267,000 children.In the period of the caravan\u2019s journey, 8,850 Americans will die from guns, including suicides and murders. In the period of the caravan\u2019s journey, perhaps 9,000 Americans will die from lack of health insurance (people die at higher rates when they\u2019re uninsured, although there\u2019s disagreement about how much higher).Maybe the real \u201cNational Emergy\u201d is drugs, homelessness, gun deaths and lack of health insurance?In the 2014 elections, Republican candidates ran hundreds of ads denouncing the Obama administration\u2019s handling of Ebola. News organizations chronicled this \u201cdebate,\u201d but in retrospect they were manipulated into becoming a channel to spread fear \u2014 and win Republican votes.Politically, this was quite effective, and Republicans won sweeping gains across the country and seized control of the Senate. Yet Ebola, like the Central American caravan, is a reminder of the distinction between grandstanding and governing.Obama\u2019s technocratic Ebola program \u2014 working with France and Britain, plus private aid groups \u2014 may have worried voters, but it was effective. Instead of careening around the world to kill millions and devastate the global economy, the Ebola virus was contained and eventually burned out. Good governance often turns out to be bad politics, and vice versa.The same is true of immigration.I fear that we in the media have become Trump\u2019s puppets, letting him manipulate us to project issues like the caravan onto the agenda.Trump is right that, although there\u2019s no evidence of it, \u201cthere could very well be\u201d Middle Easterners hiding in the caravan. It\u2019s equally true that the Easter Bunny \u201ccould very well be\u201d in the caravan. Speaking of Easter, Jesus Christ \u201ccould very well be\u201d in the caravan.So let\u2019s stop freaking out about what \u201ccould very well be\u201d and focus on facts. Here are two: First, the Caravan won\u2019t make a bit of difference to America. Second, we have other problems to focus on, from drugs to homelessness to health care, that genuinely constitute a \u201cNational Emergy.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "With 8 Years of Job Gains, Unemployment Is Lowest Since 1969", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe unemployment rate fell to a nearly five-decade low in September, punctuating a remarkable rebound in the 10 years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off a global financial crisis.The latest milestone came in a Friday report from the Labor Department: The unemployment rate fell to 3.7 percent last month, the lowest since December 1969, when hundreds of thousands of working-age Americans were serving in Vietnam.\u201cI view this as the strongest labor market in a generation,\u201d said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at the career site Glassdoor. \u201cThese really are the good times.\u201dThe turnaround from a decade ago is hard to overstate. In September 2008, American employers cut 443,000 jobs as the financial system collapsed around them. More than seven million more jobs evaporated in the months that followed. Even when the hemorrhaging stopped, shellshocked executives were slow to bring back laid-off workers, sparking fears of a \u201cjobless recovery.\u201dBut when the hiring engine finally kicked back into gear, it did so in historic fashion. The 134,000 jobs added in September made it the 96th consecutive month of growth \u2014 eight full years, double the previous record. Employers have added close to 20 million jobs during that streak. (September\u2019s growth, a modest slowdown from August, would probably have been stronger absent the effects of Hurricane Florence, which struck the Carolinas in the middle of the month.)Republicans are hoping the strong economy will help them hold off a potential \u201cblue wave\u201d of Democratic victories in next month\u2019s midterm elections. Friday\u2019s report was one of the last before Election Day, and President Trump wasted no time before cheering the news on Twitter.Indeed, the decade-long economic rebound from the financial crisis has been impressive more for its durability than for its strength. Millions of Americans remain stuck in part-time or temporary work, and many of the middle-class jobs wiped out by the recession have never returned. As a share of the population, employment remains well below its 2000 peak, a gap only partly explained by the aging population.Most significant, strong hiring has not yet translated into robust raises for many workers. Average hourly earnings rose 2.8 percent in September from a year earlier, down from 2.9 percent in August and well below the growth that economists would usually expect with the unemployment rate this low.But there are signs that wage growth could at long last be gaining momentum. Before last month\u2019s hiccup, the pace of growth had been drifting upward. Industries where labor is especially tight, such as construction and technology, are seeing wages rise faster.Amy Glaser, a senior vice president at the staffing firm Adecco, heard the Amazon news on television while preparing for a meeting with a rival e-commerce firm. Ms. Glaser helps companies hire for the holiday season, a task that Amazon had just made even more difficult for them.\u201cThere was definitely a feeling of concern,\u201d she said. \u201cIt puts increased pressure on them in a market where they already knew they were going to have to make significant adjustments on wages.\u201dHigher pay alone may not be enough. The combination of a tight labor market and rapidly growing online sales has made the competition for warehouse workers particularly fierce this year. Ms. Glaser said companies were hiring earlier, easing job requirements and giving workers more control over their schedules, a big shift in an industry that has traditionally expected workers to show up when and where they are needed.\u201cThe demand for workers is higher than ever, and the supply just isn\u2019t out there right now,\u201d Ms. Glaser said.Christine Specht is dealing with just that challenge. Ms. Specht runs Cousins Subs, a Wisconsin sandwich chain that is struggling to find workers as it looks to expand into the Chicago area.Cousins has raised wages in recent years but still pays well under the $15 an hour that Amazon and other big companies are promising. As the operator of a small chain in a competitive industry, Ms. Specht said, she is reluctant to raise prices in order to pay employees more.\u201cWe can\u2019t always run to the menu board every time there\u2019s a cost increase in running our business,\u201d Ms. Specht said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of a last resort.\u201dInstead, the company is looking for other ways to attract workers. Cousins has ramped up its training program to help workers advance into management, offered referral bonuses to employees who help recruit their friends and staged \u201chiring blitz days,\u201d when executives set up shop in a restaurant and interview candidates on the spot. More than anything, they are trying to move quickly.\u201cYou can\u2019t sit on applications anymore, because people have options and they will go somewhere else,\u201d Ms. Specht said.Many economists think the shortage of workers will cause job growth to slow in the months ahead. But others argue that there is still room for the labor pool to expand, as employers become willing to consider candidates they would have overlooked earlier and as higher wages attract people who had been choosing not to work.\u201cYou did see something like that in the late \u201990s, which is probably the closest analogue,\u201d said Jeremy Schwartz, an economist for Credit Suisse in New York. \u201cIn a sufficiently strong labor market, you really were pulling people from the sidelines.\u201dIt is unclear whether that can happen again. In the 1990s, baby boomers were in their prime working years; today, they are retiring at a rate of 10,000 a day. The number of people being hired from outside the labor force is near an all-time high. Yet the participation rate \u2014 the share of adults working or actively looking for work \u2014 has been essentially flat in recent years.\u201cYou do see prime-working-age individuals coming back into the labor force,\u201d said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics for Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cBut the demographic forces are so fierce that it provides a complete offset.\u201dPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve are watching warily for signs that the shrinking pool of labor is leading the economy to overheat, as competition for workers drives up wages and, ultimately, inflation. That could force the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly than planned, which could cause a recession.Yields on United States government bonds have risen sharply in recent days, a sign that investors expect inflation \u2014 and interest rates \u2014 to rise in coming years. Those concerns have also filtered through to the stock market, where major indexes fell again on Friday after dropping on Thursday.With the economy in such strong shape, attention on Wall Street has turned to what could bring the good times to an end. Fed rate increases are one popular answer. A trade war is another.Economists and business leaders have warned for months that Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs could threaten the recovery, particularly in manufacturing. There is little sign of that so far, however. That sector added 18,000 jobs in September, and the revised figures erased what was initially reported as a small decline in August. Other measures of the industrial sector likewise show continued growth.\u201cWe really don\u2019t have any negative impact from the tariffs yet,\u201d said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist for the consulting firm RSM.Advertisement"}

Here\u2019s what I learned.I had bedrooms in 10 different countries growing up. My parents are Pakistani diplomats, so my siblings and I have had an unconventional life. I was born in Egypt, and then lived in the United Arab Emirates, Pakistan, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Bangladesh, the United States and Germany, where I am now.Moving around so much makes me a \u201cThird Culture Kid,\u201d or TCK. The term was coined by sociologist Ruth Hill Useem in the 1950s to describe children who live in countries foreign to their parents, and thus occupy a position between the culture of their parents and the culture of the country in which they live.Ask most TCKs, and they\u2019ll say we\u2019re lucky. When you\u2019re forced to be the new kid at school enough times, you come up with an algorithm to fit in. It became second nature to lay low at first, discern the unspoken rules of the school, and then fake it to the best of my ability.When I first moved to the United States, I had a lot to learn. For one, I was used to wearing a uniform to school; now I had to pick an outfit everyday. Not wanting to appear different, I sat in the library on my first day and just kind of looked at people. (I quickly realized that athleisure was the way to go.)Like an ethnographer-in-training, I honed my observational skills over the years and became a cultural chameleon. You\u2019ll notice this in a lot of TCKs, the ability to negotiate between cultures and mediate between diverse groups of people. But every silver lining has a cloud.The longing I feel for cities and places is peculiar and gnawing. You can\u2019t text a city and tell her you miss her vibe. I have extensive memories of Ampang Park, a shopping mall near our condo in Malaysia. Thinking about the park triggers flashes of Archie comics, pirated DVDs, my first ever Red Hot Chili Peppers album, and the nasi goreng I\u2019d sometimes try to convince my dad to get on our way home from school. This year, they tore it down. I had tears in my eyes when I heard the news. When we left Kuala Lumpur, I told myself I\u2019d come back one day to the city that partially raised me, to my temporary home, to my Ampang Park. However, as I would learn, some goodbyes are more irrevocable than others.Looming above every new beginning was its ending. With every friend I made, I knew I\u2019d have to have a long-distance relationship at some point. Every time we unpacked, I wondered what I\u2019d be packing next time. Every time I entered an airport, I knew I\u2019d leave from the same place. Memory became precious, knowing that sometimes that\u2019s all I\u2019d have left of a place.While some TCKs lament the loss of a home, of stability, I feel like the perpetual state of transition taught me that one can have many homes. Sometimes you find home in people, and sometimes homes can be temporary. Now that I\u2019m in a gap year after college, headfirst in the throes of post-collegiate disillusionment, I see lessons from my life coming into play. Being in this state of limbo is difficult, but very familiar. Liminal spaces aren\u2019t so scary when you\u2019ve occupied them for most of your life. In fact, I feel right at home.Parvathy Bhushan, a recent graduate from Mount Holyoke College, sent us a problem to figure out:In college and immediately after, I started to build a professional network that would help me kick-start my career and that definitely helped me land my first job. What advice do folks have on sustaining and continuing to build their network? How do you keep in touch with your contacts so that when the time comes, it doesn't feel awkward to reach out to them for help?First of all, congratulations! You\u2019re tackling something that a lot of people don\u2019t pay enough attention to. Everyone should have a professional network, and instead of calling it that, I wish we all called it what it really is: \u201cfriends willing to help each other with work stuff.\u201dThat way, it gets a little easier to stay in touch without feeling awkward. With professional societies, there are conferences and meetings, pre-planned get-togethers you can just attend. With good friends, catching up feels good to do. Make it easy: hang out doing something of mutual interest, or just grab quick, low-intensity coffee together. 15 minutes, maybe 30, max. I have people in my network I\u2019d hang out with all evening laughing and talking, and others where a coffee to catch up is more than enough, and both are fine! Make it a recurring appointment on both of your calendars, maybe monthly, or even quarterly. Pick a spot you both love but don\u2019t get to visit as often as you\u2019d like.

Ward, waded into another one of their properties by a dock on the Apalachicola River. They found nearly chest-level water, higher than ever before, in the space where they clean seafood, and also in the downtown market where they sell it.Later in the week, the storm surge had receded, and the magnitude of work before them had started to become apparent.\u201cThis is our cooler, which I\u2019m not going to open because the fish are covered in river mud,\u201d T.J. Ward, 30, said as he walked through one of the buildings.Inside the seafood market, a freezer for imported products, including snow crab, lay tossed on its side, the floors slick and smelly.\u201cThat\u2019s $200,000, easy,\u201d Kevin Ward said as he grabbed a Coke out of a warm refrigerator.With the additional damage at the wholesale facility, his brother said, the overall losses would likely reach $400,000 to $500,000.The family had evacuated its larger, more lucrative shrimp on 18-wheelers before the storm, and its shrimping boats were safely upstream. But the smaller shrimp would be lost.\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose thousands of dollars worth of shrimp,\u201d T.J. said.And don\u2019t ask about the oysters.\u201cThe shrimp business is off and on, always,\u201d he said. \u201cThe oyster business has been really bad. Really bad.\u201dThere are so few wild oysters left that the Wards turned to oyster farming two years ago. They did not yet know the status of their 750,000 to one million farmed oysters after the storm.\u201cWe never thought it would\u2019ve been this bad,\u201d said Melanie Ward, T.J.\u2019s wife.Downtown Apalachicola, with its neatly painted storefronts, counted itself lucky, despite the surge of seawater that left debris strewn everywhere. Shops that had been boarded up with plywood showed minimal damage \u2014 a shattered window here, a watermark there. A county hospital that closed before the storm had a damaged roof. The bridge leading into town, proudly named after John Gorrie, the native son who helped pioneer air-conditioning, had reopened, though parts of it were limited to one lane and a sign warned, \u201cDrive at your own risk!\u201dAcross the bay in Eastpoint, Apalachicola\u2019s more modest neighbor, where the slogan is \u201cOysters since 1898,\u201d parts of scenic U.S. Highway 98 looked like a ghost town, the sand-swept road lined with mountains of wood where bayside shacks had stood before the storm. Eastpoint, at the foot of a state forest named Tate\u2019s Hell, had already endured tragedy this year, when a wildfire caused by an out-of-control prescribed burn burned down 30 homes.When that happened, Apalachicola restaurateurs got together and fed their downtrodden neighbors. On Thursday, the cooks joined forces again, this time for a cookout in Apalachicola. Under makeshift tents outside Tamara\u2019s Caf\u00e9, they set up gas-powered grills and brought out food that would otherwise spoil in their powerless kitchens.Out came ground beef, and three people formed an assembly line for burger patties. There were meatballs and red sauce, so there would be pasta. Marisa Getter fetched a container of salt and pepper for her husband, Danny Itzkovitz, as he sweated over the grill.Sejal Patel, 37, who runs the local Best Western, said even neighbors who had left under evacuation orders were reaching out \u2014 on the rare occasion when cellphone service worked \u2014 to offer the contents of their own freezers from afar.\u201cPeople not in town are calling us and saying, \u2018Get this from my house!\u2019\u201d she said.First in line before the appointed 6 p.m. dinnertime was Ted Tripp, who said he rode out the storm on his sailboat. He looked like it, too, his face ruddy and body gaunt.\u201cI haven\u2019t had a hot meal in three days,\u201d he told Ms. Getter.His anchor picked up a cypress log, causing his boat to drift into the riverbank as the hurricane pushed in, Mr. Tripp said. \u201cIt was actually quite cozy.

{"Headline": "How Trump Should Address Unfair Trade With China ", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCorrecting currency misalignment, not imposing tariffs, should be his priority.Dr. Scott is an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a research organization.The president\u2019s tariff approach ignores a more significant problem \u2014 the currency misalignment of the dollar and the Chinese yuan \u2014 and so could end up doing more harm than good.Mr. Trump\u2019s presidential campaign sought to channel the anger of many Americans over unfair trade. I understand this anger, having documented in my research the millions of manufacturing jobs lost in the United States as a result of flawed trading relationships with China and Mexico. But rhetoric doesn\u2019t always equal insight, and the president\u2019s approach ignores two key facts.First, trade deals on their own don\u2019t have much potential to help America\u2019s workers. Contemporary trade agreements may be nominally concerned with rules and tariffs, but their primary outcome has been to tilt the playing field in favor of foreign investors, which merely continues a cycle of outsourced production. Tinkering at the margins, as evidenced by recent rewrites of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement and the North American Free Trade Agreement, alters mostly just the optics of trade policy. It sends a message that the president is \u201cbeing tough.\u201d But it\u2019s unlikely to have a meaningful impact.The second fact is that currency misalignment \u2014 not trade deals \u2014 is the single most important driver of growing United States trade deficits. From 1997 to 2014, China purchased $4 trillion in United States Treasury bills and other assets to bid up the value of the dollar relative to the Chinese yuan. (China sold some of its reserves in 2015 and 2016 to stabilize the yuan, but this year it again bought foreign assets to keep the yuan from rising.) This has made China\u2019s currency artificially cheap, creating what is effectively a huge subsidy for Chinese exports to the United States. It also imposes a de facto tax on all United States exports to China.Growing trade with low-wage countries like China has decimated the earnings of 100 million non-college-educated workers in the United States \u2014 two-thirds of the work force. And job losses have devastated entire regions of America\u2019s industrial heartland, especially in the upper Midwest. Not surprisingly, this includes some of the once reliably Democratic states that President Trump carried in the last election.Although China is no longer officially manipulating the value of its currency, the dollar remains significantly overvalued \u2014 in part because China is sitting on more than $3 trillion in foreign assets. The dollar is now overvalued by at least 25 to 30 percent against not just the Chinese yuan but also the Japanese yen and the euro. Notably, the dollar has risen further since Mr. Trump was elected, increasing roughly 6 percent in trade-weighted value since January 2018 alone, which further encumbers domestic manufacturers.Unfortunately, currency misalignment can\u2019t be fixed by updating trade deals. It\u2019s a global problem driven largely by continuing foreign demand for United States securities and financial assets. Since 2014, private foreign investment in American financial assets has increased the dollar\u2019s real, trade-weighted value by 20 percent. The dollar must be realigned against not just the Chinese yuan but also against the currencies of countries that have been running chronic trade surpluses for many years.Previous Republican presidents have taken steps to tackle an overvalued dollar. (In 1971, for example, Richard Nixon imposed a temporary import surcharge on all imports; it led to an agreement four months later to lower the dollar\u2019s value.) What\u2019s required is the political will to stand up to powerful actors like Walmart and Apple that benefit from continued currency misalignment. The president should apply leverage on America\u2019s trading partners \u2014 a fee on incoming foreign capital, tariff threats or coordinated currency intervention \u2014 to realign the dollar.Congress could try to force the president\u2019s hand, threatening to impose significant taxes on capital inflows to reduce demand for United States financial assets. But the authority to negotiate on currency rests in the hands of the executive. And until President Trump grasps the severity of the dollar problem, making a \u201cgreat deal\u201d on trade agreements will matter little for United States manufacturers.Robert E. Scott is a senior economist and the director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Economy Is Great, Really, for Now", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe excesses that could end a boom decade for the American economy are coming into view.Mr. Sharma, the author of \u201cThe Rise and Fall of Nations: Forces of Change in the Post-Crisis World,\u201d is a contributing opinion writer.Whatever one thinks of President Trump, it\u2019s hard to deny that much of America is feeling great again.Surveys show that consumers have been this confident only twice before, at the height of the economic booms of the 1960s and 1990s, and their mood is bright across income groups, not just among the rich. Small business confidence has not been higher since the surveys began nearly five decades ago. The misery index, invented in the 1970s to describe the agonizing combination of inflation and unemployment, is now just 6 percent, matching the lowest levels of the last half century.Investors may now be expecting America to peak after a hot decade. Even with recent setbacks, the performance gap between the United States stock market and the rest of the global markets is close to a 100-year high. Money flowing into the United States has also driven up the value of the dollar, which has never been more dominant as the world\u2019s preferred currency. Trump doubters say that this boom began before he took office, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008, and they have a point. With its more flexible economic system, the United States responded faster than its peers to the debt problems exposed by the crisis. The United States forced households and troubled financial institutions to rapidly reduce their debt, and easy money provided by the Federal Reserve allowed them to start spending again. Money flowed into the giant tech companies that have underpinned the American economic surge.Just as the 1980s belonged to Japan and the 2000s to emerging nations, the last decade belonged to America. Still, the gap in performance between America and the rest of the world has widened in the last two years under Mr. Trump, as his tax cuts and deregulation turbocharged the American economy and its markets. His policies have spurred consumption, and have incentivized companies to buy back more of their stock and bring home some of the money they had stashed overseas.But economies that are hot in one decade rarely stay hot in the next. Every boom eventually creates excesses that sow the seeds of its own destruction, and the excesses that could end the American decade are coming into view.The United States economy has been expanding for nine years in a row and if this streak carries on until August next year it will be the longest economic expansion in the country\u2019s history. Within a few years after the crisis of 2008, American companies had started running up debts again. It\u2019s not unusual for companies to get overconfident and become saddled with heavy debts late in an expansion. But it is unusual to see the government follow suit, as it has this time. Owing in part to the Trump tax cuts, the United States budget deficit is now around 4 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 the highest it has been outside the immediate aftermath of a recession or a war.That will make it very hard for the government to keep stimulating the economy. Growth is expected to slow next year as the impact of the tax cuts fades and the strong dollar cuts into exports. The Fed has been raising rates, and the end of the long easy money party is starting to have an impact on the housing and stock markets, helping to explain the recent correction.Nonetheless, the United States stock market is still swollen \u2014 and it seems unlikely to keep expanding from here. The stock market is now 60 percent larger than the American economy, a scale it has reached only twice in the past century, during the manias of the 1920s and late 1990s. Moreover, the giant tech companies that have been driving the economy and markets now face a regulatory backlash that could cut into their extraordinarily high profit margins.Trump haters may be tempted to conclude from all this that he is about to lead America into a sudden decline, but that is not the point. This American decade started under President Obama, continued under Mr. Trump and survived congressional gridlock throughout, showing that the economy often rises above politics. The economy is driven less by ideology than by its own internal cycles, and this cycle has been turning in America\u2019s favor for so long that it is unlikely to last much longer.While the excesses of corporate exuberance and government debt are rising in the United States, countries from France to Brazil are in the cleanup phase that often precedes an economic comeback. Most are a long way from working out the excesses of the last decade, and they may suffer further setbacks. But they are approaching the start of a new cycle, while the United States nears the end of an old one. If history is any guide, the next decade is less likely to be great for America than it is for the rest of the world.Advertisement"}

There\u2019s a good chance many of these products made their way to your home on the 140,000-mile network of U.S. rails.Each year, an integrated system of trains, trucks and barges ships 54 tons of goods for each American, according to the Association of American Railroads, supporting more than 1.5 million jobs and $274 billion in economic activity.\u201cAs the economy shifts online, rail transportation is playing a huge role behind the scenes to get goods to warehouses and to people\u2019s doorsteps,\u201d says Tom Schnautz, assistant vice president for advanced train control technology at Norfolk Southern, a railroad that in 2017 transported 7.6 million carloads of freight that reached nearly half of all Americans.\u2018As the economy shifts online, rail transportation is playing a huge role behind the scenes to get goods to warehouses and to people\u2019s doorsteps.\u2019TOM SCHNAUTZ | ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT FOR ADVANCED TRAIN CONTROL TECHNOLOGY AT NORFOLK SOUTHERN\u201cAs the economy shifts online, rail transportation is playing a huge role behind the scenes to get goods to warehouses and to people\u2019s doorsteps,\u201d says Tom Schnautz, assistant vice president for advanced train control technology at Norfolk Southern, a railroad that in 2017 transported 7.6 million carloads of freight that reached nearly half of all Americans.A growing economy will also further expand the number of critical goods transported on the American rail network. By 2040, the U.S. will see a 40 percent increase in national freight shipments, the Transportation Department predicts.To support this growth, Norfolk Southern is using automation, machine learning and predictive analytics to optimize its network \u2014 including 19,500 miles of track, nearly 63,000 freight cars and approximately 27,000 employees \u2014 so that people and machines can help shape the future of America\u2019s rail system.\u201cAutomation and big data analytics have allowed our rail employees to shift from being trouble finders to trouble fixers,\u201d Schnautz says. \u201cYou end up with a smoother operation, more predictability and better service for American businesses and consumers.\u201d\u2018A Single-Lane Highway With Multiple Streams of Traffic\u2019\u2018A Single-Lane Highway With Multiple Streams of Traffic\u2019To understand the need for new technologies, it helps to start with the modern railroad. The infrastructure is like a complex network of single-lane highways with multiple streams of traffic running in different directions, from long- and short-haul freight trains to commuter railroads to interstate passenger trains, says Warren Stubbs, director of information system development at Norfolk Southern. For safety purposes, only one train is allowed in a defined area of track at a given time, which means trains frequently have to pull over until given \u201ctrack authority\u201d to move ahead.The system works smoothly enough, until contingencies arise, which often happens in a network with tens of thousands of moving parts. And one small issue can cause a ripple effect. A cooling water leak on a locomotive near Knoxville, Tenn., for example, can cause a breakdown and force delays, railyard backups and train shortages from New Orleans to Columbus, Ohio.To achieve true visibility, Norfolk Southern built a system of systems: a lattice of artificially intelligent technologies that continuously collect data and use it to automate traditional processes and improve reliability.Schnautz isn\u2019t exaggerating when he likens managing Norfolk Southern\u2019s sprawling network (and its infinite variables) to playing a giant game of chess. To achieve true visibility, Norfolk Southern built a system of systems: a lattice of artificially intelligent technologies that continuously collect data and use it to automate traditional processes and improve reliability.Automating a 20,000-Mile NetworkAutomating a 20,000-Mile NetworkHere\u2019s how it all works. Imagine a Norfolk Southern train that\u2019s scheduled to travel to Atlanta from Chicago. Throughout its journey, engineers and operators need to track the train so it can maintain safe spacing and speeds. Positive Train Control, a new technology, continuously leverages sensors, GPS and on-board computing to analyze thousands of variables. Using this data, Positive Train Control can automatically stop the train before it exceeds safe speed limits or enters unauthorized areas of track.\u201cBy providing both a safety umbrella and a new stream of accurate location data,\u201d Stubbs says, \u201cPositive Train Control has allowed us to do more automation within our rail network.\u201dBut this train is just one of thousands running concurrently on Norfolk Southern\u2019s network. To efficiently move them across the rail system, Norfolk Southern designed another technology called Movement Planner, which combines Positive Train Control location data with thousands of other pieces of information to create a dynamic master plan. Using complex logic algorithms, Movement Planner synthesizes all the data every two minutes, continuously plotting and updating the most efficient and cost-effective routes for each train.\u201cMovement Planner is the dispatcher\u2019s helper,\u201d says Charlie Turnipseed, a former train dispatcher who\u2019s now system manager of dispatch operations at Norfolk Southern. \u201cIt allows them to use physics \u2014 not subjective human preferences \u2014 to determine the best route for every train across the entire network, even as variables change.\u201dThe optimal route for the Chicago to Atlanta train reaches the conductor through software called Auto Router, which translates Movement Planner\u2019s master plan into instructions for individual trains, streamlining the routing process and helping dispatchers focus on exceptions.As the Atlanta-bound train continues south, it looks for ways to automate its controls and reduce its fuel consumption. On board, an Energy Management computer continually calculates the train\u2019s optimal speed by analyzing conditions such as topography, track curvature and car weight. That information is fed into the train\u2019s Auto Control system, which automatically adjusts its throttle and brake \u2014 much like a car\u2019s adaptive cruise control.As the Atlanta-bound train continues south, it looks for ways to automate its controls and reduce its fuel consumption.

In 2017, automated innovations like Energy Management and Auto Control helped save fuel, with Norfolk Southern\u2019s trains consuming 30 million fewer gallons than they did in 2016. This enhanced operation also places less wear and tear on Norfolk Southern\u2019s expensive equipment.\u201cWhen you operate a train with fewer starts and stops, you place less stress on its equipment, which reduces its risk of failing,\u201d Schnautz says. \u201cThis gives our customers more reliability and predictability.\u201dInnovations like Positive Train Control and Auto Control have made self-driving locomotives like the Atlanta-bound freighter a reality, enhancing safety and efficiency and allowing American industry to move freight more reliably, Schnautz says.150,000 Predictive ModelsNorfolk Southern is also using A.I. and predictive analytics to diagnose infrastructure and equipment issues before they cause disruption. This has allowed the company to shift its maintenance programs from reactive triage to proactive upkeep.For example, the locomotive pulling the Chicago to Atlanta train contains an army of sensors designed to detect mechanical and electrical issues. Throughout the journey these sensors, as well as track and wayside monitors, send readings to Norfolk Southern\u2019s analytics systems, where data scientists have built and tested an array of models that can predict \u2014 with nearly 100 percent accuracy \u2014 cooling water leaks one week before they affect operations and locomotive battery failures a month in advance.Norfolk Southern can predict locomotive battery failures a month in advance.With this predictive intelligence, Norfolk Southern\u2019s network of locomotive shops is able to pull locomotives out of service before they break down, allowing maintenance teams to make repairs with minimal downtime, says Daniel White, manager of locomotive operations at Norfolk Southern. \u201cThere\u2019s a cascading effect of efficiencies that are gained by being able to use data to better judge a locomotive's reliability,\u201d he says.The data science group also studied rail patterns to build a model that can predict the need for rail replacement up to five years ahead of time. \u201cIn just six months, we were able to build more than 150,000 models that are individualized for every segment of rail in our network,\u201d says Mabby Amouie, senior manager of advanced analytics at Norfolk Southern. \u201cBeing able to plan rail maintenance with this specificity has allowed us to enhance safety, prevent delays and save millions of dollars.\u201dWhat\u2019s more, Norfolk Southern\u2019s maintenance models won\u2019t become outdated if a train or rail receives new components.

{"Headline": "A Momentous Election in Brazil: What\u2019s at Stake?", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Bolsonaro, 63, a former army captain, was first elected to Congress in 1991. During most of his legislative career, he was a marginal figure known for speaking nostalgically about the 1964-1985 military dictatorship and for making incendiary comments about women and minorities.But as the country\u2019s main political parties were swept up in a large-scale corruption investigation, known as Lava Jato, or Car Wash, Mr. Bolsonaro has pitched himself to voters as an anti-establishment maverick who will fight graft. And in a country traumatized by violent crime, his iron-fisted approach to law and order has appealed to voters in traditionally left-wing strongholds.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s meteoric rise is all the more remarkable because he campaigned on a shoestring budget, relying largely on social media, while his rivals enjoyed generous public funding and coveted slots on television and radio, which are awarded based on party size.Weeks before the first round of voting, Mr. Bolsonaro was stabbed at a rally and was forced to campaign from his bed. Wall-to-wall coverage of the attack, though, kept him in the headlines and seemed to have increased his appeal.Mr. Bolsonaro also benefited from last-minute endorsements from evangelicals and the powerful agribusiness industry.Mr. Haddad\u2019s campaign, which began only a month before the first round of voting, faced its own challenges. He was chosen to replace Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva on the ballot after the former president, who is serving a prison term on corruption and money-laundering charges, was barred from running as the Workers\u2019 Party candidate.Mr. da Silva had been leading in the polls until the courts ruled in August that he was ineligible to run.Despite the campaign slogan \u201cHaddad Is Lula,\u201d the less charismatic Mr. Haddad has failed to fully win over the former president\u2019s base. He also faced the wrath of voters who blamed the Workers\u2019 Party not only for the corruption scandal but also for a crippling recession that began on the watch of Mr. da Silva\u2019s successor, former President Dilma Rousseff.Soaring crime, a struggling economy and corruption have dominated the debate.Although Mr. Bolsonaro could not point to any major accomplishments during his seven terms as a lawmaker, he highlighted his clean record. He cultivated an image as a crude but honest candidate and vowed to reject traditional horse-trading.Brazilians\u2019 disgust with politics as usual became apparent in the first round of voting, when conservatives allied with Mr. Bolsonaro won a surprising number of congressional seats \u2014 52 up from eight \u2014 making his Social Liberal Party the second-largest in the lower house.While Mr. Haddad tried to distance himself from Mr. da Silva after the first round of voting \u2014 removing the former president\u2019s image from campaign ads and swapping the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s traditional red for the blue, green and yellow of the Brazilian flag \u2014 he dodged questions about the party\u2019s responsibility for the corruption scandal.Those positions are popular among many Brazilians because of the epidemic of violence plaguing much of the country, where a record 62,517 people were killed last year.Opponents of Mr. Bolsonaro have drawn attention to his long history of racist, homophobic and misogynistic remarks. The attorney general earlier this year charged him with inciting hatred against minorities, citing a speech during which Mr. Bolsonaro described visiting a traditional community of black Brazilians, whom he called fat and so lazy that they were \u201cnot even capable of procreating.\u201dMany of Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s supporters regard his controversial positions and remarks \u2014 he has called women ignorant, told a female lawmaker she was too ugly to rape and questioned why women should earn the same salary as men \u2014 as straight talk from a decisive and authentic politician.On the economy, Mr. Haddad appealed to poor voters with promises to extend social spending and \u201cmake Brazil happy again.\u201d But Mr. Bolsonaro has sought to win over the middle and upper classes, as well as the markets, by choosing Paulo Guedes, a pro-business, University of Chicago-trained investor to be his future finance minister.A victory by Mr. Bolsonaro could signal the crumbling of much of the political establishment, which has been dominated by the Workers\u2019 Party since 2002.\u201cThose red good-for-nothings will be banished from the homeland,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be a cleanup the likes of which has never been seen in Brazilian history.\u201dSome Brazilians have been concerned that Mr. Haddad\u2019s election could undermine the Car Wash investigation and lead to Mr. da Silva\u2019s release from jail. That gave them a reason to back Mr. Bolsonaro.Perhaps the biggest challenge facing the next president is the economy. Brazil is struggling to emerge from its worst recession on record, which left nearly 13 million people unemployed.Mr. Bolsonaro has promised to champion the agribusiness sector, which seeks to open up more forests to produce beef and soybeans. He has threatened to weaken or eliminate the Environment Ministry and withdraw funding from agencies that punish illegal loggers and miners.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "With $500 Million, New Jersey Wants to Invest in Your Start-Up", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAs part of his plan to reshape the economy of New Jersey, Gov. Philip D. Murphy wants the state to play the role of venture capitalist to lure start-up companies to the state. When he campaigned for governor, Philip D. Murphy leaned on a recurring quip in his stump speech: \u201cNew Jersey was Silicon Valley before there even was a Silicon Valley.\u201d He was conjuring the New Jersey of a decade ago, when the state was a leader in new and thriving companies in industries like biotech. Now, as he seeks to reshape the state\u2019s economy, Mr. Murphy wants New Jersey to utilize one of the most quintessential, lucrative and risky practices of Silicon Valley: venture capitalism. As part of an economic plan the governor announced on Monday, Mr. Murphy proposed to establish a fund that would allow the state to partner with private venture capitalists to invest in start-up companies that agree to set up shop in New Jersey. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a very sort of blunt-instrument, one-size-fits-all, big-company-focused tax incentive program that was our whole strategy,\u201d Mr. Murphy said in an interview. \u201cAnd almost nothing toward the start-up community.\u201dThe proposal is both unusual and routine: States often try to incentivize new companies to lay down roots, often with mixed results. But directly investing in start-ups carries additional risks. The companies could fail, and New Jersey would lose much-needed tax revenue. The private firms also could choose not to share their most lucrative opportunities with the state. \u201cThis is going to have to be very transparent process,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. Venture capital is among the riskiest of asset classes, and directly involving state funds could lead to losses. But Mr. Murphy said the current tax incentive plan was not working. The governor\u2019s model predicts that the tax credits will sell for roughly 90 cents on the dollar, giving some of New Jersey\u2019s major companies a tax break. That auction money \u2014 which the authority estimates will be about $250 million \u2014 would fund the program. This, of course, means the state would be diverting tax revenue into the new fund. Through a dollar-for-dollar match from private-industry partners, the state hopes to build a fund of $500 million. This type of fund is more useful to entrepreneurs than traditional tax breaks, Mr. Murphy said.\u201cTax incentives for start-ups is a non sequitur because they don\u2019t have any profits,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. \u201cSo there\u2019s nothing to tax.\u201dThe E.D.A. is under Mr. Murphy\u2019s control, enabling him to create the New Jersey Innovation Evergreen Fund without the approval of another branch of government.But auctioning tax credits would require legislative approval. Mr. Murphy said on Friday that he had \u201calready begun those conversations.\u201d Stephen M. Sweeney, the Senate president, did not return requests for comment. The two men have had a checkered legislative record since Mr. Murphy became governor in January. Working together, they passed some progressive bills on issues like voting rights, immigration and the environment, but they disagreed bitterly over the so-called millionaire\u2019s tax, leading to a fight that nearly shut down the government. Still, Mr. Murphy said he is \u201cpretty optimistic, actually\u201d that he will have the needed legislative support. No. New Jersey is looking to partner with the firms. The state does not want to be solely responsible for vetting pitches and business plans. Instead, it would partner with a venture capital firm once that firm had decided to invest. If, for example, an entrepreneur is seeking $20 million to launch a product and finds a venture capital firm willing to invest, the firm can then request that the state split the cost. The goal, according to the governor\u2019s office, is to minimize the private company\u2019s risk while offering an incentive to provide funding to start-ups in New Jersey.Mr. Murphy said he has not spoken to any venture capital firms yet. Chris Sugden, a managing partner at Edison Partners, a New Jersey-based venture capital firm, said he liked the idea. But, he added, the wheels of government and the speed of venture capital do not always move in sync. \u201cThis market moves fast,\u201d Mr. Sugden said. \u201cThe best deals \u2014 you\u2019ve got to be able to move fast. And that\u2019s how I\u2019ve shared it. I understand the desire to make sure the money is invested in New Jersey, but you also don\u2019t want guys in my business to be missing deals.\u201dAny company receiving investments from New Jersey will need to be based in the state. \u201cThat\u2019s the only \u2018must\u2019 with this plan,\u201d Mr. Murphy said. But restrictions in the venture capital world can be problematic, said Ian Hathaway, the research director at the Center for American Entrepreneurship, which studies start-ups. \u201cYou start getting into problems when you put restrictions on it, because if I\u2019m a top-tier investor, why do I even want to deal with that?\u201d he said. Mr. Hathaway said government programs designed to spur start-up growth need to \u201cget their house in order first.\u201d That, he said, ranges from \u201cmaking sure you have favorable capital gains tax policies\u201d to more indirect issues.\u201cLike what is the quality of life in New Jersey for well-educated professionals who have the option to live somewhere else?\u201d Mr. Hathaway said.\u201cThere\u2019s a difference between making it easier for companies that are already in the state to raise venture capital,\u201d Mr. Hathaway said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite another to say: Will people pick up and move to New Jersey because there\u2019s more capital available?\u201d Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Trump, Populists and the Rise of Right-Wing Globalization ", "Date": "2018-10-22", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe president and the far right want to keep the free movement of goods and money, but not of people. Mr. Slobodian is the author of \u201cGlobalists: The End of Empire and the Birth of Neoliberalism.\u201dFor those of us who came of age in the 1990s, there was an eerie sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Then, too, there were protests against global institutions insulated from democratic decision-making. In the most iconic confrontation, my college classmates helped scupper the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle in 1999.The movement called for \u201calter-globalization\u201d \u2014 a different kind of globalization more attentive to labor and minority rights, the environment and economic equality. Two decades later, traces of that movement are hard to find. But something surprising has happened in the meantime. A new version of alter-globalization has won \u2014 from the right.We often hear that world politics is divided between open versus closed societies, between globalists and nationalists. But these analyses obscure the real challenge to the status quo.President Trump and the far right preach not the end of globalization, but their own strain of it, not its abandonment but an alternative form. They want robust trade and financial flows, but they draw a hard line against certain kinds of migration. The story is not one of open versus closed, but of the right cherry-picking aspects of globalization while rejecting others. Goods and money will remain free, but people won\u2019t.The pattern of right-wing alter-globalization is repeated in Germany and Austria, where the Alternative for Germany and the Austrian Freedom Party have recently recorded electoral wins. Neither party proposes national self-sufficiency or economic withdrawal. In their programs, the rejection of economic globalization is highly selective. The European Union is condemned, but the language demanding increased trade and competitiveness is entirely mainstream. The Alternative for Germany takes fiscal conservatism to an absurd degree with criminal charges demanded for policymakers who overspend. Both parties call for no inheritance tax and burdensome regulations, even as they make new promises for social spending.Like Hong Kong and Singapore, these zones would not be isolated but hyper-connected, nodes for the flow of finance and trade ruled not by democracy (which would cease to exist) but market power with disputes settled through private arbitration. No human rights would exist beyond the private rights codified in contract and policed through private security forces. As Mr. Hoppe argues, the alt-right and identitarian vision of \u201ca place for every race\u201d need not conflict with a global division of labor. None of this need disrupt commercial exchange and the international division of labor. As Mr. Hoppe wrote, \u201cnot even the most exclusive form of segregationism has anything to do with a rejection of free trade.\u201d The maxim would be: separate but global.The varieties of right-wing alter-globalization differ significantly in degrees of horror. What they share is a rejection not of the \u201cpostwar international order\u201d \u2014 as many pundits fruitlessly argue \u2014 but of the order of the 1990s. In the cross hairs are the products of that decade, above all, the crown jewels of neoliberal globalism: the W.T.O., the European Union and Nafta (which was recently renegotiated and renamed).The right\u2019s alter-globalizers unite in a condemnation of the structures of multilateral governance that emerged from that decade along with their implication that democracy and capitalism were twins joined at the reported \u201cend of history.\u201dInstead, in a forthright embrace of inegalitarianism, they question the ability of every country and every population to practice democratic capitalism and, in many cases, propose a departure from status quo democratic capitalism themselves. The idea that openness is under attack is too vague. The formula of right-wing alter-globalization is: yes to free finance and free trade. No to free migration, democracy, multilateralism and human equality.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "What\u2019s Wrong With Germany\u2019s Social Democrats?", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe party should be embracing the challenge of economic inequality. Instead, it\u2019s shrinking away.Mr. Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.HAMBURG, Germany \u2014 What does it take to make a major political party so frustrated with itself that it prefers therapy over governing? The German Social Democrats are mired in a sort of depression. Call it power-phobia. The party governs the country as the junior partner with the center-right Christian Democrats, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2014 yet many members fear that carrying on in this coalition might destroy them.The party seems to be in free fall. In recent elections in the state of Bavaria, the Social Democrats, known by their German acronym SPD, scored their worst result ever, sliding from 20.6 to 9.7 percent. There is another election due in the state of Hessen this Sunday, where polls point to a similar result.Part of the party\u2019s problem is that Ms. Merkel\u2019s conservatives have co-opted many of the center-left\u2019s ideas, from the introduction of the minimum wage to the establishment of same-sex marriage, and in doing so both embraced and suffocated the Social Democrats.But there\u2019s another, self-inflicted reason for the malaise of the SPD. In the past two decades the Social Democrats have shifted to the right economically, but (perhaps as a compensation) to the left culturally. This may be fine for the country\u2019s urban upper classes, but it leaves most German voters confused about the party\u2019s appeal.At the same time, the SPD has ignored an issue that a center-left party, born of the labor movement, should be eager to embrace. Germany, the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy and Europe\u2019s richest country, is a prosperous place \u2014 but one rived by inequality and social injustice.You have to look twice at traditional data to see the scale of the problem. Unemployment has halved in the past 20 years, from around 11 percent to around 5 percent; private wealth has nearly doubled, to 11.7 trillion euros today. Wages have risen, too. Meanwhile, the richest 10 percent of the households in Germany possess nearly 60 percent of the entire net household wealth, according to a study by the trade union-linked Hans B\u00f6ckler foundation, well over the average for developed countries. This is Ms. Merkel\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel. Why has SPD not attacked it?The answers is that, in order to do so, the Social Democrats would have to confront themselves with their very own shortcomings, with failures that touch the heart of their leftist self-image. Over the last two decades, largely under the auspices of the Social Democrats \u2014 either as the governing party, or as the junior party with control over domestic ministries \u2014 state-financed poverty has been replaced by privately-financed poverty.The maximum rate kicks in comparatively early, with an annual income of around 55,000 euros. But how fair is it, from a leftist point of view, that the same tax rate applies to someone earning 200,000 euros? Nor did the SPD seem to mind that the chief executive of Deutsche Post earns 239 times the salary of his average employee.Then came the refugee crisis, which hit at a time when the belief in solidarity among Germans themselves had reached a low. All of a sudden, it seemed, the Social Democrats rediscovered their empathy for the underprivileged \u2014 as long as they had come from abroad. The party showed a striking lack of interest, at least rhetorically, on the social costs imposed by the arrival of over a million refugees.Yet the SPD\u2019s moral outrage did little to answer a complex question that confronts the entire continent: How do you distribute scant resources fairly in a framework that transgresses national boundaries?To organize globalization in a fairer way, into one a system at least resembles the balances of the old nation state, is both a demanding and a highly demanded task for Social Democracy today. It is something that the center left should be ready to tackle. Instead, the Social Democrats turning inward, unable to answer the country\u2019s most pressing questions at a time when Germany needs them.Jochen Bittner is a political editor for the weekly newspaper Die Zeit and a contributing opinion writer.Advertisement"}

Engel, of \u201cImpeachment: An American History.\u201d COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa \u2014 President Trump was energized. Fresh from the fight to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, he was firing up thousands of supporters at a rally by complaining about how Democrats had treated his nominee and how they may yet try to remove Justice Kavanaugh from the bench.\u201cBesides that,\u201d Mr. Trump then added slyly, \u201cI have to go first, right?\u201d The crowd laughed. Perhaps only in the Trump era would the prospect of being impeached become a punch line for the president of the United States. But after almost two years of living under the cloud of a possible impeachment, it may soon cease to be a laughing matter. While Democrats are largely ducking the topic on the campaign trail, few in Washington doubt that impeachment will be on the table if they win the House on Nov. 6.If that happens, anyone who thought the battle over Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation was ugly and divisive should buckle up, because history suggests it would provide only a small taste of what lies ahead. The impeachment drives against Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton tore at the nation\u2019s fabric, but an effort to remove Mr. Trump could lead to an even more incendiary conflict, thanks to the advent of social media and Mr. Trump\u2019s brand of blowtorch politics.Impeachment, by its nature, represents the ultimate test of American democracy, a titanic clash between two branches of government over whether the nation\u2019s leader has done such damage to the integrity of the Republic that the will of the people as expressed in our complicated election system should be overturned. It is, in effect, a moment of reckoning, as the framers intended it to be, a judgment on the standards of society as they shift through time.Rather than being apprehensive about the threat, Mr. Trump, who loves a good brawl, seems almost eager for Democrats to bring it on. He has begun making his case in recent months without waiting for the election. In August, he warned that if he is impeached, \u201cthe market would crash\u201d and \u201ceverybody would be very poor.\u201d In September, he told supporters it would be their fault if he is impeached because it would mean \u201cyou didn\u2019t go out to vote.\u201dAnd in Iowa, he laid out what would undoubtedly be his public argument. \u201cYou get impeached for having created the greatest economy in the history of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best job numbers in the history of our country, just about, right? The greatest trade deals, which we\u2019ve just finished, in the history of our country.\u201dPutting aside the hyperbole about the economy and jobs numbers, which are both strong but hardly the best ever, Mr. Trump has a certain advantage going into any impeachment fight. The history of presidential impeachments shows that they are started by the opposition party but are never successful unless the president\u2019s party buys into the effort.In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, a Democratic House might impeach him, but even if Democrats take the Senate, they would still be far from the two-thirds necessary for conviction, meaning that 15 or more Republicans would have to go along. Such a scenario seems unlikely unless the special counsel, Robert Mueller, produces a report with such damning information that it transforms the current political dynamics.But once again, the country would be confronted with the question of what the framers meant by \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors.\u201dNixon\u2019s case was a more clear-cut abuse of power and obstruction of justice: the Watergate burglary to spy on his political opposition and the resulting cover-up, including the payment of hush money and, finally, a transcript of the \u201csmoking gun\u201d tape of him trying to order the C.I.A. to block the F.B.I. investigation. The House Judiciary Committee voted to impeach, and Nixon resigned rather than continue to fight after fellow Republicans abandoned him.Bill Clinton\u2019s case fell somewhere in the murky middle. Charged with perjury and obstruction of justice for trying to impede a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones and by hiding his affair with a former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky, Mr. Clinton was impeached on a nearly party-line vote in the House and acquitted in the Senate. Defenders were left to argue that yes, he may have violated the law, but it was not such a profound violation to merit removal.But it is hard to imagine Democrats not going there if they take the House, given the enormous pressure from their liberal base to at least open an impeachment inquiry. Three-quarters of Democrats told pollsters that they want Mr. Trump impeached. Tom Steyer, the liberal billionaire who has been financing television ads advocating impeachment, announced this past week that he has collected six million signatures on a petition.Peter Baker is an author, with Jon Meacham, Timothy Naftali and Jeffrey A.

{"Headline": "Hurricane Michael Victims\u2019 Biggest Fear: \u2018People Are Going to Start Forgetting\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-21", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMARIANNA, Fla. \u2014 After two weeks of working grueling hours on hurricane response and sleeping fitfully under a tatty Auburn University fleece in his office, Rodney E. Andreasen, the emergency management director for Jackson County, Fla., decided on Friday that it was time to nudge his neighbors back to normalcy.He started by scaling back on round-the-clock staffing. Then he turned to the county\u2019s eight multiagency \u201cpoints of distribution\u201d \u2014 known as PODs \u2014 which have been handing out free drinking water, ice, canned goods, hot meals, diapers, garbage bags, and the most coveted item of all, toilet paper.Seven of the sites would have to be shut down within the next few days, he told unhappy local officials, with only the handout point in Cottondale, west of town, to stay in operation.\u201cYes, yes, yes, we are consolidating the PODs \u2014 and yes, yes, yes, people are getting upset,\u201d Mr. Andreasen, 59, said in his office, surrounded by boots, guns and clothes he rescued after Hurricane Michael\u2019s winds destroyed his own house out in the countryside. \u201cBut we are doing it.\u201d\u201cThe grocery stores are starting to come on line, and we want to start pumping money back into the economy,\u201d said Mr. Andreasen, who worries a green fidget spinner to work off excess energy. \u201cIf people are getting food for free, they aren\u2019t going to the stores, so the stores can\u2019t pay people, and so on and so on \u2014 the ripple effect. So I get to be the bad guy. I\u2019ve got to make that call.\u201dBut many in Jackson County are simply not ready for the hurricane relief to end. There is a feeling, fair or not, that officials \u2014 even the well-liked Mr. Andreasen \u2014 are moving too fast, chasing the image of normalcy before a real recovery has taken root. That feeling of being hurried, and eventually left behind \u2014 the normalizing of a catastrophe \u2014 is a growing worry for people who are caught between a short-attention-span country that has seen one disaster after another and the long-term effort it takes to rebuild battered lives.Marianna, a Florida Panhandle town with a population of about 10,000, was hit almost as hard by Hurricane Michael as Panama City was, 60 miles to the southwest near the coast. Downtown Marianna still looks like London after the Blitz. Heaps of shattered brick storefronts spill into the streets, and numb residents pick through the ruin of what once were flourishing neighborhoods.About 600 structures in the county are so severely damaged that they cannot currently be occupied, officials said, and more than 400 of those are likely to be bulldozed, because of wind, tree and water damage.Almost 82,000 homes and businesses in Florida were still without electricity on Sunday, the authorities said, and in Jackson County, which includes Marianna, some 75 percent of customers still did not have electric service \u2014 with rumors of a rainy week ahead.Power is not expected to be fully restored in the Marianna area for 10 or 11 more days, emergency management officials said; that is around when schools in the county are scheduled to reopen. \u201cThey are basically rebuilding the whole grid from scratch,\u201d said Christopher J. Eliadis, an emergency management coordinator from nearby Walton County.President Trump landed, toured, commiserated and left Florida a week ago. The national media has largely moved on. Now the PODs are closing down, and that is troubling news for some residents, who see the stations, with their contingent of National Guard troops, as signs that they are not being forgotten.\u201cPeople are under the misconception that the minute power goes back on, everything returns to normal,\u201d said Alicia L. Corder, town clerk of Greenwood, who was overseeing operation of a POD there on Saturday.In Greenwood, a crossroads town of 700 people just north of Marianna, Guard troops and volunteers were handing out supplies \u2014 bags of ice, adult diapers and tarps were in high demand \u2014 to people in a line of cars outside the small town hall on Saturday afternoon. Even though the number of people pulling in for help had fallen to about 100 on Saturday from about 400 on Friday, local officials were alarmed to learn of plans to shut the center down.\u201cWe have a lot of elderly people here, and people who don\u2019t have a lot of money, and this is their lifeline,\u201d Ms. Corder said. \u201cThe thing that makes this storm different is that it isn\u2019t just about power. So many houses were destroyed. You can\u2019t get back online when you don\u2019t have a building to live in, or a building for your business. We need at least another week before we can close down.\u201dMorgan Bush, 24, said she was still struggling to feed her five children, even though her house, in a rural area just south of town, was only lightly damaged. On Saturday, she pulled up to an impromptu aid station set up by three friends from the Tampa area who had driven north with supplies culled from their cupboards and local churches.\u201cWe really need help \u2014 not having power for this long makes it really hard,\u201d Ms. Bush said, as she loaded provisions from the small stock of cans and toilet paper arrayed on a tarp in front of a wrecked downtown hardware store.\u201cWe came here because we know people are going to start forgetting,\u201d said one of the volunteers, Norma Ward, 49, a home health care provider from Plant City. She said she chose to go to Marianna in part because she believed Panama City was getting most of the attention at the expense of other areas.\u201cYou can only see so many pictures on TV of broken homes and trees,\u201d she said. \u201cThen you start thinking, \u2018O.K., everything\u2019s all good again.\u2019\u201dAt the moment, there is no shortage of relief in Jackson County. The work of restoring the power goes on around the clock, with more than 1,000 utility workers on the job. Faith groups like the Convoy of Hope, the humanitarian arm of the Assemblies of God Church, and the Southern Baptist Convention say they have no intention of scaling back their efforts until the need abates.Aid had been slow to reach some rural parts of the county, but by the weekend, most residents with storm damage had heard from Federal Emergency Management Agency officials about repairs and temporary housing. Still, many people displaced by the storm struggled to find help as they dealt with spotty cellphone service and the shock of a life-changing eventJoseph R. Hill, his wife and three young children have been living out of his silver SUV for the past week. After racing north to avoid the worst of the storm\u2019s winds, he returned last week to find that the spacious three-bedroom house he bought 14 months ago had been heavily damaged, and flooded with rainwater.He registered on the FEMA app, and an inspector came out to Marianna on Friday. But on Saturday Mr. Hill was still unsure of the status of his application for temporary housing, and had sent the rest of his family to live with a relative in Port Charlotte.\u201cI just sense there\u2019s a lack of care,\u201d said Mr. Hill, an unemployed former corrections officer. Two friends were helping make repairs to the peeled-back roof of his house as new rain began to fall.There are signs that the region is slowly recovering. Power has returned to downtown Marianna, allowing a few stores to reopen, including the gas station and the Winn-Dixie supermarket. \u201cIt does a lot of good for people to look out and see the glow of those lights at night,\u201d said Louis Roberts III, the county sheriff.On Saturday, Governor Rick Scott toured one of the PODs at a church in Marianna, and repeated his pledge to provide local leaders with anything they needed. He said he was pleased with the relief effort overall, but he lamented that the loss of communications during the height of the storm hampered initial recovery work.\u201cWe have been through bad storms \u2014 Hermione, Matthew, Irma and now Mike \u2014 and the difference with this one is that we lost landlines, we lost internet, we lost mobile,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cWe were out of touch with places, and that has never happened before. We have to do a better job pre-positioning assets.\u201dThe recovery is also progressing at a crawl in the hardest-hit places nearer the coast. In Bay County, which includes Panama City and Mexico Beach, vehicle traffic regularly comes to a standstill, utility trucks block roads, and spray-painted pieces of plywood stand in for missing street signs.But the crowds have dwindled somewhat at places in the county offering free food and water, and lines for gasoline are easing every day. Cellular phone service \u2014 still at just 66 percent of normal on Sunday \u2014 has been improving. A high school football game was played on Saturday, and public schools were expected to reopen no later than the week of Nov. 12.On Friday night in Panama City Beach, a band played at a cafe known as Dat Cajun Place while servers brought out heaping platters of shrimp Creole and bread pudding.There were a few reminders, though, that life had not fully returned to normal: Utility workers filled a few tables, bottled water was served because of contamination fears, and last call was at 8:30 p.m. on account of the local curfew.Mr. Andreasen thinks he can relax Jackson County\u2019s 7:30 p.m. curfew next week. But even as he tries to kick-start normalcy in the county, he is beginning to grapple with the years of recovery that loom ahead, and the toll it has taken on his own family, which has relocated over the state line to Enterprise, Ala.\u201cI was talking to this girl the other day who told me how she had lost everything,\u201d he said \u2014 his voice suddenly choking with emotion.\u201cThen I realized I\u2019d lost everything, too.\u201dGlenn Thrush reported from Marianna, Fla., and Alan Blinder from Panama City Beach, Fla.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Even the Seemingly Disappointing Job Creation Numbers Are Actually Pretty Great", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byEmployers added only 134,000 jobs last month, but that doesn\u2019t reflect the robustness of the economy. But even apart from the usual warnings about statistical error and randomness (the true rate of job creation could turn out to be either much higher or much lower), the numbers are a good bit better than that single data point suggests.There\u2019s reason to think that Hurricane Florence temporarily depressed the numbers by taking many hourly workers off the payrolls in the Carolinas. The number of leisure and hospitality jobs fell by 17,000, and retail jobs by 20,000 \u2014 both sectors prone to be affected.And revisions to previous months\u2019 numbers were positive, so there was more momentum heading into September than it had seemed. August was already reported to be strong, but now looks to have been a blockbuster month for job creation \u2014 the previously reported 201,000 jobs added has been revised up to 270,000.In other words, if you simply took those 69,000 extra jobs created in August and credit them to September, suddenly you would have two months of very steady job creation at a high rate.And that\u2019s not even mentioning the drop in the unemployment rate to 3.7 percent, from 3.9 percent. That\u2019s the lowest level during the current economic expansion. And lower than in the 1990s boom.To find the last time the jobless rate was lower, you have to go back to when Richard Nixon was in the White House, when men had only recently walked on the moon, and when the Beatles were still together.The even better news is that the last time the jobless rate was this low, at the end of 1969, it was already fueling high inflation. Consumer prices rose 5.9 percent that year. Currently, that measure is 2.7 percent.The new leadership of the Federal Reserve has played down the value of relying on some estimate of the \u201cnatural rate\u201d of unemployment below which inflation is inevitable, and the data this year seems to affirm the caution.Put simply, we don\u2019t know how low joblessness can go, and how long it can stay there, without resulting in something bad (overheating) as opposed to something good: more people working and earning higher incomes.As recently as a couple of years ago, not too many people would have predicted a 3.7 percent unemployment rate, let alone a 3.7 percent unemployment rate in an environment of benign inflation and only modest wage growth.In September 2016, for example, the median forecast of Federal Reserve officials was that the unemployment rate would be 4.5 percent at the end of 2018; it now looks likely to be substantially lower.It\u2019s the latest piece of evidence that 2018 is set to be the best year for the United States economy in quite a long time. But it\u2019s also evidence of just how much we don\u2019t know about even the not-too-distant economic future.An earlier version of this article misstated the rate of the rise in private sector hourly wages over the last year. It has been 2.8 percent, not 3.8 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After Lots of Bluster, Trump Has a Week to Brag About", "Date": "2018-10-05", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 He promised so much success that everyone would be tired of all the winning. But after 20 months that proved more arduous than President Trump once imagined, this may be the best week of his presidency so far.None of this necessarily changes the fundamentals of an often-chaotic presidency that has defied norms and struggled with scandal, but it gives Mr. Trump a fresh narrative to take on the campaign trail just a month before critical midterm elections that will determine control of Congress. With the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, turning quiet during campaign season, Mr. Trump has an opportunity to redirect the conversation onto more favorable territory.\u201cFrom his standpoint, it\u2019s been a good week after many bad ones,\u201d said David Axelrod, who was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama. \u201cFor a self-proclaimed perpetual \u2018winner,\u2019 he will have had some big wins to tout. The jobs figure, other than wages, and the after-Nafta agreement are positive.\u201dStill, in Mr. Trump\u2019s scorched-earth presidency, even victories come at a cost. The relationship with Canada was deeply scarred by his brutal negotiating tactics, while America has been ripped apart by the battle over Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination, fraught as it was with gender politics that Mr. Trump seemed eager to encourage and anger on the left and the right.\u201cThe impact of Kavanaugh is more of a mixed bag, further inflaming both sides, which could help him retain or even expand his Senate margin but further imperil the House,\u201d Mr. Axelrod said.Mr. Trump is the first president in American history never to have held public office or served in the military, and his inexperience has shown at times. Unfamiliar with the workings of government, legislation or diplomacy, he has often been stymied in his efforts to achieve goals like repealing Mr. Obama\u2019s health care law, toughening immigration regulations, building a wall along the Mexican border or bringing peace to the Middle East.Until recent days, he proved more effective at blowing up agreements than reaching new ones. He pulled out of an Asian-Pacific trade pact, a global accord on climate change and a nuclear deal with Iran, but has made no progress in negotiating replacements, as he suggested he would. His most significant legislative achievement was last year\u2019s tax-cutting package, which was forged in large part by Republican congressional leaders who had their own reasons for pushing it through.\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful week. We\u2019re thrilled,\u201d Kellyanne Conway, his counselor, said in an interview. \u201cIt shows that his perseverance and his tenacity and his adherence to campaign promises and principles are paying dividends.\u201dSome Republican activists said Mr. Trump had shown that defying conventional wisdom could work.The cause for celebration in the White House, of course, was cause for mourning among his opponents. In the view of his critics, he will be putting a man credibly accused of sexual assault on the nation\u2019s highest court, he blew up friendships with America\u2019s neighbors for a new trade deal whose actual impact has been exaggerated, and he has appropriated credit for the economy from Mr. Obama while ballooning the deficit in a way that conservatives have until now always condemned.James J. Blanchard, an ambassador to Canada under President Bill Clinton, attended the groundbreaking of a new bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, on Friday and said that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada \u201cwas upbeat\u201d following the new trade deal. Mr. Trump was right to update the trade agreement, he said, although \u201cit probably could have been done six months ago without the cheap theatrics,\u201d and now \u201ceveryone knows we need to repair relations, but no one expects Mr. Trump to do that.\u201dWhether the string of success for Mr. Trump will translate into support on the campaign trail could be the defining test of the next few weeks. Mr. Trump\u2019s own approval ratings remain mired at just over 40 percent in most polls, a historically low level for a president that usually signals losses for his party this close to an election.\u201cIndependents especially are tired of the chaos and the uncertainty,\u201d said Patti Solis Doyle, who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign manager in 2008. \u201cYes, the economy is good; yes, Trump got two conservative judges on the court; and, yes, he is doing what he promised on the campaign trail\u201d in terms of trade, tax cuts and tougher immigration enforcement. \u201cBut at what cost?\u201d she asked. \u201cTariff wars, separating children from their mothers, huge deficit. I can go on and on.\u201dMr. Trump plans to take his case on the road with a frenetic burst of campaigning in the weeks to come. He heads to Kansas on Saturday and will be on the road six of the next eight days, mainly for boisterous arena rallies where he rouses his conservative base with red-meat speeches.Midterm elections are about turnout, and Democrats have been more energized for months, intent on stripping Mr. Trump of his party\u2019s control of the House and possibly the Senate. While conservatives had grown more animated over the battle for Judge Kavanaugh, once he is confirmed, Democrats may be more motivated to vote out of anger at the outcome, especially women who are upset that allegations of sexual assault were disregarded.And it is not at all clear that when it comes to promoting his strongest political points, Mr. Trump can stay on message. Even this week, as he highlighted the new trade agreement, which he is calling the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or U.S.M.C.A., he drifted off to other subjects, as he is wont to do.One truism of the Trump presidency has been how quickly the story line changes from week to week, or day to day. New tales of palace intrigue or flare-ups of international tension or revelations stemming from various investigations could easily swamp a message of progress by the Nov. 6 election.As Mr. Axelrod said, it is not clear \u201chow any of this will factor in a month from now, which is an eternity in the Age of Trump.\u201dFollow Peter Baker on Twitter: @peterbakernyt.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "After Nobel in Economics, William Nordhaus Talks About Who\u2019s Getting His Pollution-Tax Ideas Right", "Date": "2018-10-13", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA few governments \u2014 notably, parts of Canada and South Korea \u2014 have adapted his ideas in ways that frame them as a financial windfall for taxpayers. NEW HAVEN, Conn. \u2014 William D. Nordhaus, the Yale economist who shared the Nobel in economic science this week, has pointed words for some of the experiments so far with his theories on taxing polluters to fight climate change.\u201cIt was a catastrophic failure in the European Union,\u201d he said just days after not only being awarded the Nobel, but also seeing his life\u2019s work embraced in a landmark United Nations assessment of the global threat of climate change. That document, approved by more than 180 nations, described Professor Nordhaus\u2019s ideas as essential for slowing the carbon dioxide emissions that are rapidly warming the atmosphere.But in other places around the world \u2014 notably, parts of Canada and South Korea \u2014 politicians have adapted the idea in ways that not only show signs of working, but that also reframe it not as a tax, but as a financial windfall for taxpayers. Other governments, including China and some individual states in the United States, are also testing different ways to force companies to pay to pollute. In short, the world is becoming a laboratory for theories that Professor Nordhaus developed decades ago, when global warming was an abstract future threat. By contrast, this week\u2019s United Nations report amounts to a stark warning of immediate risk. The Nobel, which Professor Nordhaus shared with the New York University economist Paul M. Romer, was widely perceived as a rebuke to President Trump, who has called climate change a hoax and sought to roll back the United States\u2019 existing climate change policies. It is also seen as a broader challenge to powerful Republican political voices in the United States, among them the libertarian billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch and the anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, who have attacked lawmakers who support a carbon tax, making it among the most volatile ideas in American politics.On Wednesday, Professor Nordhaus discussed his carbon pricing theories and the political landscape. The exchanges have been edited and trimmed.It\u2019s been caught up in the politics, and it just happens that this particular policy is one that has faced the wrath of a whole group of thinkers. Grover Norquist, energy companies, it\u2019s the Koch brothers and their foundations, it\u2019s people using fair tactics and foul tactics \u2014 it\u2019s been caught up as one of the issues in the Great Divide. This anti-tax movement has been so powerful and so harmful in the United States. There have been a large number of conservative economists in the United States who have endorsed the idea of a carbon tax.Where has carbon pricing been successful? Where has it failed?With the E.U., their projected carbon emissions were high, but the actual carbon emissions were low, and the carbon price fell drastically, from $30 to $40 per ton down to single digits. So the price was so low it did not have an effect in lowering emissions. It was flawed design. If the models had predicted too few emissions, and the price had gone to $1,000 per ton. we would have had a different problem.When I talk to people about how to design a carbon price, I think the model is British Columbia. You raise electricity prices by $100 a year, but then the government gives back a dividend that lowers internet prices by $100 year. In real terms, you\u2019re raising the price of carbon goods but lowering the prices of non-carbon-intensive goods.That\u2019s the model of how something like this might work. It would have the right economic effects but politically not be so toxic. The one in British Columbia is not only well designed but has been politically successful. What went wrong when President Obama tried to implement a carbon price in 2009?I did not talk to Obama about this directly, but I spoke with many of his advisers over the years.One of my very, very few disappointments in Obama when he was president is that he did not come out in favor of carbon tax. I\u2019m sure he did the political calculus on this. He should have come out and talked not just about climate change and its dangers but how to use a carbon tax to fix it. He was a great speaker a great educator but this is one where he let us down, I think.How do you think a carbon tax could get bipartisan support?Things change over the long run. What is toxic or opposed in one generation gradually becomes accepted in the next. Social security took a long time. It was opposed for many, many decades but since Reagan is has been widely accepted.On carbon taxes, people\u2019s views have changed from being very hostile, to conservative economists embracing this, to the I.P.C.C. saying, this is the approach.I have to be hopeful that, if we continue to work on this, the public will get there on the science, and make an exception to the toxicity of taxes. It will help if it\u2019s tied to something popular \u2014 if, as a result of the revenue from a carbon tax, you get a check in the mail, or it funds health care.In terms of implementation, it\u2019s not much more difficult to implement than a gasoline tax. Gasoline taxes are very easy to implement.But gasoline taxes are also politically toxic.Only in this country! In other countries, people are grown-up, and they can live with taxes. The problem is political, rather than one of economics or feasibility. It\u2019s because it\u2019s used as a weapon. At some point, I\u2019m hopeful that grown-ups will take over and we will do what is necessary. I hope so. If we don\u2019t, then things will just get worse and worse.Do we have enough time to avoid the warming that will bring severe and damaging effects of climate change?It\u2019s not going to happen in time for 1.5 degrees. It\u2019s very unlikely to happen for 2 degrees. We\u2019d have to be very pessimistic about the economy or optimistic about technology for 2 degrees. If we start moving very swiftly in the next 20 years, we might able to avoid 2 degrees, but if we don\u2019t do that, we\u2019re in for to changes in the Earth\u2019s system that we can\u2019t begin to understand in depth. Warming of 4, 5, 6 degrees will bring changes we don\u2019t understand because it\u2019s outside the range of human experience in the last 100,000 to 200,000 years.We\u2019ve been going backward for the last two years. Maybe we can stop going backward and start going forward.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Duterte\u2019s Luster Dulls as Rice Prices Soar in Philippines", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMANILA \u2014 Through controversy after controversy, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines has always been able to count on his appeal among the nation\u2019s poor. But soaring prices for staples like rice are starting to alienate that vital base of support.But he now faces deepening discontent in an area that particularly affects the urban poor: the price of food.The country\u2019s inflation rate has hit a nine-year record \u2014 6.7 percent \u2014 after climbing for nine consecutive months, the Philippine Statistics Authority said last week. That situation is bad enough that on Tuesday Mr. Duterte ordered restrictions dropped on the importing of rice, ending a decades-old protectionist policy administered by the country\u2019s National Food Authority.Over the past year, vegetable prices have gone up nearly 20 percent, fish prices 12 percent and meat prices 7 percent. And while global rice prices have been stable, prices in the Philippines have been as high as double the import price.\u201cFive hundred pesos feels like one peso now,\u201d said Lilian Gomez, 52, for whom it doesn\u2019t take long these days to hit her budget limit at the Agora market in Manila. \u201cAll the prices have gone up since Duterte became president.\u201dShe said she had not bought fresh meat or fish in two months, and she reminisced about cooking dishes whose ingredients she could no longer afford: banana blossoms stewed in coconut milk, eggplant with shrimp paste, spicy taro leaves.To stretch the rice she buys for her family of three, she plumps it into porridge.Characteristically, Mr. Duterte responded to the higher prices first with threats.Publicly, he began suggesting that there was a conspiracy among rice dealers. He labeled them as cartels, hoarders and smugglers, telling them to \u201cstop messing with the people.\u201d\u201cConsider yourselves warned,\u201d he said, \u201cor the full power of the state will be upon you.\u201dEmmanuel Pinol, the agriculture secretary, backed up Mr. Duterte\u2019s threats with high-profile raids of rice warehouses, and announced a bounty of 250,000 pesos, or about $4,600, for information leading to the arrest of rice hoarders.The blame began widening, with Mr. Duterte suggesting that President Trump\u2019s trade war with China was part of the problem \u2014 as were drug addicts, who he joked had replaced their meth habits by eating huge quantities of rice, driving up prices.The National Food Authority initiated several emergency imports of rice, each time assuring the public that the intervention would drop prices, but it proved too small and too late.Experts say the country\u2019s food agency has become paralyzed by infighting among Duterte appointees. And his administration is being widely accused of mismanagement that has steadily worsened inflation and threatened to slow the economic growth that Mr. Duterte has prioritized.Ramon Clarete, a professor of economics at the University of the Philippines Diliman in Quezon City who specializes in agriculture and food policy, said the problem with rice, in particular, was a crisis of the government\u2019s own creation.\u201cIt was the incompetent mistake of the N.F.A. not stocking itself adequately that gave fuel to inflation,\u201d Mr. Clarete said of the National Food Authority, which is responsible for maintaining rice stocks and influencing prices within the Philippines\u2019 protectionist import regime. \u201cIt could be they are not appreciative enough of how the market works. Or cruel.\u201dOther factors are adding to Mr. Duterte\u2019s problems. Global oil prices are rising, making fuel more expensive. The value of the country\u2019s currency, the peso, has weakened because of broader investor concerns about global growth, driving up the price of imports.But driven to keep the country\u2019s growth revved up for years, leaders in the Philippines have contributed as well. In addition to tightly controlling rice supplies, the country has long kept interest rates low. Mr. Duterte has slashed taxes and increased infrastructure spending. All that adds to economic growth but tends to drive prices up, too.This has created immediate frustrations among the poor and the middle-class Filipinos whom Mr. Duterte has heavily courted during his time in office.The administration has lowered import taxes, and pledged to increase supplies of affordable fish and fuel \u2014 moves that the political analyst Richard Heydarian described \u201cas a reflection of a sense of desperation on the part of the government.\u201dWith Tuesday\u2019s move to drop restrictions on rice imports, Mr. Duterte has taken the biggest step yet, most likely in recognition that his political base is wavering.The urban poor are the largest voting bloc in the Philippines, and Mr. Duterte courted their votes with promises to transform their lives and bring in a wave of infrastructure improvements that would modernize the country.A new tax law that was passed to help pay for Mr. Duterte\u2019s infrastructure plan lowered income taxes for the middle and upper classes. But it increased excise and value-added taxes, pushing prices up across the board. Even as infrastructure projects stalled, continued investment in them contributed to increasing inflation, along with rising global prices for oil and a weakening currency.While Mr. Duterte\u2019s popularity has begun to drop among the poor and the middle class, according to recent polls, it has certainly not disappeared, with satisfaction ratings still topping 60 percent for his administration.But pollsters who monitor issues of national concern say economic worries now dominate lists of national concerns, with inflation at the top, followed by stagnant wages and the need for job creation.The Philippines has long been among the fastest-growing economies in Southeast Asia, and that has continued. But the rising prices have begun to have an effect. The World Bank downgraded Philippine growth prospects from 6.7 to 6.5 percent, as did Moody\u2019s, citing the negative effect of inflation.Maria Fe Villamejor-Mendoza, a professor of public policy at the University of the Philippines Diliman, said discontent could manifest in the midterm elections next May, with fewer of Mr. Duterte\u2019s allies winning seats.But in the short term, she said, \u201cthe administration is panicking and imagining scenarios to divert the attention of the people away from inflation,\u201d citing allegations of a plot by university students, public statements about Mr. Duterte\u2019s health and the resignation of a controversial government official after a series of scandals.\u201cThey underestimated the effect of inflation,\u201d Ms. Villamejor-Mendoza said, and the administration was doing \u201cdamage control, in order that people will not remember the hardship of the value of the Philippine peso.\u201dMr. Heydarian said that events like the spike in prices eroded Mr. Duterte\u2019s popularity and over time could diminish his power. As Mr. Duterte\u2019s historically high approval ratings fall to more normal levels, he may be forced to provide concessions to the old elite and other centers of power, and the opposition will be more emboldened to criticize him.\u201cThat kind of Duterte is increasingly becoming a reality,\u201d Mr. Heydarian said. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge climb down from the kind of aura that he projected in his first year of office.\u201dMr. Heydarian said that while Mr. Duterte effectively distinguished himself from the political elite establishment with his vulgar and defiant style, economically he was more \u201cconventional, rather than pro-poor and progressive.\u201dThe idea resonates among people eager to see action from Mr. Duterte.Angelito Batac, a 53-year-old carpenter in Navotas, in northern Manila, said: \u201cThis started when Duterte became president. We can\u2019t breathe. He\u2019s not doing anything but curse.\u201dMr. Batac\u2019s wife, Evangeline, agreed. \u201cHe said all the poor will no longer be poor,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we\u2019re even poorer.\u201dBirgit Hansl, lead economist in the Philippines for the World Bank, said some of Mr. Duterte\u2019s policies could still bear fruit. A measure adding two years to mandatory education will better prepare future generations for the work force, she said. And even some of Mr. Duterte\u2019s infrastructure projects coming to fruition would be of wide benefit, she added. However, it would still take years for the effects of those reforms to be felt.Ms. Villamejor-Mendoza, the public policy professor, said that while there may be disappointment in Mr. Duterte\u2019s unfulfilled promises, it is not turning into rage as much as disillusionment. \u201cIt\u2019s a learned hopelessness,\u201d she said.Uvigilda Condez, 47, who lives in Navotas, said she had high hopes for Mr. Duterte when he was elected. She believed him when he said he would fight for Filipinos.\u201cIt could have been great,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe we have some hope that life will become easier, but nothing has happened yet. Life seems to have gotten harder.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to be able to change,\u201d she added. \u201cHe\u2019s just like everyone else.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Where Trolls Reigned Free: A New History of Reddit", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.Even then, at a moment of techno-optimism we are unlikely to see again in our lifetimes, Reddit was a toxic swamp. It was the place you went, shrouded in anonymity, for pornography, hard-core racism, revenge porn, Nazi cheerleading, Jew-baiting, creepshots, fat-shaming, mindless anarchy and pictures of dead kids or of women who had been beaten. If anyone bothered to look, Reddit was proof that on the internet, the trolls were in charge.Founded in 2005, soon after Facebook, Reddit has always been something of an anomaly among companies whose content was generated by users. Its founders, barely out of their teens, had no real vision. It wasn\u2019t even their idea. They cashed out as soon as they could. The buyer was Cond\u00e9 Nast, home of America\u2019s toniest magazines, but executives there had no vision either. Reddit was created by millions of Americans with a taste for darkness. You can\u2019t blame this one on Vladimir Putin.In the beginning, Reddit users simply shared links about interesting things they read. Then comments were added. The job of moderating was assigned to anonymous volunteers, who created and shaped \u201csubreddits\u201d to their own passions. This was a genius move: It allowed Reddit not only to keep its staff lean, but to distance the company from the sleazier content.Christine Lagorio-Chafkin, a writer for Inc. magazine, tells the Reddit story in \u201cWe Are the Nerds.\u201d The two co-founders, Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian, cooperated extensively. I admire them for doing so because despite Lagorio-Chafkin\u2019s best efforts \u2014 Ohanian is called \u201ccharismatic\u201d or celebrated for his \u201ccharisma\u201d on Pages 47, 158, 214, 223 and 330 \u2014 they come off as whiny and callow schemers, and not the sharpest of sticks. On the very first page, the two University of Virginia seniors cannot figure out what a \u201ckiosk\u201d is.The title \u201cWe Are the Nerds\u201d doesn\u2019t really fit the tale. \u201cWe Are the Trolls\u201d would have made much more sense. \u201cI was always kind of an [expletive],\u201d Huffman explains early on. Lagorio-Chafkin bluntly calls him \u201ca total troll.\u201d He was also a genius programmer. The great achievement of the social internet was to unleash jerkdom for many while monetizing it for a few.The Reddit tale is an indictment of Silicon Valley, something Lagorio-Chafkin seems to sense but never confronts head-on, perhaps because she is so grateful for access to Huffman and Ohanian. \u201cTwo nice guys who made it, by crafting something incredible and yet ridiculously unwieldy, with no lack of turbulence along the way,\u201d Lagorio-Chafkin writes in an author\u2019s note. A more accurate summation might be: \u201cTwo inexperienced young guys created something they didn\u2019t understand and couldn\u2019t control.\u201dIt\u2019s all here anyway: the lack of adult oversight; the suck-up press; the growth-at-any-cost mentality; the loyal employees, by turns abused and abusive (memo from management: \u201cYou do realize you were talking about penises for 90 minutes, right?\u201d); the defense of horrendous behavior as \u201cfree speech\u201d; the jettisoning of \u201cfree speech\u201d when it served corporate purposes; the way no one seeks permission but all expect forgiveness.\u201cWe Are the Nerds\u201d is most compelling when it tells the story of a third young man who played a founding role at Reddit. Aaron Swartz was brilliant, troubled and impossible, but he saw the tech economy more clearly than well-medicated people. \u201cIn the old days the new money was made through theft and abuse of office,\u201d he wrote. \u201cNow any random computer programmer \u2014 or even the people who hung around them \u2014 could find themselves saddled with a pile of cash.\u201d In early 2013, hounded by the government over a stupid stunt involving the downloading of academic journals, Swartz committed suicide.Reddit became so offensive it was difficult to work there. A community manager who had a brief tenure in 2015 told Lagorio-Chafkin some of the reasons: \u201cChild molesters, child porn, vicious stalking, rape threats, serious harassment, people taking the harassment offline and people filing police reports on each other.\u201d One chief executive, stressed beyond endurance, simply stopped showing up for work. His replacement, Ellen Pao, tried to impose order in the office and on the site. The backlash led to her abrupt departure. Huffman returned and purged most of the staff.The charismatic Ohanian came back as well, trying a few Reddit spinoffs that fizzled. He is best known now for being Mr. Serena Williams. I wondered if any of his new relatives ever asked him about the popular subreddit called CoonTown \u2014 you can guess the contents \u2014 but \u201cWe Are the Nerds\u201d is silent on this. CoonTown was finally banned by Reddit in 2015.I also saw a lot of ads. Reddit is worth about $2 billion, which means Advance Publications, the parent of Cond\u00e9 Nast and now Reddit\u2019s biggest investor, made good money. In Silicon Valley, that\u2019s still pretty much all that matters.David Streitfeld covers Silicon Valley for The Times.

(The plan is said to be a backup, in case a meeting next month between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China doesn\u2019t yield results.) The tariffs could cover about $257 billion worth of goods \u2014 including popular items like iPhones and Nike sneakers.The decision, which came after the American chip maker Micron accused Jinhua of intellectual property theft, could be a crippling blow to the Chinese company. (And it drew comparisons to the Trump administration\u2019s harsh actions against ZTE earlier this year.) The penalties will delay China\u2019s effort to establish a homegrown chip industry that doesn\u2019t rely on American parts.Behind that volatility were continuing investor concerns that tech stocks are overvalued. Amazon, for instance, fell 6.3 percent yesterday, while Netflix dropped 5 percent, and shares in both are down over 20 percent this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.6 percent on Monday, and is off 13 percent from its August high.Trade fears also weighed on stocks, after a report that President Trump may impose tariffs on all remaining imports from China, raising fears about increasing costs for American businesses and consumers.U.S. markets are looking stronger this morning, however, with futures for major indexes up.In the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, social media is coming under close scrutiny.

The government will ask for 2 percent of revenue the companies generate in Britain. Mr. Hammond said the plan could eventually raise as much as \u00a3400 million annually.But the tech industry is unimpressed.

{"Headline": "How Much Power Do \u2018Millennials\u2019 Actually Have?", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFirst WordsWhatever future civilization picks over the ruins of our own will find a curious ritual preserved in the archaeological record of the late 2010s \u2014 an outlet, they may suspect, for the anxieties of a society in free-fall. First comes a report revealing that young people have abandoned and destroyed yet another cornerstone of postwar American life, like country clubs or breakfast cereal or mayonnaise. Then young people read the report, for all the same reasons you pick at a scab, and completely lose their minds.This future archaeologist might note how apt it was that these young people were given such a portentous, end-of-days name: millennials. At this point, \u201cmillennials\u201d stand accused of \u201ckilling\u201d so many industries that there is a whole meta-genre of articles mocking the clich\u00e9: Mashable\u2019s \u201cR.I.P.: Here Are 70 Things Millennials Have Killed,\u201d BuzzFeed\u2019s \u201cHere Are 28 Things Millennials Are Accused of Killing in Cold Blood,\u201d Broadly\u2019s \u201cI Did All the Things Millennials Are Accused of Killing.\u201d Business Insider keeps something like an authoritative list of the body count, which includes casual-dining chains, golf, \u201cbreastaurants\u201d like Hooters, diamonds, starter homes, homeownership in general, designer handbags and banks.Millennials, clearly, are not living the lives of easy abundance bestowed on generations past \u2014 no fighting over the check at Outback Steakhouse, no need (or budget) for a station wagon. What young people seem to find galling is the implication that they\u2019ve had any choice in this. Structural shifts in the economy \u2014 stagnant wages, the skyrocketing cost of housing, colossal student debt \u2014 have put millennials on the path to a lower quality of life than their parents. So when some Australian guy claims that the reason they can\u2019t buy homes is that they spend too much on avocado toast, as the millionaire developer Tim Gurner did last year, it\u2019s easy to see why young people would explode.They laid this theory out in a 2000 book called \u201cMillennials Rising,\u201d painting a rosy portrait of my generation that now seems equal parts laughable and prophetic. We were optimistic and collaborative, lovers of authority and institutions and rules \u2014 not sullen and caustic, like the neglected, latchkey Gen Xers. (The echo baby boom of the 1980s led to a resurgence of interest in parenting, making us \u201cthe most watched-over generation in memory.\u201d) With our focus on \u201cachievement, modesty and good conduct,\u201d they predicted, millennials would soon \u201centirely recast the image of youth from downbeat and alienated to upbeat and engaged.\u201dThat last bullet point, the conservative streak, is perhaps the most at odds with contemporary stereotypes. But they may not have been totally wrong; it\u2019s possible that those impulses were simply redirected by the winds of history. Strauss and Howe saw a cohort whose moralism would result in younger marriages and courtship based in \u201cdeference to parents\u201d; they didn\u2019t expect that it might attach to pop culture instead. (Though they did accurately predict that millennials\u2019 sitcoms would become \u201cmore melodramatic and wholesome,\u201d their rap music \u201ctamed and domesticated.\u201d) Similarly, it is true that millennials believe in institutions to the same degree that Gen Xers sneered at them, but Strauss and Howe could not see how this faith would combine with a sheltered, idealistic upbringing: Instead of creating new institutions, millennials seem interested in forcing the old ones to live up to their high-minded rhetoric. The book dedicates a whole chapter to \u201czero tolerance\u201d regimes in school, but can\u2019t imagine the ways young people would internalize this logic and direct it at the failures of the world around them.This is why \u201cmillennial,\u201d in the mouth of an older person, often sounds pejorative: To them, we are an ocean of people demanding treatment no one before them ever received, and drastically reshaping everything in our path, from college campuses to the mattress industry.Nevertheless, I have devised a crude system of my own to resolve the impossible tensions the word contains. In this system, all births from 1982 through 1989 are \u201cgood millennials,\u201d representing the half of the generation genuinely hoodwinked by the collapse of the old economic order. (Obviously, this group includes me.) All births 1990 and beyond \u2014 those who have few predigital memories beyond \u201cBarney\u201d episodes and had better luck skirting the recession, but seem intent on being defined by an all-consuming ennui \u2014 are, unfortunately, \u201cbad millennials.\u201dThis distinction might be glib, cruel and imprecise \u2014 maybe even inaccurate to the point of uselessness \u2014 but such is the solemn enterprise of naming generations. I recommend you come up with a system of your own.Advertisement"}

I know about what so many of us men think about women \u2014 the language we use, the sense of power that we garner through our sexual exploits, our catcalling and threatening, our sexually objectifying gazes, our dehumanizing and despicable sexual gestures and our pornographic imaginations. This is not simply locker room banter but a public display of unchecked bravado for which we often feel no shame.We have heard many accounts from women of what it is like to live under the yoke of our self-serving construction of a violent, pathetic and problematic masculinity. It is time that we stop gaslighting their reality.By now, many of you are probably saying, this doesn\u2019t apply to me \u2014 I\u2019m innocent.It\u2019s true that many of us, including me, have not committed vile acts of rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse the likes of which Harvey Weinstein has been accused of. We have not, like Charlie Rose, been accused of sexual harassment by dozens of women who worked for us; and we are not, like Bill Cosby, being sent to prison for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman, in this case, Andrea Constand. Yet I argue that we are collectively complicit with a sexist mind-set and a poisonous masculinity rooted in the same toxic male culture from which these men emerged.I\u2019m issuing a clarion call against our claims of sexist \u201cinnocence.\u201d I\u2019m calling our \u201cinnocence\u201d what it is \u2014 bullshit. As bell hooks writes in \u201cThe Will to Change: Men, Masculinity and Love,\u201d men unconsciously \u201cengage in patriarchal thinking, which condones rape even though they may never enact it. This is a patriarchal truism that most people in our society want to deny.\u201d When women speak out about male violence, hooks writes, \u201cfolks are eager to stand up and make the point that most men are not violent. They refuse to acknowledge that masses of boys and men have been programmed from birth on to believe that at some point they must be violent, whether psychologically or physically, to prove that they are men.\u201d We have learned it. In the language of Simone de Beauvoir, \u201cOne is not born, but rather becomes\u201d masculine.We mask that vulnerability. I find hooks\u2019s description powerful and true to my own experience as a boy: \u201cLearning to wear a mask (that word already embedded in the term \u2018masculinity\u2019),\u201d as hooks writes, \u201cis the first lesson in patriarchal masculinity that a boy learns. He learns that his core feelings cannot be expressed if they do not conform to the acceptable behaviors sexism defines as male. Asked to give up the true self in order to realize the patriarchal ideal, boys learn self-betrayal early and are rewarded for these acts of soul murder.\u201dWhat does hooks mean by \u201csoul murder\u201d?When I was about 15 years old, I said to a friend of mine, \u201cWhy must you always look at a girl\u2019s butt?\u201d He promptly responded: \u201cAre you gay or something? What else should I look at, a guy\u2019s butt?\u201d He was already wearing the mask. He had already learned the lessons of patriarchal masculinity. I was in an unfortunate bind. Either I should without question objectify girls\u2019 behinds or I was gay. There was no wiggle room for me to be both antisexist and antimisogynistic and yet a heterosexual young boy. You see, other males had rewarded his gaze by joining in the objectifying practice: \u201cLook at that butt!\u201d It was a collective act of devaluation. The acts of soul murder had already begun.Yet I, too, participated in acts of soul murder. As early as elementary school, the young boys would play this \u201cgame\u201d of pushing one another into girls. The idea was to get your friend to push you into a girl that you found attractive in order to grind up against her. I was guilty: \u201cHurry up! Push me into her.\u201d He pushed, and the physical grind was obvious. She would turn around, disgusted, and yell, \u201cStop!\u201d Youthful? Yes. Was it sexist and wrong? Yes. This was our youthful collective education; this is what it meant for us to gain \u201cmasculine credibility\u201d at the expense of girls.Later, I was also made to believe that girls were \u201ctargets,\u201d objects to be chased down and owned. That is the contradiction. For example, at about 16, we used to play a game called \u201cCatch a girl, get a girl.\u201d There was no equivalent called \u201cCatch a boy, get a boy.\u201d After all, as boys, we named the game. We would count to give the girls a head start. We would then run after them. If you caught a girl, you could steal a kiss. Some of the boys attempted to grope the girls.The logic governing the game, unseen by both the boys and the girls, was predicated upon sexist assumptions that relegated the girls to positions of prey. This is what American male culture taught us early on: Women were like \u201cmeat\u201d and we must always nurture a voracious appetite. This fact alone should challenge how we construe \u201cmutual consent.\u201d The game was orchestrated around what the philosopher Luce Irigaray would call a \u201cdominant phallic economy.\u201d We chased; they ran. We were the pursuers; they were the pursued. Our objective was to \u201cget them.\u201d We gazed upon the prey and then we would strike. Though the girls played, they were not to blame. We were the \u201cwinners,\u201d possessors of conquered territory. That is part of the early training that I received when it came to my toxic masculinity.Looking back, I wish that I could speak face to face to that younger self and undo the soul murder. Yet, I am not beyond redemption. That young boy is still learning from the older me. I have tremendous love to give him, a demanding love that he learn to undo the toxicity of male masculinity.This is why Donald Trump Jr. got it all wrong when he was asked which of his children he is most concerned for and he answered, \u201cRight now, I\u2019d say my sons.\u201d This is pure obfuscation, a substitution of fictions for facts, and a form of dangerous denial regarding the reality that his daughters may one day face. With that statement, he lied to his daughters.Trump Jr. should get his priorities straight. In a male-dominated and sexist toxic world, a world where his own father grabs women\u2019s genitalia and kisses them without their permission, it is our daughters who should concern us as targets of sexual violence. Trump Jr. should be concerned about raising his sons not in the image of his own father but in the image of those of us men who are prepared to recognize our soul murder, our toxic masculinity, and to do something about it.What are we afraid of?We all recently lived through the public spectacle of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. What is at stake transcends but also includes Christine Blasey Ford\u2019s allegations that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school during the 1980s. The history of toxic and violent masculinity should have been enough for us to give full weight to the reasonableness and believability of Ford\u2019s testimony. But we did not.Donald Trump\u2019s cruel public mocking of Ford in Southaven, Miss., days after her testimony was despicable and must be seen as another violation of Ford\u2019s character. And as the crowd laughed and applauded, including women present, Ford\u2019s words, her emotional testimony, were denounced as the ramblings of someone without any claim on the veracity of her experiences. To add insult to injury, Sarah Huckabee Sanders\u2019s defense that Trump was just \u201cstating the facts\u201d is both a blatant lie and a further act of cruelty, a denial of Ford\u2019s pain and denial of the collective suffering of women more generally from acts of sexual violence.I can imagine being passionate about defending myself if put in Kavanaugh\u2019s position. Kavanaugh, however, unabashedly reinforced white male machismo and aggressiveness such that even if one thinks that he is innocent of what Ford accused him of, he put on full display the performance of a cantankerous white male who is recklessly determined to seek revenge against those he claimed were out to get him.The history of male violence against women speaks to Ford\u2019s pain and suffering. The statistics regarding sexual assault are telling: One in five women are raped at some point in their lives; 90 percent of rape victims are female; in the United States one in three women experience some form of contact sexual violence in their lifetime; roughly half of female victims of rape reported being raped by an intimate partner and 40 percent by an acquaintance; in eight out of 10 cases of rape, the victim knew the perpetrator. We can no longer deny this reality. Since the world is watching, we, as men, need to join in the dialogue in ways that we have failed to in the past. We need to admit our roles in the larger problem of male violence against women. We need to tell the truth about ourselves.Advertisement"}

She looks around the lab with pride. \u201cThis room was basically a storage locker.\u201dBefore 2014, the Bristol school district fell on the less fortunate side of the \u201cdigital divide,\u201d a term reflecting the disparity between communities with and without adequate access to technology and the internet. As science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) resources became almost ubiquitous in other districts, FDR Middle School was left behind \u2014 like so many schools in low-income or rural neighborhoods around the country. \u201cOur students couldn\u2019t compete,\u201d Hannah-Barone says.When children don\u2019t have connected devices at home, it can create a \u201chomework gap,\u201d because they are at a disadvantage when it comes to researching topics they\u2019re studying. In the U.S. today, nearly half of adults with household incomes below $30,000 a year don\u2019t have broadband services or a traditional computer. And 24 percent of rural adults say access to high-speed internet is a major problem in their communities, a Pew Research Center survey conducted earlier this year found. This means many students nationwide are disconnected. \u201cIf young people don\u2019t get an equal chance to experience sophisticated technologies early on, it impacts not only their career success but also civic engagement,\u201d says Mark Warschauer, professor of education and informatics at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cAnd the consequences can ripple out to the entire country.\u201dThe digital divide can damage the economy. \u201cWith more than four million unfilled jobs in science and technology, this isn\u2019t merely a crisis of education, says Rose Stuckey Kirk, Verizon\u2019s chief corporate responsibility officer. \u201cIt\u2019s an economic crisis.\u201dVerizon, by using its technology and resources to help with this important societal issue, has committed more than $400 million toward bridging the digital divide. Since 2012, the Verizon Innovative Learning Initiative has partnered with 100 under-resourced middle schools around the nation, equipping every student and teacher with free technology and 24/7 internet access. It also provides schools with extensive teacher training, support and the opportunity to engage in a unique, immersive curriculum to leverage technology in their classrooms. \u201cVerizon Innovative Learning took the opportunity to intervene with some of the most under-resourced children in America\u2019s middle schools,\u201d Kirk says, \u201cin order to fundamentally change the way teachers teach and children learn.\u201dIn 2014, FDR Middle School became part of the Verizon Innovative Learning initiative, receiving devices and free internet access, training and hands-on education. Two years later, the school debuted the first-of-its-kind Verizon Innovation Learning lab, which today includes virtual and augmented reality systems, coding equipment, 3-D printers and a multimedia production room. \u201cWith access to this technology and training, we have transformed our approach to teaching,\u201d Hannah-Barone says. \u201cIt\u2019s changed everything for this school.\u201dNear the laser printer, Tiger Techs Dema Harmon and Makenzie Farmer, both 13, huddle around a monitor, discussing how best to program the laser cutter. Dema first got interested in the lab because of the multimedia production room. \"My friend and I made a rap,\" she says. \u201cI\u2019m a singer. I want to make songs and videos.\u201dMakenzie aspires to be a fashion designer. \u201cI designed a dress on my tablet,\u201d she says. \u201cWorking at this lab makes me think I could do something that combines engineering and fashion.\u201dZandra Kawan, 13, is an aspiring astronomer. \u201cThis technology is fun, and I can use it for my future,\u201d he says, after removing a headset. \u201cWhen I\u2019m outside at night, I look up and see planets, and then when I come in here, I can see them up close in virtual reality.\u201dIn the Verizon Innovative Learning program, the Tiger Techs also pick up valuable leadership and communication tactics, which can help boost their self-esteem. \u201cI learned that I have the skills for teaching,\u201d says Emily Voshchilo, 14. \u201cEven if I don't go further into technology, this program made me realize I have skills I can use.\u201dThe program also addresses the gender disparity in STEM fields. \u201cAt FDR, you have a tech squad that\u2019s composed of a lot of girls and a few boys,\u201d Kirk says. \u201cYou are seeing girls in leadership positions. They\u2019re confident, and they show others that they can master this technology.\u201dWhen it comes to operating new devices or apps, students aren\u2019t the only ones who need coaching. \u201cTeachers can be uncomfortable using technology because that\u2019s not how they learned to teach,\u201d says Hannah-Barone. Part of her job at FDR is to make the tech transition easier for instructors, giving them in-depth training on how to incorporate technology into their classrooms.\u201cIn order for our students to compete with artificial intelligence one day, they actually have to be able to think on their own, to find problems and solve them,\u201d Hannah-Barone says. \u201cThat requires the teachers to let go of the control.\u201dThe program at FDR is especially effective at reaching students who have trouble learning in more traditional classroom settings. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing advances with our special ed population,\u201d says Kevin Boles, the school\u2019s principal. \u201cWhen we put technology in front of these students who often work better hands-on, we\u2019re seeing noticeable improvements.\u201dAttendance rates at FDR have also increased. \u201cWhen you give the students a lot more freedom,\u201d Boles says, \u201cthey feel better about being here.\u201dIn fact, students are dropping by every chance they get. \u201cStudents show up during their lunch and break times. We can\u2019t keep them away,\u201d Hannah-Barone says with a broad smile. She motions to the kids all around the lab, thoroughly engrossed in their work. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing.\u201dVerizon Innovative Learning aims to triple the number of partner schools over the next few years and enable 5G, the next generation of cellular network data transmission, in 150 of them. 5G will provide faster speeds, reduced delays and increased system capacity, which for schools will translate into more-immersive virtual reality, greater bandwidth for big-data analysis and faster load times for apps or educational videos. 5G will also allow for connected, \u201calways on\u201d laptops, even outdoors or in other remote areas where internet access is typically spotty.

{"Headline": "Eurozone Growth Slips to Four-Year Low, Fueling Crisis Fears", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFRANKFURT \u2014 Economic growth in the eurozone has fallen to its slowest pace in more than four years, and Italy is not growing at all, according to figures released Tuesday. The snapshot is likely to sharpen political divisions in the European Union and make the region more vulnerable to the forces rattling financial markets.Both numbers were unexpectedly poor. Eurozone growth in the quarter was only half as fast as it had been in the previous three-month period, and the rate of growth has fallen each of the last three quarters.One of the European Commission\u2019s criticisms of the Italian budget is that it was based on overly optimistic estimates of future economic growth. Now those estimates look even less realistic.Investors registered their disappointment by bidding up the market interest rate on Italian government bonds on Tuesday. That will only amplify the country\u2019s problems.The rates on government bonds serve as benchmarks for the rates that Italians pay on business or consumer loans. Higher rates will squeeze spending and lead to yet slower growth.\u201cIt\u2019s a self-defeating cycle,\u201d said Lorenzo Codogno, chief economist at LC Macro Advisors in London. \u201cThe government is shooting itself in the foot.\u201dBut Mr. Codogno said he doubted that the populist parties governing Italy would retreat from their campaign promises, such as increases in pensions. To do so, he said, \u201cwould be political suicide.\u201dAnd Italy is not the only country in the eurozone facing political instability.The eurozone growth figure published Tuesday was a first estimate and contained no detail about what sectors led to the slowdown. Still, the causes are obvious enough.They include the prospect that Britain\u2019s separation from the European Union will be disruptive; a trade war with the United States that has interfered with trans-Atlantic commerce; and rising interest rates as central banks roll back the stimulus programs they used to combat the last financial crisis.Those risks are accumulating at the same time that financial markets are unusually nervous. Daily fluctuations in the prices of stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities like gold and copper are at their most extreme levels since 2008, when the last global financial crisis began, according to data compiled by analysts at the German bank Berenberg.The one somewhat bright spot in the numbers Tuesday was France, which registered growth of 0.4 percent from the previous quarter. But, coming after two weaker quarters, even that above-average result was not enough to achieve the 1.7 percent pace of expansion that economist say President Emmanuel Macron needs to validate his program of business-friendly reforms.The disappointing growth in the eurozone as a whole was partly caused by factors that aren\u2019t likely to repeat, leaving room for hope that growth will pick up toward the end of the year.For example, European car sales slumped 24 percent in September as auto manufacturers struggled to comply with new, stricter emissions standards. Cars were slow to reach dealers because of delays in getting regulators to certify vehicles for sale. Manufacturers such as BMW and Daimler have also been caught in the crossfire of President Trump\u2019s trade war with China.The slowdown in the car industry rippled through the eurozone and was probably most pronounced in Germany, the Continent\u2019s largest economy and motor of growth. Registrations of new Volkswagens slumped by nearly half in September, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The company at least temporarily lost its long-held status as the Continent\u2019s largest auto manufacturer to PSA of France, the maker of Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn cars.The brake on growth caused by the auto industry should dissipate soon, \u201cand the euro economy is likely to grow more strongly again,\u201d Christoph Weil, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients Tuesday.Bernd Meyer, chief strategist for wealth and asset management at Berenberg, pointed out that prices for tech stocks or real estate were not at the extreme levels that preceded past meltdowns.During a meeting with reporters Tuesday, Mr. Meyer argued that market pressure on Italy will eventually force the government to relent on its spending plans. But, he added, \u201cthey will only back down when they are staring into the abyss.\u201d\u201cRecent surveys,\u201d Mr. Nobile said in a note to clients, \u201care painting a rather bleak picture of eurozone growth.\u201dLiz Alderman contributed reporting from Paris.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "C.E.O.s May Avoid Riyadh Conference but Not Saudi Money", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPARIS \u2014 Saudi Arabia is pouring $20 billion into a new investment fund run by Wall Street\u2019s Blackstone Group. The French oil giant Total just inked a nine-billion-euro petrochemical deal with the kingdom. The British defense company BAE Systems is selling 48 Typhoon combat jets to Riyadh for an estimated five billion British pounds.Companies are still assessing the situation, which shifted rapidly as the kingdom announced on Friday that Mr. Khashoggi was dead and that it had arrested 18 Saudis in the case. But short of sanctions on Saudi Arabia, or a wholesale change in policy by the United States, Britain or other governments to curb political or commercial ties, big business won\u2019t readily quit its relations with Riyadh.\u201cSaudi Arabia still has enormous wealth and powerful cachet,\u201d said Bruce O. Riedel, a former C.I.A. analyst and an expert on Saudi Arabia at the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt will continue to be a crucial economic player, and it cannot be ignored. The question is whether business as usual will go on.\u201dCompanies don\u2019t always break out how much money they have reaped from Saudi connections. But a review of the kingdom\u2019s broad spending on its military, infrastructure, oil, chemicals, technology and even entertainment underscores how Riyadh is simply too big a customer to ignore.American start-ups have benefited from the largess, as Saudi Arabia became their biggest source of capital last year. Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund recently invested $1 billion in Lucid, a competitor to Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla car company, and $3.5 billion in Uber.Western banks have lined up for the chance to advise the Saudis. The kingdom has generated about $1.1 billion worth of fees for banks since 2010 in a variety of deals, including mergers and acquisitions and the arranging of loans and bonds, according to data from Dealogic.While Stephen A. Schwarzman, Blackstone\u2019s co-founder and chief executive, dropped out of the conference on Monday, the firm has no plans to sever ties with the kingdom.\u201cWe have relationships with them, their institutions, over decades,\u201d Jonathan D. Gray, Blackstone\u2019s president, told analysts on an earnings call on Thursday. \u201cWe think of ourselves as long-term, responsible stewards of capital.\u201dSome companies did not even try to distance themselves from the Saudis amid the Khashoggi furor. A spokeswoman for BAE said in a statement that it would send several senior executives to the Saudi conference.Separating itself from the Saudis would be difficult for a defense contractor like BAE, which has 6,000 employees in the kingdom. The company counts on Saudi Arabia for at least 15 percent of its revenue, from both the sale of equipment like the Typhoon and the contracts to service them.The situation is also critical for France, which has longstanding ties to Saudi Arabia and is the third-largest foreign investor after the United States and the United Arab Emirates. France sold \u20ac11 billion worth of arms to the kingdom in the last decade, and recently approved licenses for more sales potentially worth \u20ac14.7 billion. That doesn\u2019t count \u20ac4 billion in French exports to the kingdom last year, and oil and chemical deals worth over \u20ac20 billion signed in the last two years.Even as the conference has caused consternation, companies still appear to be laying the groundwork for deals.Though the chief executive of Thales, Patrice Caine, pulled out of the conference, the French company is sending a subordinate the Saudis would respect, and a spokesman, C\u00e9dric Leurquin, said Thales hadn\u2019t changed its position on investing in Saudi Arabia. Although Mr. Leurquin would not divulge sales figures for Saudi Arabia, Thales has 700 employees in the kingdom, which it supplies with military hardware, missiles, electronic warfare systems and even high-tech security surveillance systems for Mecca and other holy sites.A week after Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance made headlines, Total, one of the world\u2019s largest oil and chemical groups, announced a \u20ac9 billion joint venture with Saudi Aramco for a refining and petrochemical complex in Jubail. Total did not respond to requests for comment.\u201cThis is a very serious topic where you cannot win,\u201d Joe Kaeser, the chief executive of the German industrial giant Siemens, said this week as he tried to decide whether to attend the conference. The company received a blockbuster order last year for five gas turbines in Saudi Arabia, and has a gas turbine factory in its Eastern Province.\u201cIf we skip communicating with countries where people are missing, I can just stay home,\u201d Mr. Kaeser declared.An earlier version of this article misidentified the leader of the Saudi-French Business Council. He is Dr. Mohammed bin Laden; he is not the leader of the Saudi Binladen Group or the father of Osama bin Laden.Liz Alderman reported from Paris, and Michael J. de la Merced from London.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Divide and Rule", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe conversationPresident Trump is operating from an ancient political playbook. Ms. Collins and Mr. Stephens are opinion columnists. They converse every other week.The practical question is whether the report might lead to tax-evasion charges. There\u2019s a fine line between avoidance and evasion, and the dodges the Trump family used often seemed to push the envelope of legality even if they didn\u2019t quite push past it. Of course, the larger issue is a tax code that\u2019s filled with so many loopholes that it allows the ultrarich to game the system. How about lower rates for all and exemptions for none?All of which is to say that you\u2019re right. Democrats really do need to come up with a forward-looking agenda for 2020, because if all they have to talk about are the Trump family\u2019s tax dodges from 30 years ago, or if they try to relitigate the 2016 election, they will lose again.Or maybe it\u2019s the Republican Party? There\u2019s a lot of talk about divisions between left and center among the Democrats, but it doesn\u2019t compare to what\u2019s happened to the Republicans. It\u2019s really two parties, with the establishment so terrified of the Trump train, they\u2019re afraid to peep.But you\u2019re right. It does feel different this time. And I think the difference is that the fights aren\u2019t really about policy. They\u2019re about our personal experiences and deepest fears. Christine Blasey Ford was electrifying because so many women said: She\u2019s me; her suffering is so much like my own. And, at the same time, a lot of men fear that their careers could be upended by an allegation from long ago, unprovable but devastating. So we\u2019re not just arguing about the best course for the nation in the abstract. We\u2019re fighting for our own corner.Obviously, I\u2019d have voted no. By the end a vote for Kavanaugh was a vote for a guy who went out of his way to rally the troops by turning the nomination into a partisan us-against-the-Democrats battle. I realize the Democrats were not exactly working above the fray themselves. But the Supreme Court is about transcending partisanship. That\u2019s supposed to be the whole point. And if the justices don\u2019t always live up to that goal, that doesn\u2019t mean you pick a new guy who\u2019s given up the fight before he starts.But we can pursue this topic later, Bret. Right now I\u2019m going to finish recovering from the Kavanaugh crisis. I\u2019d say this calls for a lot of introspection and several glasses of wine.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "I Created \u2018The Bernank\u2019 on YouTube. And I Was Mostly Wrong.", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother ViewIn November 2010, as the Federal Reserve embarked on its second round of bond buying, Omid Malekan uploaded to YouTube a cartoon called \u201cQuantitative Easing Explained,\u201d which was critical of the central bank\u2019s response to the financial crisis. Within weeks, millions of people had viewed it. Here, nearly eight years later, he says that he got it largely wrong.It has been 10 years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers marked the unofficial start of the financial crisis. For those of us in finance who lived through that period, and the countless others affected by it, it remains hard to think of it as just a moment in history. A decade removed, the experience feels more like a mass injury that \u2014 grateful as we are to have survived \u2014 still lingers, and often manifests itself in the ongoing controversy over the government\u2019s response.I am a small part of that controversy, thanks to a YouTube cartoon I published in 2010 criticizing the Federal Reserve\u2019s bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing. The popularity of that cartoon surprised me. Like most things that go viral, it was more a testament to what was on people\u2019s minds than the quality of the work. Nevertheless, terms used in the cartoon like \u201cThe Bernank\u201d entered the economic zeitgeist, resonating with people who knew that they didn\u2019t like what was happening but lacked the technical vocabulary to express why.Most of the targets of my cartoon, including Ben Bernanke, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, have defended their actions and maintained that their work was effective in keeping the economic harm from worsening. I\u2019m inclined to agree. Quantitative easing worked, just not in the way it was intended. Before I explain why, I need to admit what I got wrong.Contrary to what one of my cartoon characters predicted, Q.E. didn\u2019t \u201cblow up the global economy.\u201d Instead, both economic growth and the financial markets have been remarkably steady. If anything, the expansion of central bank balance sheets has dampened volatility. It\u2019s still possible that the reversal of those policies will have a destabilizing effect, but even if that does happen \u2014 and I hope it doesn\u2019t \u2014 I was still way off the mark.The current economic expansion is one of the longest in history, and that too has surprised me. If you had asked me to predict the odds of another major recession eight years ago, not only would I have called it likely, I probably would have added that the very policies used to deal with the 2008 financial crisis would cause it. I was wrong about that, too.Ironically, those mechanics are something that Mr. Bernanke and I have always agreed on. He has often defended his actions by arguing that Q.E. is not the same as printing money because it only affects reserves in the banking system. Leaving aside the obvious overlap between the two concepts, I believe he\u2019s right. Q.E. was, first and foremost, a policy designed to enrich banks. In that sense, it worked remarkably, and tragically, well.Who does benefit? All the parties that have done disproportionately well in the past decade, like investment funds, large corporations and the wealthy. Debt levels have exploded among those groups, as have the valuations of the assets they tend to own: private companies, premium real estate and stocks. For this, I give Mr. Bernanke credit. History turned out almost as he predicted in his op-ed:\u201cLower corporate bond rates will encourage investment. And higher stock prices will boost consumer wealth and help increase confidence, which can also spur spending. Increased spending will lead to higher incomes and profits that, in a virtuous circle, will further support economic expansion.\u201dAccording to government data, almost a fifth of the United States population is either \u201cunderbanked\u201d or entirely disconnected from the financial system \u2014 a percentage that grew after the 2008 crisis. These are the people who have suffered the most in the past decade. Their existence outside the banking system almost guaranteed that they would not benefit from policies like lower interest rates.Quantitative easing worked, but not for those who needed it most.There was one other thing that I got wrong about the government\u2019s response to the financial crisis. I assumed that the effects, and side-effects, would be felt in the economic realm. But today, it\u2019s the political, social and even technological consequences that stand out.The growing wealth gap, which we now understand to be at least partially caused by such policies, has fueled many political and social movements. In this era of political polarization, the one belief that the far left and the far right increasingly share is that our economic system is somehow rigged. That perception has played a part in everything from the insurgent campaign of Bernie Sanders to Donald Trump\u2019s presidential victory.Most surprising of all, though, is that there is now a new kind of money \u2014 one borne out of the chaos of the financial crisis and the controversial policies enacted thereafter.Bitcoin and other digital currencies are the technological solution to a legacy monetary system that increasingly looks unfair. The decentralized nature and radical transparency of cryptocurrencies are a response to a banking system where institutions that were \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d have been enriched by Q.E. The code that underpins the Bitcoin blockchain is designed to treat the poorest citizen exactly the same way as the most powerful banker. After everything that\u2019s happened in the past decade, we can no longer say the same thing about the Fed.I disagree with some of my colleagues in the so-called cryptosphere on the potential for such coins to ever fully replace fiat money. But I am a proponent for many reasons, including the lifeboat they offer from poorly conceived economic policy. Despite the enduring controversy of the policies enacted in response to the financial crisis, their architects promise to repeat them in the future. But next time, those of us who are adversely impacted by such policies, or just morally opposed to them, won\u2019t have to stand idly by. Next time, we can take our money elsewhere.Omid Malekan is the author of \u201cThe Story of the Blockchain, a Beginner\u2019s Guide to the Technology Nobody Understands.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Sri Lanka\u2019s President Suspends Parliament, Escalating Political Crisis", "Date": "2018-10-27", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Sirisena suspended Parliament after ousting Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday, a move many lawmakers and government ministers denounced as unconstitutional. Mr. Sirisena swore in as prime minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, a popular former president who was accused of human rights abuses and corruption during a decade in power.Mr. Wickremesinghe struck a defiant tone, asserting that he was still prime minister. \u201cConvene Parliament, and I will prove it,\u201d he said.By Saturday afternoon, many lawmakers were vowing to stick by Mr. Wickremesinghe, demanding that a formal count be taken in Parliament to determine who held a majority in the house. That\u2019s when Mr. Sirisena announced that he was suspending Parliament. He also dismissed the leaders of several government institutions, replacing them with loyalists.As of 5 p.m. local time, Mr. Wickremesinghe remained in office at Temple Trees \u2014 the official state residence of the prime minister \u2014 where he briefed diplomats from the United States, Britain and elsewhere on the political developments.At a news conference earlier Saturday, he pledged to leave office if it was proved that he did not hold the majority in Parliament. The dispute could be resolved peacefully in the chamber without plunging the country into political crisis, Mr. Wickremesinghe said.But front-liners in Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s party have warned Mr. Wickremesinghe that they will give him only until Sunday morning to leave the official prime ministerial residence unless he wants the public to \u201cforce him out.\u201dTo clinch a majority in Parliament, Mr. Sirisena needs to secure just over half of its 225 seats to form a new government with Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s party. A tally on Saturday suggested they held only 98 seats.But Namal Rajapaksa, a lawmaker and the son of the former president, said by telephone that the numbers were in their favor.\u201cOf course we have more than 130 seats in Parliament, definitely,\u201d Namal Rajapaksa said. \u201cWe are already working on our policies to stabilize the economy and provide social stability.\u201dMr. Sirisena was a cabinet member in Mahinda Rajapaksa\u2019s government until he broke from the governing party to form a coalition with Mr. Wickremesinghe to contest the 2015 elections, which they won by a slim majority.In the run-up to elections, the coalition promised to investigate allegations of war crimes and corruption during the tenure of Mr. Rajapaksa, who simultaneously served as president and finance minister, among other cabinet positions, while his three brothers served as the defense secretary and ministers of economy and ports.But those investigations lagged under the unity government. The Rajapaksa family denies any wrongdoing, painting the allegations as lies perpetrated by their political opponents.Acrimonious divisions ultimately doomed the unity government, which was consumed by bitter infighting between Mr. Sirisena and Mr. Wickremesinghe. Sri Lankans have grown unhappy with economic stagnation and social unrest, including outbursts of sectarian violence.Whether Mr. Sirisena will face a backlash over his move remains to be seen. While Mahinda Rajapaksa is very popular, this is the first time since Sri Lanka earned independence from Britain that power has been handed over unconstitutionally, observers say.\u201cThe president has no authority to remove the prime minister,\u201d Jayadeva Uyangoda, a retired academic and political scientist, explained. \u201cThe removal of the prime minister is a function of Parliament, unless he resigns.\u201dNamal Rajapaksa, the former president\u2019s son, expressed confidence, saying the majority of Sri Lankans supported the new government because the previous cabinet had failed to govern effectively.\u201cIf you talk to people who voted for the unity government, they all agree that there is not unity in the unity government,\u201d he said. \u201cBut now you will have stability with the new government. People can oppose us, but at the end of the day, we will achieve a solution for the economic and social instability.\u201dMr. Sirisena\u2019s party may now join with Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s party, Namal Rajapaksa said, giving the family a good shot at reclaiming power in presidential elections next year.Indian and Chinese diplomats are watching the turmoil closely, having jostled over Sri Lanka in recent years as Beijing has tried to assert its influence in the region, New Delhi\u2019s traditional sphere of influence.China\u2019s ambassador to Colombo paid separate visits to Mr. Rajapaksa and Mr. Wickremesinghe on Saturday, posing for photos that each camp then disseminated to followers to project legitimacy.Under Mr. Rajapaksa, Sri Lanka\u2019s ties to India frayed while the country grew closer to China, which lent the government billions of dollars for questionable infrastructure projects.One of those, the Hambantota Seaport, became a symbol of China\u2019s dominance in Sri Lanka, with the Chinese company that built the harbor suspected of funneling money from the project to Mr. Rajapaksa. The harbor failed to attract business and was handed over last year to the state-owned China Harbor Group in a 99-year lease in exchange for debt relief.American officials worry China could eventually use the port \u2014 which sits at the crossroads of one of the world\u2019s busiest maritime routes \u2014 for military purposes, which officials in Beijing and Colombo have denied that will happen.It remains unclear whether Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s return to government would see Sri Lanka shift back to China\u2019s orbit. The former president flew to New Delhi in September and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India to smooth ties. Although China has the deep pockets India does not, many Sri Lankans consider India too geographically near to risk being on poor terms.But India\u2019s government has grown frustrated with Mr. Sirisena, accusing the president of delaying Indian infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka that were seen as diplomatic overtures. And although Indian diplomats recognize Mr. Rajapaksa\u2019s popularity in the country, they are still wary of him.Dharisha Bastians reported from Colombo, and Maria Abi-Habib from Lahore, Pakistan.Advertisement"}

Amid the turmoil, the government is trying to shore up support by giving cash back to the working class \u2014 with tax breaks next year worth 6 billion euros ($6.9 billion) for middle- and low-income earners \u2014 while reassuring investors that his designs for a \u201cnew French prosperity\u201d are on track.\u201cBut French people are skeptical,\u201d Mr. Le Maire told reporters last week. \u201cWe need to explain that this new model will be successful, and that it takes time before seeing the full benefits.\u201dIf convincing French voters is an uphill battle, it is especially challenging for Mr. Macron, who is viewed internationally as a dynamic European leader. His policies at home have yet to help most households.Mr. Macron promised voters that he could whittle unemployment to 7 percent by the next presidential election in 2022. To meet that target, the economy would have to grow by at least 1.7 percent in each of the next four years, which is by no means certain, according to the French Economic Observatory.The budget is aimed at \u201cmaking work pay\u201d by leaving more money in workers\u2019 pockets. But to keep the deficit in check, Mr. Macron is also trimming benefits for those not working, and cutting over 40,000 jobs in the public sector.Increases in pensions and family benefits would be capped at 0.3 percent a year, well below the 1.8 percent annual average inflation rate. Although 300,000 pensioners who make less than \u20ac1,200 a month will be exempted, many older voters are angry about those cuts and are taking to the streets in protest. There are 15 million pensioners in France, and three out of four voted for Mr. Macron in the second round of balloting.Yet even the business community has been grousing about Mr. Macron\u2019s changes. Some companies are upset about the government\u2019s plans to limit the use of short-term contracts, arguing that the policy ignores the needs of the modern workplace. Employers relied on short-term contracts during the financial crisis. The sort of innovative industry that France now seeks \u2014 whether digital or manufacturing-based \u2014 needs agile and fluid workers, business groups contend.Mr. Macron took pains on a tour of the French Antilles last weekend to appear more down to earth, glad-handing the public and standing in the rain for selfies with smiling crowds. \u201cI\u2019m not perfect. There are things that need to be corrected,\u201d he told the French newspaper Le Monde.He also remains adamant that his approach will benefit younger voters \u2014 including the 25-year-old gardener who couldn\u2019t find work. Mr. Macron listened to his complaint that horticulture jobs were hard to find and gave a rapid-fire response: Be flexible.\u201cIf you\u2019re willing and motivated, in hotels, cafes and restaurants, construction, there\u2019s not a single place I go where they don\u2019t say they\u2019re looking for people. Not one \u2014 it\u2019s true!\u201d Mr. Macron told the man.The French president is \u201ctaking a gamble,\u201d said \u00c9ric Heyer, the director of analysis and forecasting at the French Economic Observatory. \u201cBy easing taxes on the middle class, he\u2019s trying to get away from this image that he\u2019s \u2018president of the rich.\u2019\u201d\u201cThe measures will either deepen inequality or help growth,\u201d Mr. Heyer added. \u201cBut nothing is guaranteed to be a success, so it is unclear if he will win or lose the bet.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Can Poland\u2019s Faded Brutalist Architecture Be Redeemed?", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ArchitectureLong derided as relics of an oppressive regime, the country\u2019s Communist-era buildings are being given a second look, and a new life.Polish Brutalism was inextricably associated with Communist rule. Once, these buildings had promised a new future. Their modernity \u2014 their sheer scale \u2014 heralded all the potential of a rebuilding nation, and of a more just ideology that would provide an alternative to Western capitalism. By the 1990s, however, the sheen had vanished from the ideology and the buildings, too. Communism was a bad memory, and its architectural legacy inspired, at best, ambivalence. To this day, many Poles mutter about the poor quality and ungainliness of the buildings: gray, soulless reflections of an equally bleak era.Of course, architecture always bears the weight of history; our buildings are indelibly imprinted by the era in which they were conceived. But probably nowhere in Eastern Europe has witnessed more turmoil in the recent past than Poland, a country that has endured successive waves of invasion, genocide and occupation. And, as the rise of the country\u2019s right-wing government illustrates, the contestations of history are ongoing.All of this has imparted an especially complex (and convoluted) legacy to the country\u2019s Brutalist monuments. Those concrete and steel behemoths that mark the Polish landscape have long been reviled and rejected for their associations with Communism. Now, in a new post-Communist Poland, their fortunes may be changing: They have acquired a peculiar \u2014 if fraught \u2014 afterlife.Ironically, if these buildings began as a creative rebellion against Stalin\u2019s status quo, they would soon become closely linked \u2014 both temporally and ideologically \u2014 with the totalitarian rule and economic shortages of Communism. This connection emerged by association, almost by osmosis, as the spaces of communism came to define the experience of communism. Structures like Smolna 8, Piatek told me, may have begun their lives as hopeful symbols of openness and regeneration, but it wasn\u2019t long before they became seen as symbols of the Socialist state\u2019s failures.ALMOST 30 YEARS have passed since Communism came to an end in Eastern Europe \u2014 a sudden and dramatic collapse that, in fact, began in Poland, with the rise of the country\u2019s Solidarity labor movement. Poland has undergone a remarkable transformation in that time. The country that existed in the \u201990s \u2014 one of food shortages and widespread poverty \u2014 no longer exists. For several years now, Poland has had one of the fastest growing economies in Europe. Though the ghosts of the past still linger \u2014 the current government has (somewhat dubiously) cited the continuing influence of communism in its efforts to revamp the judiciary \u2014 the results of the country\u2019s new prosperity are evident in a thriving middle class and a vibrant consumer economy.I visited a family that resided in the largest Falowiec, at Obroncow Wybrzeza Street, right next to a McDonald\u2019s. Michal Jaskiewicz, who lived with his partner and infant son in the building, inherited his 410-square-foot one-bedroom apartment from his grandmother, a member of Solidarity. As he showed me around the Falowiec, he spoke of an aging population, and of how many younger Poles had rejected these Communist buildings. They were inspired instead by a version of what he called \u201cthe American dream\u201d: moving to a stand-alone home in the suburbs, buying a car, commuting to work.We took an elevator to the 10th floor. From up there, it was easier to appreciate the scale of those buildings \u2014 the way they stretched like vast centipedes over the flat land, surging toward the sea. We discussed the curious fate of buildings like these across Poland \u2014 some had been preserved, some had been torn down, others were simply neglected and crumbling into disrepair.Lately, though, Jaskiewicz had noticed a new trend. Many of the same young people who had left these buildings for the suburbs were gradually returning. He explained that, for all the faults of Communist housing, the spaces were actually better thought-out, and in many ways more livable, than the suburban sprawl that members of his generation had sought. The housing estates were self-contained units that included schools, grocery stores, hair salons and a range of other conveniences. He talked of an emerging communist chic that was rejuvenating the reputation of these buildings. Speaking of his own family, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s true these places don\u2019t have such a good reputation. But we have a good life here.\u201dBUT JASKIEWICZ\u2019S GENERATION has a different relationship to history. Many younger Poles, even those who lived through Communism, are far enough removed from its oppressions now that they have a more objective perspective on its legacy, including its architecture. The past still lurks, still haunts, but modern Poland is in many ways less agonized about its history, and more confident, than it was just a few years ago.In Krakow, I went to the Hotel Forum, at the edge of the muddy Vistula River. A jagged concrete structure raised about 100 feet above ground, it was once dubiously described in a guidebook as a bastion of \u201cSoviet hospitality.\u201d The hotel is closed now. A motorcycle racing track has been set up in the parking lot, its piled tires and stench of exhaust indications of another fallen Brutalist behemoth. The back of the building serves as a giant billboard; the day I was there, it sported an ad for a shiny new apartment complex. The irony was inescapable \u2014 I thought of workers being made to train their own outsourced replacements.But the fate of this particular building might in fact be happier than it would have been a couple years ago. Recently, it has found a new life as a hangout for young Poles. When I visited, I found, overlooking the river, a cafe serving burgers and pizza; in the back, in a cavernous space I imagined must have once been the lobby, the sounds of Ping-Pong echoed off the concrete walls. Across the country, as attitudes toward communism ease, many Brutalist structures are similarly being given new, unexpected lives. It was even possible that the decrepit Telpod building I had seen earlier in Krakow would be saved. Recently, a local architecture firm had proposed to redevelop it, transforming it into a \u201cmecca of young creative people and companies.\u201dI visited the Forum with two local architects, Dorota Lesniak-Rychlak and Michal Wisniewski. Together, we wandered its empty halls and then stood outside. The hotel was raised on thick concrete stilts, like massive legs: Really, it was an engineering marvel. I had assumed this was part of its Modernist character (one of the points in Le Corbusier\u2019s well-known manifesto, \u201cFive Points of a New Architecture,\u201d is that buildings should be supported by columns rather than walls). But the architects explained to me that, in fact, the building had been elevated to preserve the view of medieval Krakow for motorists approaching the city from the south. This Modernist icon, in other words, was built with an appreciation for the past.Poland production: Lukasz Dudek at Warsaw CreativesAn earlier version of this article misstated the size of Michal Jaskiewicz's apartment; it is 410 square feet, not 38 square feet.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Khashoggi Killing Overshadows Saudis\u2019 Grand Economic Ambitions", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBEIRUT, Lebanon \u2014 Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia wowed a hall full of global investors with his plan to build a $500 billion city of the future that would attract the world\u2019s brightest minds in business and tech.But that was last year.This year, many of those investors stayed away as the killing of the dissident Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi cast a shadow over the prince\u2019s trademark investment conference and his wider ambitions to reform the kingdom\u2019s economy.\u201cIt is both a political and an economic crisis,\u201d said Karen E. Young, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cThe economic reform agenda is somewhat derailed. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s over, but this is a clear stall, mostly because it\u2019s so dependent on foreign investment and this is the worst timing.\u201dThe Khashoggi crisis began as Saudi Arabia was grappling with low oil prices and struggling to create jobs, lift its private sector and maintain generous, cradle-to-grave benefits for an increasingly youthful population. The international outrage over the killing has amplified those challenges by scaring off many of the foreign partners Crown Prince Mohammed is counting on to help carry out his ambitious reforms.That could leave him in a compromised position, increasingly isolated at home by his swift rise to power and less able than previous royals to wield the kingdom\u2019s mighty checkbook to solve problems at home and abroad.As he rose to the summit of Saudi power over the past three years, Crown Prince Mohammed wooed a range of partners with his vision to transform the kingdom from a hidebound bastion of religious conservatism into a global hub with a diversified economy. To do that, he needed not only to change Saudi society by controlling the clerics and letting women drive, but also to entice foreign investors to join his plans and put their money behind them.The conference, known as the Future Investment Initiative, concluded in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, on Thursday and served as a litmus test of sorts for where the prince\u2019s vast reform efforts stand.Thousands of executives and businessmen still showed up, the government said. Repeat attendees noted fewer Americans and Europeans were present this year, but more Russians, Asians and Arabs. That could indicate a shift in the kingdom\u2019s pursuit of economic partnerships if the scandal over Mr. Khashoggi leads to permanent damage to its relationships with the West, analysts said.Khalid al-Falih, the Saudi energy minister, said more than 25 deals worth $56 billion were signed, most of them with American companies. But $34 billon of those deals were with Saudi Aramco, the state oil monopoly, suggesting that investors are sticking to what Saudi Arabia is best known for.\u201cThe U.S. will remain a key part of the Saudi economy because the interests that tie us are bigger than what is being weakened by the failed boycotting campaign of the conference,\u201d Mr. Falih told Saudi state television.Some of the biggest hits over the Khashoggi case have been in sectors the prince has pitched as emblematic of the new Saudi Arabia.Richard Branson, the chairman of Virgin Group, suspended discussions with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund over a planned $1 billion investment in Virgin\u2019s space ventures.Early this month, Crown Prince Mohammed said that \u201can amazing deal\u201d that would be \u201cfar away from oil\u201d would be announced during the conference. But it never was, raising questions about what other deals had fallen through.In spite of its efforts to court foreign investment, the kingdom has struggled to shake its image as place to get financial help, not to park capital.\u201cWe\u2019re desperate,\u201d he said.He flew home with a $6 billion aid package.King Abdullah II of Jordan also appeared, just months after he had received $2.5 billion in financial aid from Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbors to ease economic distress that had sent his subjects into the streets.Crown Prince Mohammed\u2019s formal appearance on Wednesday also signaled a downgrade.Last year, he had announced plans to build a $500 billion city called NEOM that would be staffed by robots and run on solar power. On stage was Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, whose $100 billion Vision Fund has a $45 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia.This year, however, Mr. Son flew to Riyadh, told the crown prince he would not speak and left.Instead, Crown Prince Mohammed shared the stage with the crown prince of Bahrain, a tiny island nation heavily dependent on Saudi Arabia, and Saad Hariri, the prime minister of Lebanon, which is hardly an economic dynamo.\u201cPeople are still very interested in Saudi Arabia, and the conference drew people because they want Saudi money, they want to sell stuff to Saudi or they want to charge fees in Saudi,\u201d said Steffen Hertog, a scholar of Saudi Arabia at the London School of Economics. \u201cAnd they will continue to try to do that.\u201dWhile the killing of Mr. Khashoggi could have a chilling effect on some sectors, it could also shift the focus away from dreamy projects like NEOM to further development of the kingdom\u2019s economic strengths, which are tied to oil.\u201cBut there is a general risk premium that has gone somewhat up for everyone dealing with Saudi Arabia,\u201d Mr. Hertog said. \u201cThere are questions over leadership, stability and surprises. If Khashoggi doesn\u2019t affect them, what other unexpected shock could happen next?\u201dThe crown prince showed no signs of worry, saying there was no challenge too big for \u201cthe great Saudi people\u201d and that all was on track.\u201cAll of our projects are proceeding, reform is proceeding, our war on extremism is proceeding, our war on terrorism is proceeding, developing the kingdom of Saudi Arabia is proceeding,\u201d he said.He suggested that in five years, Arab countries could be \u201cthe new Europe.\u201dEconomists have pointed to some positive signs. A new bankruptcy law suggests wider regulatory reform, and unemployment has remained stable, despite lackluster job gains. They also cite a rise in women\u2019s employment as well as efforts to replace foreign workers with Saudis in some sectors.Others doubted that the killing of Mr. Khashoggi would fundamentally shift how foreign business people viewed the kingdom. Critics have long blasted Saudi Arabia over human rights issues with little effect on the kingdom\u2019s oil industry or ability to buy arms from countries like the United States. And many business people won\u2019t hesitate to work in authoritarian states if the price is right.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London.Follow Ben Hubbard on Twitter: @NYTBen.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Heat and Drought Could Threaten World Beer Supply ", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by A new study says a warming globe will be bad news for barley, an essential ingredient in the world\u2019s most popular alcoholic beverage. A small international team of scientists considered what the effect of climate change would be for this crop in the next 80 years, and they are raising an alarm they hope will pierce the din of political posturing.They are predicting a beer shortage.Of course it may seem odd, almost irreverent, to concentrate on a cold, foamy recreational beverage, given the damage, real and potential, of climate-influenced natural disasters. Christopher Field, faculty director of the Stanford Woods Institute, who was not involved in the study, said that the report was based on a \u201csolid analysis.\u201d But he wrote in an email, given what is going on in terms of climate change, \u201cIt feels a tad trivial to talk about beer.\u201dOne can only ask: to whom?From Ireland to England, China to the Czech Republic, the love, or \u201clike\u201d of beer has made it the most popular alcoholic beverage on the planet. That is by volume consumed, and what other criterion would you use? One of the authors, Dabo Guan, of Tsinghua University in Beijing and the University of East Anglia, Norwich, said the report was directed at the richer countries of the world, like the United States, to suggest that climate change will hit everyone, not just the poor, who could suffer dire food shortages.\u201cWe will suffer less,\u201d he said, but we will still suffer. Climate change \u201cmay not affect our bread,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it will affect our beer.\u201dThe idea for the study came up at \u2014 where else? \u2014 a bar, Dr. Guan said. It was after a day at a scientific meeting in China, and a few participants had gotten together, including climate scientists, a crop modeler and himself, an economist. His own work, he said, is on international trade. The group had a lot in common, he said: \u201cWe all love beer.\u201d\u201cWe started talking about the agricultural impact of climate change, about food and then beer,\u201d he said. They decided to put together mathematical models of the impact of climate change on barley crops with models of international trade. Seventeen percent of barley is used for beer, he said, while the rest goes mostly to animal feed.The group even came up with a term for beer and some of the other commodities they may study in the future like coffee and chocolate: luxury essentials. You don\u2019t need them to survive, but if you are rich enough to be living in the developed world, you do need them.Dr. Guan also said that the focus should not be on the study\u2019s precise numbers, because the models assume today\u2019s economy. Many things can change. But, he said, the effects are clear.With particularly bad droughts, for example, the price of a bottle of beer in Ireland might double. In the Czech Republic, it could be six or seven times as expensive.China and the United States drink the most beer, because of their populations. \u201cUnder the worst scenario,\u201d he said, China would lose 10 percent of its beer supply and the United States 15 to 20 percent.That won\u2019t happen if Anheuser-Busch has anything to say about it, however. Jess Newman, the company\u2019s director of agronomy in the United States, said, \u201cWe take climate uncertainty very seriously.\u201d To that end, she and her staff keep an eye on climate predictions, breed new strains of barley, and collect data on their own farms and those of suppliers in Montana, Idaho and North Dakota, to determine best practices. \u201cThe barley nerds are on the case,\u201d she said. In terms of how the public should take the news, Dr. Guan was adamant on one point: \u201cOur aim is not to encourage people to drink more beer now.\u201d A good caution, since that might well be the policy solution favored by beer drinkers faced with a possible shortage 80 years in the future. No, he said, sounding a bit like a preacher in a pub: \u201cClimate change mitigation is the only way. Everybody in the world needs to fight.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "She\u2019s a Gun-Owning Democrat. Her Opponent Calls Her an Extreme Liberal.", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byELMIRA, N.Y. \u2014 There is a term that Representative Tom Reed uses for people like his Democratic opponent, Tracy Mitrano: extreme Ithaca liberal.Mr. Reed, a four-term Republican congressman, has used that phrase to describe other vanquished Democratic rivals. He does not care if his opponents are from Ithaca or not.\u201cIt offends Ithacans,\u201d said Don Beachler, an associate professor of political science at Ithaca College, referring to the liberal label. \u201cBut the fact is, Ithaca really is out of sync. Reed may lose by 30 or 40 points in Tompkins County, where Ithaca is located, but carry every other part of the district.\u201dShe won a five-way primary in June but was left with only $8,000 in her campaign account. Her chances in the 23rd Congressional District, where registered Republicans outnumber Democrats by more than 20,000, seemed bleak.\u201cPresident Trump is bringing the disruption to these policies and these areas that he promised he was going to,\u201d Mr. Reed said. \u201cI\u2019ve expressed concerns with his rhetoric and style. But what he is doing is what he set out to do.\u201dOn Thursday, Mr. Trump returned the favor, thanking Mr. Reed on Twitter for his \u201cwonderful comments on our great new Trade Deal with Mexico and Canada.\u201d\u201cI have long ago given you my Full Endorsement,\u201d Mr. Trump continued, \u201cand for good reason.\u201dMs. Mitrano recognizes that Mr. Trump remains popular in the district, which takes in 11 counties along the Pennsylvania border, and stresses her centrist views.She does not support free college tuition, as some progressives do. She is also a proud gun owner and, with the exception of creating \u201cairtight background checks,\u201d she does not believe the federal government should curtail gun ownership. Ms. Mitrano does, however, want to lift the immunity that Congress bestowed on gun manufacturers and sellers in 2005, protecting them from civil suits.At the more liberal end of the policy spectrum, Ms. Mitrano supports Medicare for all, or single-payer health care, but would want to phase it in so as not to sharply increase taxes. By empowering the federal government to negotiate prices, such a system would drive costs down, she said.At a campaign event in Elmira, Ms. Mitrano, who is also a former professor, explained why she jumped into politics. It was Election Day 2016, Ms. Mitrano told the crowd, and she let her class out early that evening.\u201cI went home and I poured myself a little glass of wine and thought I\u2019d watch the results,\u201d she said. \u201cThen, as it was getting a little less propitious, I poured another glass of wine and around 11 o\u2019clock, I picked up the whole damn bottle and drank it straight.\u201dMs. Mitrano, who lives in Penn Yan, a village on Keuka Lake, said she also worried about Russian interference in the election.\u201cBecause I was working in cybersecurity, I wondered, \u2018What is this country going to do?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThe No. 1 thing a government does for you is keep you safe.\u201dIndeed, Ms. Mitrano said that, if elected, she would parlay her expertise not only into strengthening digital security, but into bringing broadband internet to the 23rd District.Many communities lack internet access because companies have no incentive to bring cables to remote areas, she said. Moreover, cell service is spotty, so access via smartphones can be impossible.She told the story of an exasperated mother in the district who, before getting her children ready for bed, has to bundle them in the family\u2019s van. She then idles outside the closed local library, so her child in middle school can pick up the Wi-Fi signal and do his homework.Hey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.She blames Mr. Reed, a staunch believer in limited government, for not doing more to bring constituents into the 21st century. In 2011, he famously introduced a resolution to put a national debt clock in the House chamber as a reminder for members to cut spending.\u201cThat\u2019s not how you help working- and middle-class people survive and thrive,\u201d she said of limiting internet access. \u201cThat\u2019s how you marginalize people.\u201dFor his part, Mr. Reed said he advocates the expansion of broadband. \u201cWe understand the unique challenges that rural businesses, schools and families face,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I voted for the Farm Bill that included $500 million for rural broadband.\u201dMr. Reed, whose campaign had $2.6 million at the end of June, seems to take pleasure in attacking Ms. Mitrano\u2019s positions. In an interview in Horseheads, a farming town outside Elmira, he said single-payer health care would strain an already precarious Medicare system that older people rely on.He asserts that market competition and widespread use of hospice care will reduce health costs.\u201cI\u2019m a hospice volunteer myself,\u201d he said. \u201cIn that last six months of life, we are spending a tremendous amount of health care dollars for a quality of life improvement that is nominal at best.\u201dHe rejects the idea of lifting immunity for gun sellers and manufacturers, with the exception of product liability cases, saying it would prove a \u201cbonanza for personal injury lawyers.\u201d And he castigated Ms. Mitrano for dropping an idea put forward during her primary bid for a national gun registry.\u201cWhat I find is she\u2019ll say whatever she has to do to get votes,\u201d Mr. Reed said.In her defense, Ms. Mitrano said she had no regrets \u201cabout bringing forward a whole lot of ideas\u201d to address gun violence, but had concluded that a registry was \u201ctoo much, too fast.\u201dAnd some Democrats say they admire Mr. Reed\u2019s common touch and easygoing manner.\u201cIf he were my next-door neighbor, it would be fine,\u201d said Alan Cook, a retired bookstore manager, who disagreed with Mr. Reed\u2019s votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act and to enact Mr. Trump\u2019s tax law.Other Democrats say the Everyman personality is an act. Lisa Rustici, a longtime Elmira resident who teaches at Corning Community College, recalled a visit with her book group to Seneca Falls in July. They were celebrating the first women\u2019s rights convention held there in 1848. So was Mr. Reed.After the event, Ms. Rustici and her friends stopped in a store owned by women. \u201cAll of a sudden, the shop owner asked us to leave so that Mr. Reed could come in and shop alone,\u201d she said. \u201cIt said to me, \u2018I\u2019m better than you.\u2019\u201dvideoAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "It\u2019s Time to Talk About the N.R.A.", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "\nThe massacre of 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue a week ago was terrifyingly predictable \u2014 with an equally predictable response. President Trump and members of Congress denounced the violence but show no signs of actually doing anything.Why is it that polls show that voters want more gun safety laws yet Congress can\u2019t pass any? One reason is the National Rifle Association, a heavyweight player in this election and every election. On Tuesday, the N.R.A. once again will help deflect what surveys suggest is the people\u2019s will to stop it.I write this as a former N.R.A. member who grew up on a farm \u2014 my 12th birthday present was my own .22 rifle \u2014 and I acknowledge that it once was a great organization for shooting enthusiasts.But it has been hijacked by extremist leaders committed not to their members\u2019 (much more reasonable) views, but to hard-line resistance of safety regulations. All countries have violent, hateful people, but only in America do we give them ready access to assault weapons and large-capacity magazines, and that\u2019s in part because of the N.R.A. and its political influence.The Second Amendment? Few talked about it. Almost everyone, in and out of the N.R.A., accepted that there should be restrictions on firearms.Visitors to Wichita, Kan., had to check their revolvers at police headquarters. And as for Dodge City, a symbol of the Wild West, a photo shows a sign on main street in 1879 warning: \u201cThe Carrying of Fire Arms Strictly Prohibited.\u201dIn the 1920s and 1930s, the N.R.A. favored tighter gun laws, and its president, Karl Frederick, said that the carrying of weapons \u201cshould be sharply restricted and only under license.\u201d In 1934, the United States helped pioneer modern gun laws with the National Firearms Act, with the blessings of the N.R.A., and came close to banning handguns. As recently as the 1960s, the N.R.A. supported \u2014 more grudgingly \u2014 some limits on guns.But in 1977 there was a coup within the N.R.A. that put hard-liners in charge. The group began calling for repeal of the 1968 Gun Control Act and doubled down on a full-time lobbying arm to oppose firearm restrictions. In effect, the group took an extremist turn that continues to shape American life today.America\u2019s gun culture and Canada\u2019s had been similar in the 1950s and 60s, focused on rifles used for hunting. In 1959, a survey found that 60 percent of Americans favored a ban on handguns. Then in the post-World War II period, other countries steadily tightened gun laws, while in the United States the N.R.A. moved to emphasize handguns and personal security, building on public anxiety about crime, so the United States resisted that global trend and instead passed a series of concealed carry laws.Leaders of the N.R.A. fervently backed a new movement to reinterpret the Second Amendment, which had been regarded as a relic having to do with state militias, as protecting individual gun rights. In 1991, former Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger, a conservative, dismissed calls to reinterpret the Second Amendment as \u201cone of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word \u2018fraud,\u2019 on the American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in my lifetime.\u201dNow that \u201cfraud\u201d is the law of the land.The reinterpretation of the Second Amendment is a tribute to the undeniable effectiveness of the N.R.A. Relentless campaigning by the N.R.A. and changing American mores have resulted in a Constitutional right to bear arms, in a blizzard of concealed carry permits, and in tough stand-your-ground laws. In contrast to Canada, the United States now has a gun culture focused on handguns, assault weapons and paranoia, and that\u2019s in large part because of the N.R.A.Even now, the N.R.A.\u2019s strategy is largely to pounce on liberal comments about \u201cgun control\u201d \u2014 one reason I prefer the less threatening term \u201cgun safety\u201d \u2014 and leverage them to frighten gun owners to become more engaged.

It is a mature business whose products last generations, and whose traditional constituency \u2014 hunters \u2014 is aging and shrinking, and it is also facing the kind of liability risks that struck the tobacco industry. Yet in fact, the gun industry has prospered in recent decades \u2014 in large part because it has been rescued by N.R.A. fear-mongering that drives gun owners to buy more weapons and accessories before they\u2019re banned. This is brilliant marketing.Consider another of the N.R.A.\u2019s current campaigns, to allow silencers. Silencers have been largely banned since the 1930s, but the N.R.A. and enthusiasts like Donald Trump Jr. argue that they should be allowed as a matter of liberty and for health reasons \u2014 to reduce hearing loss associated with gunfire.No one takes this public health argument seriously, but allowing silencers would be a huge boon for the gun industry. If five million Americans each bought a silencer for two firearms, it could amount to $1 billion in sales.Moreover, most firearms today don\u2019t have the threaded barrels needed to accommodate a silencer. So a gun owner who wanted both a rifle and a handgun with silencers would also buy two more firearms \u2014 a further benefit to the industry.Companies show gratitude in other ways. A laser sight maker called Crimson Trace donates 10 percent of certain sales to the organization, and other companies have similar initiatives.The N.R.A. has been admired and feared for decades for its political influence. When Al Gore lost the presidency in 2000, it was widely said that the N.R.A. made the difference.Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia says that the N.R.A.\u2019s power is often attributed to its financial support for candidates, but that its endorsements are far more important. The key, he says, is that many gun rights supporters are single-issue voters, while historically those against the N.R.A. have also cared about the economy, civil rights, foreign policy and so on.Yet there are signs that this is changing, and that N.R.A. influence may have peaked.Even N.R.A. members want some curbs on gunsSolid majorities of N.R.A. members supported these restrictions.Requiring gun retailers to perform background checks on employees to ensure they are not felons79% of NRA members agreeRequiring a criminal background check on anyone purchasing a gun74Prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns71Requiring gun owners to alert police if their guns are lost or stolen64Concealed carry permits should only be granted to applicants \u2026\u2026 who have not committed any violent misdemeanors, such as assault75\u2026 who have completed gun safety training74\u2026 who do not have prior arrests for domestic violence6865\u2026 21 years old or olderSources: poll by Luntz Global, 2012; Mayors Against Illegal GunsEven N.R.A. members want some curbs on gunsSolid majorities of N.R.A. members supported these restrictions.79% of NRA members agreeRequiring gun retailers to perform background checks on employees to ensure they are not felonsRequiring a criminal background check on anyone purchasing a gun74Prohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from purchasing guns71Requiring gun owners to alert police if their guns are lost or stolen64Concealed carry permits should only be granted to applicants \u2026\u2026 who have not committed any violent misdemeanors, such as assault75\u2026 who have completed gun safety training74\u2026 who do not have prior arrests for domestic violence68\u2026 21 years old or older65Sources: poll by Luntz Global, 2012; Mayors Against Illegal GunsViews of the N.R.A.have been mostly positivefavorable6058555351Overall it has been positive since Gallup began tracking it \u2014 except in June 1995, two months after the Oklahoma City terror attack and one month after former president George H.W.

But today they remain legal around the country, and the public has moved on. This underscores the N.R.A.\u2019s success at blocking national regulations, but also the degree to which it is vulnerable for being out of step with public opinion.Even critics of the N.R.A. acknowledge that it also performs a significant public service that liberals rarely acknowledge: It runs gun safety classes around the country.Every year, the N.R.A. trains some 750,000 Americans in gun safety. Sometimes these classes have an ideological tinge, and they often encourage joining the N.R.A. and fighting for Second Amendment rights, but they also train new gun buyers to use a gun reasonably safely.It would be good to see progressive organizations teaching gun safety as well, rather than simply ceding the turf to the N.R.A.My first encounter with the N.R.A. was in a hunter safety class in my hometown of Yamhill, Ore., when I was in seventh grade. At the end of the class, we all received a one-year N.R.A. membership.At the time it was simply a grass-roots organization of hunters and well-meaning sportsmen. But along the way, it morphed into an extremist organization that fights any restrictions on firearms.More guns = more child deathsA comparison of child deaths in the 15 states with the highest household gun ownership and the six states with the lowest.

But children in high-gun states are 2.2 times as likely to be murdered with guns, and almost 9 times as likely to kill themselves with guns, as children in low-gun states.Child homicidesFor each death in low-gun states \u2026\u2026 high-gun states have:2.2By guns1.2Other meansChild suicidesFor each death in low-gun states \u2026\u2026 high-gun states have:8.8By guns1.4Other meansSource: David Hemenway in the American Journal of MedicineThe 15 states with the highest average levels of household gun ownership: Wyoming, Montana, Alaska, South Dakota, Arkansas, West Virginia, Alabama, Idaho, Mississippi, North Dakota, Kentucky, Wisconsin, South Carolina, Utah and Louisiana.

{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: BlackRock\u2019s Fink and Blackstone\u2019s Schwarzman Turn Their Backs on Saudi Arabia", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMore from Andrew and Kate Kelly of the NYT about how this played out:Over the weekend, Mr. Dimon consulted by telephone with two other powerful Wall Street executives, the head of BlackRock, Laurence D. Fink, and Blackstone Group\u2019s chief, Stephen Schwarzman, said two people familiar with the conversations. All three depend on the kingdom for revenue.Mr. Dimon, Mr. Fink and Mr. Schwarzman pressed Saudi officials to postpone the event, the two people said. The three executives and their staffs reached out to the Treasury Department and urged Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to press for the event to be postponed or to publicly make his attendance conditional on more disclosure from the Saudis about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance.Mr. Dimon\u2019s decision follows those of Dara Khosrowshahi of Uber, Bill Ford of Ford Motor and other C.E.O.s. At issue: the disappearance and possible murder of the Saudi exile Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom\u2019s consulate in Istanbul. Saudi officials deny any involvement.Alongside the bankruptcy filing, Mr. Lampert stepped down as Sears\u2019s C.E.O. but will remain chairman. The retailer will close at least 142 stores, and lenders have given it $300 million in loans to keep operating through bankruptcy proceedings, with the aim of preserving the company at least through the holidays.But that lifeline may not be enough for Sears to fix itself and avoid liquidation.Stock markets around the world took a battering last week, as a confluence of factors \u2014 nascent inflation, rising interest rates, tightening fiscal policy and trade tensions \u2014 spooked investors. Overnight, Asian markets dropped, while European ones held their ground.What to look out for:\u2022 Bank earnings are expected to be strong, rising by as much as 41 percent, according to numbers from Refinitiv.\u2022 Energy companies are expected to do well, with profits potentially more than doubling from a year ago.\u2022 Industrial companies may fare worse, as their supply chains take a hit from the extra costs of tariffs.Nothing in the documents suggests Mr. Kushner broke the law, and a spokesman for his lawyer said that he \u201cpaid all taxes due.\u201dNot everyone is convinced it will work. As Derek Scissors of the American Enterprise Institute told the NYT: \u201cWe\u2019ve finessed the public relations problem. But we aren\u2019t really competing with the Chinese.\u201dDiscussion about Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union hit an impasse last night. Dominic Raab, the country\u2019s Brexit secretary, told his European counterpart, Michel Barnier, that his government could not agree to the bloc\u2019s current terms, with Prime Minister Theresa May having called a draft a \u201cnonstarter.\u201dE.U. leaders may conclude there is not sufficient progress to justify proceeding to a special Brexit summit in November to seal a deal, leaving talks in limbo and Britain heading towards an economically damaging \u201cno deal\u201d exit next March.DealsPolitics and policyTradeTechBest of the restThanks for reading!

{"Headline": "The Case of Jane Doe Ponytail", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "An epic tragedy on a small block in Queens.Below awaits 40th Road, a gritty street of commerce in the Flushing section of Queens. Chinese restaurants and narrow storefronts, and dim stairwells leading to private transactions. Strivers and dawdlers and passers-by, all oblivious to what is transpiring above.But before the pavement ends the woman\u2019s descent, a few feet from a restaurant\u2019s glittering Christmas tree, imagine her fall suddenly suspended \u2014 her body freeze-framed in midair. If only for a moment.She toils in the netherworld of Flushing massage parlors, where she goes by the street name of SiSi. A youthful 38, she is in a platonic marriage to a man more than twice her age; harbors fading hopes of American citizenship; and is fond of Heineken, Red Bull and the rotisserie chicken at a Colombian place on Kissena Boulevard. Among her competitors, she is considered territorial and tireless.It is the Saturday after Thanksgiving, and SiSi is in a shabby building\u2019s top-floor apartment, for which she pays her \u201cboss\u201d a hefty fee. She has returned from a market with provisions. She has tried calling her younger brother in China, but he is asleep. She has been on the phone with friends and clients, unaware that she is in the sights of a 10-member police team working vice.She heads downstairs to stand at her building\u2019s entrance, a necessity of her job. Soon she is leading a man back upstairs \u2014 an officer working undercover \u2014 as her closely held cellphone casts a glow about her face. Their awkward conversation in her apartment convinces him that SiSi has broken the law, just as it convinces SiSi that he is a cop. She pushes him out and closes the door, though not to the inevitable. She knows from experience what comes next:More police. Tromping through the dusky vestibule of her building, across the worn scarlet rug and up the 50 tiled steps. Past the Chinese sign that says if you\u2019re looking for the driving school, you\u2019re in the wrong place. Then right to her door.The handcuffs. The hurried escort to a police vehicle. The humiliation. Again.SiSi watches the officers ascend on the video monitor she keeps near the door. Under the fixed gaze of one of those lucky cat figurines perched on a table, its paw raised in a wish of good fortune, she begins to pace.On the narrow balcony, barely two feet deep, she keeps a broom, a bucket and a small blue stool. Up she steps \u2014 and now she is falling, plunging toward the hard tenth of a New York mile that is 40th Road.A tenth of a mile. Where Mandarin trumps English and a glance trumps the spoken word. Where sex is sold beside cloudy tanks of fish and crabs. Where seedy quarters controlled by local powers are rented to illicit massage operations, and the police make sporadic sweeps, and immigrant women are arrested again and again, and few in this city take notice.Gravity prevails.The undercover officer, his job done, exits the building and turns right \u2014 at the very moment that the woman who has just offered him intimacy for money hits the pavement at his feet. A woman known along 40th Road as SiSi, but whose given name was Song Yang.A striving borough of comity and contradiction, Queens is both the birthplace of the American president \u2014 elected in part on an anti-immigration platform \u2014 and home to 2.3 million people, nearly half of them foreign-born. With hundreds of languages spoken here, it may be the most linguistically diverse place on earth.Every day, airplanes alight at Kennedy International Airport in southeast Queens, their passengers including many immigrants who join the borough\u2019s anonymous, aspirational ranks. They chop the vegetables, wash the dishes, clean the toilets, mow the lawns, drive the hired cars.And some wind up in the commercial sex trade. Making money for a pimp in an airport motel in South Jamaica. Waiting for the next client in a dingy building along Roosevelt Avenue in Corona. Or, like Song Yang, standing on a Flushing street on a cold November night, hiding behind her cute nickname, calling out to men. Playing her role in a shadow economy that benefited others through the exorbitant rent she paid.\u201cI hear she was No. 1: young, pretty, and her service was great,\u201d said Michael Chu, a travel agent and community advocate who worked across the street from her on 40th Road. \u201cPeople just lined up for her.\u201dFor years now, Flushing has been an ever-replenishing repository of immigrants entangled in the underground sex economy. The commonplace raids of illicit massage operations across the country routinely lead to the arrests of women with Flushing addresses.These parlors disappear and reappear with regularity, undermining the police crackdowns often prompted by neighborhood complaints. The industry\u2019s opaqueness adds to the confusion. Some parlors have legitimate state licenses; some legitimate operations have masseuses making sex-for-money side deals; and some are illegally unlicensed, with no interest at all in addressing someone\u2019s sore neck.Emotionally manipulated by their bosses, ashamed of what they do, afraid to trust, the women rarely confide in the police or even their lawyers about their circumstances. They might be supporting a family in China, or paying back a smuggling debt, or choosing this more profitable endeavor over, say, restaurant work. No matter the backstory, the police say their collective silence further complicates law-enforcement efforts to build racketeering and trafficking cases against the operators.But society has become increasingly aware of the complexities and inequities of the commercial sex economy, including a criminal justice system that has tended to target the exploited \u2014 often immigrant women and members of the transgender community \u2014 while rarely holding accountable their customers and traffickers.In early 2017, New York\u2019s police commissioner, James O\u2019Neill, announced at a news conference that he would redirect his vice division to address prostitution and sex trafficking. This would include training intended to alter what he called the \u201claw-enforcement mind-set.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve already switched much of our emphasis away from prostitutes, and begun focusing much more on the pimps who sell them and the johns who pay for their services,\u201d he said. \u201cLike all crime, we can\u2019t just arrest our way out of this problem.\u201dSince the establishment of this new \u201cmind-set,\u201d the police have continued to struggle at building criminal cases against the operators. But prostitution arrests in New York City have dropped more than 20 percent in the last year, while the arrests of customers have spiked.Still, this change in attitude at Police Headquarters in Lower Manhattan had not necessarily crossed the East River to benefit an immigrant now lying on her side, unable to speak, gazing up at a plainclothes officer trying to calm her until an ambulance arrived. Beside a spent cigarette, her blood pooled on the pavement she had so often worked.By morning, Song Yang would be dead, shattering a tight Chinese family that would never accept the police version of events. Her death would also come to reflect the seemingly intractable nature of policing the sex industry, and cast an unwelcome light on the furtive but ubiquitous business of illicit massage parlors.In the epic of Queens, this stretch of 40th Road is little more than an asphalt hyphen. But along its short expanse exist worlds within worlds within worlds.I want to go to work, the little girl would say to her parents. I want to pick ginseng. She was a born worker, their Song Yang.She and her younger brother lived with their parents in a remote village in China\u2019s northeastern province of Liaoning, where they grew crops on land allotted to them by their local village committee. Little Song Yang was especially efficient at harvesting the family\u2019s ginseng crop, her mother, Shi Yumei, recalled. \u201cThe more her father praised her, the harder she worked.\u201dHer father, Song Xigui, eventually found moderate success selling construction-grade sand he bulldozed from a nearby river, and by the 1990s the family had replaced its thatched-roof home with a modern brick house that included two \u201ckang\u201d bed-stoves, heated slate platforms that provided warmth during the severe winters. Still, they continued to work the crops, with Song Yang often responsible for running home to light the stove, cut the vegetables and mind her brother.As she grew older, she began to collect specimens of the enchanting butterflies zigzagging down by the river, and became meticulous in preserving their fragile iridescence. When friends came for boisterous sleepovers, they would marvel at her book of butterflies, and take turns asking to keep one.Butterflies became Song Yang\u2019s gift.At 19, she moved 2,200 miles south to Saipan, the largest of the Northern Mariana Islands, an American commonwealth, where she became one of the thousands of young Chinese women who labored in sweatshops to produce apparel bearing the guilt-absolving label \u201cMade in America.\u201d Sharing a room with five other women in a dormitory, she covered her bottom-bunk bed with a silken cloth curtain, and adorned her small rectangle of privacy with family photographs.Saipan\u2019s garment industry was shrinking by the early 2000s, and Song Yang left to become a waitress on the island. She married a worldly divorced father named Chau Chuong, an American citizen who had worked for years in New York\u2019s restaurant grind. He was so much older \u2014 67 to her 27 \u2014 that her family was slow to accept him.In 2006, the couple opened a small Vietnamese restaurant on Saipan that became so successful they opened a second place, with 150 tables. He worked the kitchen and she worked the front. \u201cShe attracted a lot of friendly customers,\u201d her husband recalled.Her brother, Song Hai, joined her after his high school graduation, eventually opening a henna tattoo parlor with a friend. When their mother came for a visit, she posed for photographs beside her daughter\u2019s well-stocked restaurant bar, her smile radiating pride.\u201cWe had a real sense of accomplishment,\u201d Mr. Song said in Mandarin.But a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami struck Japan in 2011, disrupting a main source of tourism to Saipan, as well as the fortunes of Song Yang and Song Hai. The restaurants were sold, the tattoo parlor shuttered.Photographs from her brother\u2019s wedding in March 2013 capture the last happy times that Song Yang spent with her family. Here she is back home, posing with the bride and groom. Here she is, sharing a restaurant meal with the growing family. Here she is.A month later, Song Yang joined the hundreds who arrive daily at Kennedy Airport, direct from China. Straight to Flushing she went, like so many before, where she hoped that she and her husband would succeed again as restaurateurs.But there is the dream of Flushing, and the reality.With her husband now too old for kitchen work, Song Yang became their sole source of income. A waitressing job failed, as did a short-lived Chinese fast-food venture on Main Street. So she became a home health aide, and took a massage-therapy course in the hope of earning additional money. Then a friend told her of a more lucrative opportunity, to be found along 40th Road.The understanding of her parents and brother was that Song Yang worked in reflexology. They knew that gifts arrived from New York. That she called regularly for video chats while sitting in a black office chair, sometimes eating a bowl of porridge. That when her nephew was born, she proudly announced on social media that she had become an aunt \u2014 a \u201cgugu.\u201dThat she seemed happy, mostly. But there was that time when she refused to video-chat for several days, after which she explained that a man had beaten her about the face. And that other time, when she revealed that a man \u2014 a law-enforcement officer, she said \u2014 had held a gun to her head while forcing her to perform oral sex. Family members reassured her: She had no choice.Song Yang told her family last fall that she had booked a flight to China for December, and was looking forward to meeting her nephew for the first time. So far she had connected with him only online, through the popular WeChat app, where her avatar sometimes featured a butterfly.In the 19th century it had a volunteer firehouse, a nursery and residents with Irish surnames. Just in living memory, there was Harry Barlow\u2019s auto garage, the mimeograph services of Case the Printer, an appliance store proud of its color Zenith television sets and, of course, the Old Roma restaurant \u2014 famous for its veal cutlets on linguine, and that yellow sponge cake with pineapple filling.It is all long gone, replaced by ginger duck rice casserole and a shaved ice treat called red bean baobing. The 40th Road of today is almost entirely Chinese, its restaurant signs often featuring no English at all \u2014 one more reminder that the only New York constant is change.The street\u2019s 20 buildings, including Song Yang\u2019s, are mostly three- and four-story structures from the 1980s and \u201990s that evoke a utilitarian, Soviet-bloc drabness. Narrow and claustrophobic, they loom like set pieces for a film noir.The one-way street itself always feels like a wrong turn, an obstacle course of idling delivery trucks and construction equipment. One end elbows past a small playground; the other runs into the ever-clogged Main Street intersection, where plainclothes police officers can often be seen sitting in an unmarked vehicle in an attempt to deter quality-of-life crimes. Pickpocketing is so prevalent that a nearby grocery displays signs of a stick figure reaching into another stick figure\u2019s handbag.Above, looming airliners grumble as they approach LaGuardia Airport, across Flushing Bay. Just behind 40th Road, Long Island Rail Road trains grind and whine along the raised tracks. Up and down the block, the earthy aromas of produce stands and restaurant waste commingle with the classical Chinese instrumental music emanating from a soup-dumpling restaurant.And here, beside the upturned fruit crates and the overloaded garbage bags, stand the women of the massage parlors. In their 40s and 50s, mostly, they check their cellphones, drag on untaxed Korean cigarettes bought in bulk, and chat, but with eyes scanning for unattached men lacking a law-enforcement vibe.Massage?The offer is understood, if not explicit. If the man consents, he is led up the stairs of one of the dull buildings, where massage operations are often crammed amid barbershops, driving schools and employment agencies.Massage parlors offering sex are hardly a recent phenomenon, and business models vary. But the trade along 40th Road is especially audacious. The women stand on both sides of the street \u2014 five, 10, a dozen at a time \u2014 as ubiquitous as the delivery trucks. In the merciless heat and cold, they sweat and shiver on staked ground, prompting resentful neighborhood complaints about lost business and children exposed to the seamy daily spectacle.A common arrangement on 40th Road is one in which a \u201cboss\u201d rents an apartment or office from one of the building\u2019s tenants, then provides space to women for a $20 cut of whatever they charge each client. The general expectation is that each woman will generate at least $100 a day for the boss.But the bosses provide no meaningful protection. The women are at the mercy of the street, where they have been robbed, beaten, raped, thrown down stairs. The surveillance cameras nearly always present are intended less for security, perhaps, than to provide the boss with a way to count the clients who walk through the door.Over several months, the women along 40th Road shared in Mandarin the stories of how they came to be standing here, offering sex to strangers. They use names like masks. Some have chosen Americanized names \u2014 Jenny, for example \u2014 while others have been rechristened by bosses with nicknames that sound like Lala, or Kiki, or Yoyo.They came from all over China, and from myriad backgrounds. One woman said she used to clean houses. Another said she was a former reporter who covered Chinese real estate. Several described the circumstances that left them in economic straits: a failed bus company, a bankrupt jade dealership, a gambling-addicted husband.One woman often positions herself near a standpipe at the corner of Main Street, so as to be the first to approach any man venturing west. She is in her 60s, small-framed and usually dressed in layers, with long hair dyed black. She said in a raspy voice that she was from the southeastern Chinese province of Jiangxi, and that she was trying to pay off a debt incurred by her adult son in a business deal gone wrong.She had visited two job agencies on 40th Road, looking for work as a nanny, but nothing panned out. And now she was here, on the corner, where her half-joking refrain \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m too old\u201d \u2014 did not seem to deter clients.Another woman, who gave her name as Xiao Li \u2014 or Little Li \u2014 said she was from the city of Dexing, in Jiangxi Province, home to a well-known copper mine, where she once was a welder. Thin and often wearing a simple black dress, she said she had briefly left the street to study legitimate massage \u2014 \u201cSo my heart could have a little bit of peace\u201d \u2014 but had concluded that the classes were a waste of money. Back she came to 40th Road.\u201cMy body can\u2019t take it,\u201d Ms. Li, 50, said. \u201cMy body can\u2019t take so many men.\u201dOthers were even more expansive, including a stocky, 40-ish woman with cropped black hair and a lazy eye who called herself Rachel. Eating a sweet baked potato at a dumpling stall on Main Street, she recalled that while working at a job she loathed \u2014 waitressing at a Chinese restaurant in Seattle \u2014 she began hunting through WeChat forums for leads on other work, and came across an offer that she recalled saying:Massage Woman to Stand on Street. $20,000 a month. Flushing, N.Y.Rachel called the number to ask what the job entailed. The boss replied: Everything.After her first day, Rachel said, \u201cI got home and took a shower, and cried.\u201dShe paused at the memory, and added, \u201cBut then I just thought to myself, \u2018I have to keep thinking positively.\u2019\u201dMichael Chu, the longtime neighborhood advocate, has befriended some of the women who stand outside his building on 40th Road, and occasionally offers them assistance with police matters. His office, where an old dog named Scout is usually napping on some cardboard, is furnished with desks left behind by an accountant who moved rather than work beside a massage parlor.A bespectacled man of 65, Mr. Chu has listened to the travails of these women, whom he calls \u201csisters.\u201d The beatings, the robberies, the harassment from teenagers in the playground, the pressure to attract enough clients to cover their \u201crent\u201d to the boss. The hopes they harbor for permanent residence, for having enough money, for finally not doing this.\u201cThey also have an American dream,\u201d Mr. Chu said. \u201cThe sisters have an American dream.\u201dHis was Paul Hayes. Single, in his early 40s and living in Queens, he carried himself with a seen-it-all air \u2014 but she beguiled him. They gradually became lovers, then good friends with vague plans to rekindle their romance someday. But she lived with her husband in an apartment a block away. It was complicated.She had a good sense of humor, and often solicited his advice \u2014 although she ignored him when he recommended bolstering the building\u2019s security system. She also confided about the dangers and vagaries of her work life.\u201cShe really hated doing it,\u201d Mr. Hayes said.Even so, Song Yang established herself as a fierce competitor in the circumscribed world of 40th Road. Fueled by coffee and Red Bull, she toiled nearly nonstop, as if facing some self-imposed deadline. Word was that she was trying to save up to open her own Vietnamese restaurant, or to buy a house in New York for her aging parents, or to just move on.Her sharp elbows and inexhaustible style irked some of the other women, leading to arguments, shoves and occasional hair pulling. One competitor recalled that if a man chose another masseuse, Song Yang would tease the client about preferring older women.But another woman remembered a gentler, more generous Song Yang. She said that when she arrived at 40th Road, Song Yang insisted that she accept several pairs of pants to ward against winter.Song Yang\u2019s domain was a fourth-floor apartment at 135-32 40th Road, directly above another massage operation. The apartment door faced a boiler room and a makeshift gate that was intended to keep vagrants from sleeping on the roof, but also to protect the hot pepper plants nurtured there by the aged custodian.As were most things on 40th Road, her rental arrangement was convoluted.The building was constructed in 1992 by Jentai Tsai, 85, a prominent, even revered, banker in Flushing, and is owned by a real estate company overseen by his son, Eugene Morimoto Tsai. In a brief conversation last month, the younger Tsai, 42, said that he did not know that a woman had fallen from his building last year, or that his building had long been a hub of illicit massage activity.They both said, and city records confirm, that the building\u2019s managing agent \u2014 responsible for collecting rent \u2014 was another man of local distinction: Peter Tu, 62, the longtime director of the Flushing Chinese Business Association, a member of Community Board 7 and a district leader for the Democratic Party.Outside his office around the corner, Mr. Tu at first denied that he was involved with the 40th Road building, but then said that he had merely tried to assist the Tsai family by collecting the $18,500 monthly rent from the main, first-floor tenant, the Shi Li Xiang seafood restaurant. He said he no longer served in this role, had never taken any payment \u201cfrom the street,\u201d and had no idea what arrangements the restaurant had with the tenants and subtenants upstairs.\u201cI\u2019m always in the middle,\u201d Mr. Tu said.A man identifying himself as the boss of the first-floor restaurant began to shout when asked about the tenants upstairs. \u201cHow am I supposed to know the names of the people to whom I rent?\u201d he asked in Mandarin. \u201cYou want me to go up and ask everyone who they are?\u201dAbove the restaurant, in this building owned and managed by Flushing men of stature, Song Yang paid a flat fee for her apartment \u2014 as much as $400 a night, competitors say \u2014 to a square-headed, elusive \u201cboss\u201d who goes by Lao Li, or Old Li, a kind of avuncular nickname conveying familiarity with the women who work for him. But the particulars of his subleasing arrangements are as difficult to pin down as he is.One spring midnight, Lao Li made a rare appearance on 40th Road to mediate a dispute over clients that had erupted among the women. When a reporter approached and called him by name, Lao Li looked up \u2014 and bolted. He dashed east down the center of 40th Road, dodging cars, before vanishing into the dark Flushing night.Although Song Yang and other women often quarreled, they occasionally gathered with Lao Li at the restaurant downstairs, or at a nearby karaoke bar. They\u2019d watch him blow out a candle on his birthday cake, or sing along to a song popular in his native northeast China. At the Chinese New Year, he would hand out red envelopes containing small cash gifts.In cellphone videos and photographs of these get-togethers, the participants could easily be mistaken for co-workers at an accounting firm, making a night of it. They seemed untroubled by their profession\u2019s many perils, including robbery, bodily harm \u2014 and, especially, arrest.Arrest attracted unwelcome attention. It jeopardized applications for permanent residency. It magnified the humiliation. And it usually meant an appearance at the Human Trafficking Intervention Court, held on Fridays in the basement of the Queens Criminal Court in Kew Gardens, where Mandarin sometimes seems as common as English.Established nearly 15 years ago, the court set out to treat women in the commercial sex trade less as accused criminals than as victims of trafficking and exploitation. They are told that charges will be dismissed and records sealed if they complete several individualized counseling sessions \u2014 focused, say, on job training, or education \u2014 with Garden of Hope, Restore NYC, Womankind or another outreach organization. A group called Sanctuary for Families is also on hand to provide immigration services.Song Yang went through this process more than once. In addition to expunging the arrests from her record, these court appearances provided pause, forcing her to confront the consequences of her work life.In the summer of 2016, Song Yang began frequent WeChat dialogues with a Flushing lawyer, Chen Mingli, that at first focused on acquiring permanent residency \u2014 a process that he repeatedly told her could take months and months. Still, she fretted that her arrest history would thwart her application for a green card.Gradually, though, their conversations came to reflect the darker realities of her 40th Road realm, with sobbing emoticons peppering her messages.Mr. Chen assured her that the matter would not affect the status of her immigration case, and implored her to cooperate with the police. But her intense desire to avoid attention, coupled with fear of retaliation from her attacker, overshadowed everything.The police circulated a wanted poster based on a hazy photograph of the man lifted from the surveillance video. A retired United States Marshal, who surrendered after someone mentioned him as a possible suspect, participated in a lineup.But Song Yang identified another man, wrongly, as her attacker. In addition, a DNA sample from the retired marshal did not match samples taken from Song Yang\u2019s clothing. The case was eventually closed.Several months later, in late September 2017, she was arrested a third time on a prostitution charge. Handcuffed, led away from 40th Road, held overnight.Song Yang answered:She explained that she had been forced to make hard decisions and that it had been difficult to suppress her feelings while married to a much older man who seemed increasingly removed from her day-to-day life. She felt \u201cmorally depraved,\u201d and sometimes thought about giving it all up and going home \u2014 or worse.Mr. Chen was never formally hired by Song Yang, but now his central role seemed to be to buoy her spirits.Song Yang only sank deeper.I\u2019ve fallen so low I can\u2019t be saved.She continued:Without purpose, without direction, what meaning is there to keep on living? I used to be a woman who was very strong in her life. I strove for perfection in everything I did. I never thought that my life would turn out this way. I\u2019ve truly failed.At the end of October, Song Yang made one last visit to Mr. Chen\u2019s office. She confided that another client had badly beaten her a couple of weeks earlier \u2014 an assault she had not reported to the police \u2014 and showed him photographs of her bruised and swollen face.\u201cWhy am I so unlucky?\u201d he remembers her asking.The tip hardly came as a revelation, since shady activities at this address had generated scores of 911 calls over the years. To some, the building even had the aura of being cursed, following a horrific crime in 2010, in which a deranged stalker stabbed a woman in the second-floor hallway and removed her heart and lungs.Forty-three arrests had taken place in the building over the last decade, more than a few sex-related, the most recent that of Song Yang. Ensnared in an undercover sting in late September, she had tried but failed to hide in the cramped boiler room across from her apartment, and was charged with offering sex for $70.Her case, which had prompted those despairing messages to the lawyer Mr. Chen, was one of 91 massage-parlor-related arrests in the 109th Precinct in 2017, and one of six along 40th Road. According to court records, none of those arrests were for pimping, solicitation or operating an unlicensed massage parlor.The police later determined that the sign actually said, \u201cAttention, the driving school is on the third floor next door.\u201dAn undercover officer then telephoned a woman associated with the building who was known as SiSi. They arranged an appointment for the next evening, Saturday, Nov. 25. Her price: $120.On the appointed day, members of the Queens North Vice Enforcement Squad met at their base in College Point to discuss the seven locations they planned to hit that night. The closest target became the first: the bleak building at 135-32 40th Road.The vice officers went over their safety plan. They chose their identifying color of the day. They agreed upon the mission\u2019s assorted distress signals and code words, including what the primary undercover officer would say to indicate that sex had been offered for money. Now they were ready.The 10-member team headed out into the evening, unseasonably mild for late November. They parked along Prince Street, across from the White Bear dumpling place and just short of where the one-way street bends east to become 40th Road. The team leader and two arresting officers sat in the first car, with two more arresting officers in the second car. The third vehicle was for prisoner transport.The team tested its recording device, which used Bluetooth to transmit one-way audio. No problem. The green light was given: Go.Minutes later, the undercover officer approached his target, Song Yang, just inside her building\u2019s entrance. He wore an olive-green jacket, jeans and a cap. She wore a short winter coat, a red-and-black scarf, leggings and one of her signature headbands \u2014 with a small bow that resembled a butterfly.The officer could not have known that this woman had just attempted a video chat with her younger brother, who was still asleep in China. That she had plans to fly home in December. That she had kept her court-mandated appointments with Restore NYC, a nonprofit organization that helps foreign-born victims of sex trafficking. That her fifth and last session with Restore was four days away.About all he knew was her police nickname for the night: \u201cJD Ponytail.\u201dJane Doe Ponytail.She led him up the worn stairs. She gave him a peck of a kiss in the hall, and opened her apartment door. Another woman, brand-new to Flushing and known as Momo, was already occupied with a man in the second bedroom.Song Yang walked her client to her bedroom, where, according to the police, she offered sexual intercourse for the reduced price of $80. He consented to the arrangement and, heading to the bathroom, managed to utter the code word into his transmitter that a positive \u2014 that is, illegal \u2014 agreement had been reached. He also hoped to signal to colleagues that it was time to move in, but a wary Song Yang prevented him from having privacy, telling him to keep the bathroom door open.\u201cThis is bad service,\u201d the officer said.Responding to the undercover officer\u2019s signal, the three idling police vehicles turned onto 40th Road, smack into its everlasting gridlock. Four officers got out and hustled to the building. Climbing the dreary stairs, they passed their undercover colleague, who pointed to Song Yang\u2019s door as he descended \u2014 and as she watched on the monitor in her apartment.With the police demanding that she open the door, and preparing to break it down, a panicked Song Yang hurried to the apartment\u2019s north balcony. The other woman, Momo, emerged naked from her bedroom to investigate the noise, but hustled back to hide when she realized it was the police.The balcony was not equipped with surveillance cameras, leaving what happened next to the imagination. It is possible that Song Yang was hoping to escape, perhaps by reaching for a wire that ran vertically past her balcony. It is possible that she was trying to land on the protruding metal sign of the restaurant below. It is also possible that she intended to kill herself.It is fact that she hit the pavement directly in front of the undercover officer she had pecked on the cheek just five minutes earlier. His supervisors say that the officer remains shaken to this day.Later that night, while Song Yang was lying in a hospital bed with multiple fractures to her face, head and body, the police placed her under arrest. She died in the morning \u2014 and the arrest was, in the parlance of the police, \u201cvoided.\u201dSong Yang\u2019s mother and brother had traveled 7,000 miles to better understand the how and the why of her death.Her distraught parents had telephoned their other child, Song Hai, to deliver words so heavy that he dropped his smartphone, cracking its glass. Not accepting what he heard, he sent a WeChat message to his sister that depicted a pair of clinking coffee mugs, along with a gentle request to please call home.The lack of an answer was the answer.The mother and brother spent their first two weeks in Flushing tending to the affairs of death. Then, on a dismal day of late December rain, they made their way to the Chun Fook funeral home, a few blocks from 40th Road. Though some had recommended a modest ceremony, the family had insisted on a more elaborate service, in a spacious room with a chandelier.The dark wood coffin sat at the front before rows of chairs that would remain empty. No women from 40th Road. No Lao Li. A pair of vertical scrolls with parallel aphorisms written in Chinese calligraphy \u2014 \u201cPut Down Your Burdens and Return to the Lord\u201d and \u201cTake Up Tranquillity and Celebrate Everlasting Life\u201d \u2014 hung on either side.One minister delivered prayers in English, while another repeated those prayers in Mandarin. The few mourners included Song Yang\u2019s close friend Paul Hayes; the community advocate Michael Chu; Chen Mingli, the lawyer who had tried to help her seek permanent residency; her husband, Chau Chuong, now 78, who had come from California, where he had been living for his health; and her mother and brother, their heads bowed and hands folded.Then it was a short drive along the Grand Central Parkway to the All Souls Chapel and Crematory at St. Michael\u2019s Cemetery. This is where Song Yang\u2019s battered body was returned to dust, and where, in his frustration and grief, her brother vowed justice and punched a wall.The official explanation for his only sibling\u2019s death made no sense to Mr. Song. After all, she had already paid for her flight home to celebrate their mother\u2019s upcoming birthday and to meet, for the first time, his 5-year-old son. Suicide was not possible, he reasoned. Darker forces might be at play. He had already begun his own investigation.One snowy night soon after arriving from China, Mr. Song appeared at his sister\u2019s 40th Road building with Mr. Hayes. Their plan was to break into her apartment, collect her belongings \u2014 and, if possible, retrieve any surveillance video.Mr. Song, a learning specialist by trade, and Mr. Hayes, a computer consultant, crept up the 50 tiled steps to the fourth-floor door, which was secured with a locked chain. Fearing the noise of the hammer and small acetylene torch they had planned to use, Mr. Hayes hustled to a Home Depot a mile away and returned with a hacksaw.After a few minutes of sawing, the chain gave way, and the two men pushed open the dull-gray door to enter the setting of a life interrupted. The police had taken the surveillance equipment, but everything else made it seem as if Song Yang might return at any minute.In the two bedrooms, rumpled sheets. In the kitchen, a Pepsi and a half-empty bottle of Bacardi, sliced carrots and apples, and the black chair that Mr. Song recognized as the one his sister sat in while video-chatting with her family. In the living room, a raised table with a red curtained skirt, on which sat a CD player, a pair of sunglasses and a lucky cat figurine. Placed neatly on the floor, a pair of pink shoes.On the snow-dusted front balcony, a broom, an upside-down bucket, a stool, a few plastic bags containing fruit and eggs. And, just beyond, the beckoning lights and shadows of the street below.His ever-evolving theory:That his sister had been sexually assaulted by a police officer. That she had filed a complaint. That the subsequent police lineup was fixed to protect the assailant. Then it was payback, which explained why, of all the women along 40th Road, only Song Yang was arrested in September, and was about to be arrested again in late November.As is standard when a death occurs during a police action, the Queens district attorney and the police department\u2019s Force Investigation Division were investigating. But Mr. Song was already beginning to believe that nearly every corner of the American criminal justice system \u2014 from the police to the medical examiner \u2014 was colluding to hide the truth.He patrolled downtown Flushing. He interrogated women and shopkeepers. He plastered the streets with leaflets featuring photographs of his sister and promising a \u201cBig Reward!\u201d The plea appeared in Chinese and in fractured English:Hello! When you saw the photo, SiSi (Song Yang) was no longer alive. She fell from and died on 11/25/2017 at 135-32 4FL in Flushing. Families as well as the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau are eager to find out the truth of her death. If you have ANY CLUES, please contact me ASAP. Absolutely Confidential \u2026 (Her brother Song Hai)His sleuthing occasionally paid off. One evening, amid the Main Street crush, Mr. Song spotted a man he recognized from his sister\u2019s WeChat photographs: short, solidly built, and with a distinctive, block-shaped head.Excited, Mr. Song crossed the street and, right at the Roosevelt Avenue intersection, near the subway entrance, grabbed the man by the arm. Mr. Song recalled what happened next:The two officers understood Mr. Song\u2019s intentions, he later recalled, but they explained that this was America, not China, and that he was unlawfully detaining a man who wasn\u2019t present when his sister\u2019s fall took place. They separated the men, and Lao Li floated away in the rush-hour stream.Later that evening, an angry Lao Li telephoned Mr. Song. In the conversation that Mr. Song duly recorded on his phone, Lao Li vented about the audacity of summoning the police \u2014 \u201cIf you don\u2019t have evidence, how could you say I\u2019m the boss?\u201d \u2014 before giving his version of the realities on 40th Road.He said that he rented the apartment to Song Yang for $3,100 a month \u2014 hardly the $12,000 that was rumored on the street. \u201cShe and I really didn\u2019t have any employment relationship,\u201d he said. \u201cJust that at the start of the month, I would take the rent.\u201dLao Li said she called him her \u201cboss\u201d so that others wouldn\u2019t bully her, but he insisted that she was her own boss: prone to arrest, sure, but also smart, tenacious and tough.Throughout the conversation, Lao Li characteristically remained at a distance \u2014 even when describing that fateful night. He rushed to 40th Road after receiving a call that \u201cSiSi had jumped from the building,\u201d he said, but by the time he got there, \u201cyour sister had already been taken away.\u201dAs Mr. Song conducted his frustrating investigation, his mother spent her days in the numbing cocoon of grief. Once so proud of her entrepreneurial children, Shi Yumei was now a sorrowful woman in a foreign world, gingerly navigating a small cart down crowded Main Street, her pale gray knit cap pulled low, her mind occupied with worry. How, for example, would she and her son, here on temporary visas, survive on the little money they had brought with them?An encounter with a bellowing street evangelist eventually led her to St. George\u2019s, the old Episcopal church on Main Street whose steeple has long been a Flushing landmark. Its congregation embraced her, smothering her with food, clothing and compassion. Locking hands and forming a prayer circle one day, strangers asked God to grant peace to this new person among them, who felt so blessed that she began to volunteer at the church\u2019s food pantry as a way of giving back.One cool April morning, she donned an orange apron and joined 40 other volunteers, nearly all of them immigrants, as they prepared for the ritual that unfolds every Wednesday along the old church\u2019s north side, opposite a Lucille Roberts fitness center. They unloaded the crates from trucks, bagged the fruit and vegetables, and established an assembly line of food down the sidewalk: turnips and fennel, lettuce and apples, onions and melons.The decade-old operation had gradually adapted to the ways of Flushing, with organizers taking note of the tensions caused by different understandings of personal space among ethnic groups. The solution: two alternating lines \u2014 one that was entirely Asian, and the other a mix of black, white and Latino.On this morning, the Asian line ran alongside the church\u2019s cemetery wall, and the other line stretched down to a firehouse. But things moved apace, thanks in large part to the high-spirited efficiency of the volunteers \u2014 including Shi Yumei, who smiled at her sense of belonging as she proffered bags of onions.Each evening, after long days of volunteering and investigating, mother and son returned to a worn apartment catering to transients, not far from 40th Road. Some lodgers paid $20 a night for a narrow bed in the living room. But with some financial help from the church and a few nonprofit organizations, Mr. Song and Ms. Shi managed to pay $1,000 a month for a cramped bedroom and first dibs on a shared kitchen.They slept beside a closet packed with clothes and accessories that Song Yang left behind. Tears were shed over a single strand of black hair found on a coat. They lived in the presence of her absence.To find sleep, the mother would hold a small audio device close to her ear and listen to lively recorded stories about historical Chinese triumphs, cuddled beside one of her daughter\u2019s plush teddy bears. This way, Ms. Shi said in Mandarin, \u201cI know my daughter is here with me.\u201dTwo feet away, her son would lie in his twin bed near the window, cigarettes on the nightstand, spent beer cans under the bed, another Long Island Rail Road train clattering in the distance. Here he would try to piece together the stray bits of his investigation.He had found a grainy photograph from his sister\u2019s WeChat feed of the stocky, bald man who had supposedly sexually assaulted her, and convinced himself that a bald police detective, appearing in cellphone videos taken on the sidewalk after his sister\u2019s fall, was the same man.He had also obtained photographs and forensic notes from the autopsy. Poring over the graphic images, he decided that the discoloration around his sister\u2019s face came from a beating, and that her broken fingernails suggested some kind of struggle \u2014 and, therefore, a cover-up.This was America. Not China. Exactly.They took their seats among the defendants, including a woman in glasses often seen calling out to men on 40th Road. Mr. Song sat with his hands clasped and back erect; his mother was bent forward, as if in prayer. They waited.An air of empathy defines the court, which is intended to encourage women engaged in the commercial sex trade to avail themselves of counseling and other diversionary programs. On most Fridays, the judge, the prosecutor and the defense lawyer are women, and the lanky head court officer is determined to make the defendants feel safe and respected. He does his best to dissuade any pimps or bosses from taking a seat.Prominent in the dozen pews are Chinese women facing the usual massage-parlor-related charges of prostitution or unlicensed massage. Court-appointed lawyers from the Legal Aid Society or Queens Law Associates usually guide them through the process, along with a Mandarin-speaking interpreter and advocates from one of the nonprofit groups specializing in sex-trafficking outreach and immigration services.Defenders of the program maintain that until a better approach is developed, arrests \u2014 followed by appearances in trafficking court \u2014 provide the best chance for intervention. Even if a woman returns to 40th Road, they say, she will at least have the names of people to contact if she needs help.Others, though, counter that for many women caught in the commercial sex trade, an arrest only exacerbates their trauma. Besides, they say, one doesn\u2019t need to be arrested in order to receive helpful contact information.Judge Toko Serita, who has presided over the trafficking court for a decade, summons the defendants, one by one, to stand before her, as a court officer calls out, \u201cMandarin interpreter required, and present.\u201d The judge has short black hair, glasses and a welcoming, even reassuring demeanor, whether it\u2019s the defendant\u2019s first appearance or her last.How are you today? \u2026 Are you studying English? \u2026 This is a really good streak \u2026 I want to congratulate you for completing all your sessions with Garden of Hope \u2026 Stay out of trouble, lead a law-abiding life for the next six months, and the record will be expunged \u2026 Good luck to you.On this morning, several cases were heard before a court officer finally called out: \u201c03585 dash 17. Yang Song!\u201dEven though she was five months dead, Song Yang still had an open criminal case: the arrest on a prostitution charge two months before her fatal fall. The sprawling New York City judicial system may seem overwhelmed, even chaotic, but in the end its books must be balanced. This meant that a formality known as an \u201cabatement by death\u201d \u2014 a dismissal, in effect \u2014 was required to close the short chapter on Song Yang, or Yang Song, as the system sometimes rendered her name.Judge Serita was informed that the deceased defendant\u2019s mother and brother were present and would like to thank the court. The request stilled the courtroom. The judge sighed in sympathy.\u201cThank you,\u201d she said. \u201cUm. All right. This case is now going to be abated by death.\u201dShe went on to tell Song Yang\u2019s mother and brother that everyone involved in the trafficking court was deeply saddened by their loved one\u2019s \u201ctragic and untimely death.\u201d She expressed hope that they \u201csomehow find peace with these unfortunate circumstances.\u201dMr. Song and Ms. Shi acknowledged her words with nods. They walked out of the courtroom, past an \u201cExit Only \u2014 No Re-Entry\u201d sign, and into the late-morning brightness. He lit a cigarette. She adjusted her backpack. They continued on in silence.Two weeks later, the mother and brother returned to Kew Gardens for a long-awaited meeting with investigators from the Homicide Investigations Bureau of the Queens district attorney\u2019s office. With everyone seated around a dark-wood conference table in a windowless room, the investigators shared the results of their monthslong inquiry, including 22 minutes of video culled from cameras positioned both inside and outside the building at 135-32 40th Road.In these images, their beloved daughter and sister appears in the fullness of life. Here is Song Yang, leading the undercover officer up the stairs. Here she is, kicking him out of the apartment, watching the officers ascend the stairs \u2014 rushing in alarm toward the balcony.Here, from street level, something falling, and then a beloved daughter and sister, crumpled on the pavement. Watching the video again a few days later, Ms. Shi noticed the headband that flies off her daughter\u2019s head.\u201cShe especially loved butterflies,\u201d the mother said.The video over, the investigators laid out their sober findings: The police involved in a bust-and-buy sting on 40th Road the night of Nov. 25, 2017, did not cause the death of Song Yang. To begin with, no officer was even in the fourth-floor apartment when she jumped or fell.Her brother scoffed at this conclusion. He said something rude in Mandarin. Meeting over.Night comes to 40th Road.The fruit and vegetable peddlers have boxed up and boarded up, and the last patrons of air-conditioned restaurants have stepped out to evaporate in the late June warmth. But the women are here, as always, calling out an invitation that sounds almost like a plea.They stand outside the same doorways, including the one for 135-32, where Song Yang once lingered. Very soon after she died, her fourth-floor apartment became the address for a new massage business. Its name: Heaven on Fourth.A few steps away, at the entrance to another of the gloomy buildings owned and operated by prominent Flushing businessmen, a thin woman in a brown dress sits in a metal chair with a square of Styrofoam for padding, studying her cellphone through the smoke of her cigarette. Then she pulls out a bag of overripe cherries from the building\u2019s broken mailbox and, between the repeated offerings of her services, spits out the pits and tosses them into the street, not far from a lamppost adorned with a poster bearing the face of Song Yang (\u201cBig Reward!\u201d).To the woman\u2019s right, roasted duck carcasses hang in the window of the Corner 28 restaurant, where a man is mop-swabbing the sticky floor. To her left, sorrowful creatures loll in a seafood restaurant\u2019s murky tank. Above her head, scaffolding provides protection from the stucco that city officials say has been coming loose from the buildings. Rain begins to fall.A nearby tanker truck groans as it sucks away a restaurant\u2019s used cooking oil through a large hose that snakes across the sidewalk and into the bowels of a building. The women adapt: They step over the hose, ignore the smell, raise their voices.One of the women leads a potential client to a building\u2019s threshold, but he keeps walking; she mutters an epithet in Mandarin. Then a buzz-cut junkie, who just hours before was asleep on the pavement, begins to harass the women, disrupting their business by hovering, touching, dropping his sweatpants and simulating sex acts. He enters one of their buildings and urinates in the hall.It is all ephemeral, of course, a realization reinforced daily by the laborers trudging down this street to the subway, bone-weary from working another of the construction projects that are redefining Flushing. Few today remember the Old Roma restaurant that once thrived on 40th Road, just as few tomorrow will remember a Chinese immigrant who once died on 40th Road.For now, at least, if you linger on the street, you will encounter those who remember her \u2014 including, occasionally, clients still looking for SiSi.You might see Lala, and Kiki, and Yoyo, along with other women who competed with Song Yang. You might see her lanky brother, Song Hai, who still struggles to understand why no one will be brought to justice for all that his sister went through in her adopted country. His grief smolders, as does his distrust of America.Lastly, you might see Song Yang\u2019s mother, Shi Yumei.One evening, Ms. Shi paused outside a building where some women were offering massages to passing men. Raising the drooping bags held in her hands, she explained that she had just left the food pantry at the Episcopal church on Main Street, where she had recently been baptized. She said the pastor had emphasized the importance of sharing what you have.The mother placed a bag of sweet potatoes in the doorway that had once been Song Yang\u2019s domain. It was an offering of sorts, a gift to women like her daughter. Then she was gone, assumed into the Flushing blur.Al Baker and Ashley Southall contributed reporting.

{"Headline": "Why Does Japan Make It So Hard for Working Women to Succeed?", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn MoneyTwo gray-haired men from Tokyo Medical University bowed their heads in shame before the assembled media in early August. An internal inquiry into one curious case \u2014 how did a government official\u2019s son gain admission despite doing poorly on the entrance exam? \u2014 had exposed a pattern of fraud and discrimination. For more than a decade, investigators found, the school had systematically altered entrance-exam scores to restrict the number of female students and to award admission to less-qualified male applicants. The supposed rationale, that female doctors are prone to leave the profession after marriage or childbirth, only inflamed a national debate on gender inequality. The school initially denied any knowledge of the wrongdoing, but one of the bowing men \u2014 Tetsuo Yukioka, who happened to be chairman of the school\u2019s diversity promotion panel \u2014 offered an oblique explanation: \u201cI suspect that there was a lack of sensitivity to the rules of modern society.\u201dA century and a half after opening up, Japan is now one of the planet\u2019s most advanced, affluent and democratic countries. But in one key respect, it has remained stubbornly regressive: Japanese women, to a degree that is striking even by the lamentable standards of the United States and much of the rest of the world, have been kept on the margins of business and politics. Five years ago, the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, vowed to create what he describes as \u201ca society where women can shine.\u201d Falling birthrates had left Japan with one of the world\u2019s oldest and fastest-shrinking labor forces. (The population from ages 15 to 64 is expected to plummet to 45 million in 2065 from 76 million in 2017.) Rather than open the gates to immigration, an unpopular solution in insular Japan, Abe embraced a plan to ease the way for millions of married and middle-aged women to return to work. The effort, Abe said, was \u201ca matter of the greatest urgency.\u201dThe nickname for Abe\u2019s program, \u201cwomenomics,\u201d originated with Kathy Matsui, the vice chairwoman of Goldman Sachs Japan. Matsui, a Japanese-American who has lived in Japan on and off for more than three decades, told me she became aware of women\u2019s underutilized economic potential soon after the birth of her first child during the stagnant 1990s. \u201cA lot of my \u2018mama\u2019 friends were not returning to the work force to the extent that I assumed,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI realized that maybe the growth solution for Japan was right in front of my face.\u201d After Abe adopted \u201cwomenomics\u201d in 2013, Matsui predicted that the plan could add 7.1 million employees and lift Japan\u2019s gross domestic product by nearly 13 percent. Activists and scholars were skeptical \u2014 the breathless calculations seemed to underplay the institutional sexism that pervades Japanese society \u2014 but Matsui credits Abe with depoliticizing the debate. \u201cHe moved the issue of diversity out of the realm of human rights into the realm of economic growth,\u201d Matsui says.Japan is not the only country that could benefit from tapping into women\u2019s latent economic power. The McKinsey Global Institute has calculated that in China, an increase in women\u2019s employment, hours and productivity could add 13 percent to its G.D.P. by 2025. The relative gains in India and Latin America could be even larger, because gender gaps are wider there. Over all, McKinsey estimates that a global drive toward gender equality \u2014 in work, government, society \u2014 could create $12 trillion in economic growth by 2025.Those fancy projections are tantalizing to investors \u2014 indeed, last month BNY Mellon started the Dreyfus Japan Womenomics Fund. But achieving them won\u2019t necessarily transform society. Abe\u2019s policy has succeeded in bringing more than one and a half million more Japanese women into the labor force over the past five years. The percentage of Japanese women who work, in fact, has surpassed the levels in the United States and is helping offset a steady decline in male workers. Yet most of the work is part time and relatively low paid. These jobs help the economy, but they do little to advance careers or bridge Japan\u2019s gender wage gap, which, at 24.5 percent, is third-worst among developed countries. (In the United States, the gap is 18.2 percent.) \u201cWomenomics was never aimed at women\u2019s well-being,\u201d says Kaori Katada, an associate professor in social policy at Tokyo\u2019s Hosei University. \u201cIt targets economic growth only. For that purpose, it intends to fully \u2018utilize\u2019 women and consume them as human capital.\u201dJapan has only sunk further in the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Gender Gap Index, falling last year to 114 out of 144 countries, where it is wedged between Guinea and Ethiopia. The ranking reflects the continuing dearth of female leaders in business and politics. A 2017 Japanese government report found that women make up just 13 percent of managerial positions in Japan, compared with 44 percent in the United States. According to a recent Reuters poll, three-quarters of Japanese companies say they have no female senior executives. A 2015 law now requires larger companies to set targets for hiring and promoting women and to report on the results, but there are no penalties for inaction.Politics is even more of a male bastion. With women accounting for just 10 percent of the members in Japan\u2019s lower house, the country ranks 161st out of 193 countries in female political representation, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union. (Saudi Arabia ranks 60 places higher, two spots ahead of the United States.) A new nonbinding law urges political parties to do \u201cas much as possible\u201d to field more female candidates and to strive for gender equality. But again, the law has no teeth, and Abe isn\u2019t exactly helping. After his re-election as party leader in September, he formed a new 19-member cabinet with just one woman. Asked how this jibes with womenomics, Abe tried to brush it off, saying his female appointee had the \u201cpresence of two or three women.\u201dJapan\u2019s narrow-gauged success in getting women into the work force masks a deeper failure to uproot or even to challenge a discriminatory culture that makes it nearly impossible for women to advance a career while raising a family. Japanese women are still expected to do the vast majority of unpaid labor. How can they also keep up with the punishingly long hours and bonding over evening drinks that companies often require of their employees? Abe\u2019s government has taken many helpful steps: approving more day-care centers (though nearly 20,000 toddlers are still on waiting lists), passing a law limiting overtime to 100 hours a month, expanding parental leave for women and men alike (though barely 5 percent of new fathers take any leave at all). Ingrained attitudes and policies change slowly. Earlier this year, for example, a Japanese day care worker was forced to apologize to colleagues for becoming pregnant out of turn. Her company\u2019s director had apparently dictated that a more senior worker be allowed to get pregnant first.Last month, Ogata ran into trouble again with her male colleagues in Kumamoto. As she was speaking to the assembly, another lawmaker demanded to know what she had in her mouth. A cough drop for my sore throat, she said. The men stopped the session and scoured their rule books for lozenge-eating infractions. After hours of bickering, Ogata was thrown out for refusing to apologize.

{"Headline": "Google Retreats from Berlin Plan Opposed by Local Groups", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 What Google wants, Google usually gets, but in Berlin\u2019s Kreuzberg neighborhood, residents have won a battle against the internet giant, which backed away from a project in the face of local opposition.Google had planned to convert an old electric company building in Kreuzberg into an incubator for tech start-ups, the kind of development that could have altered the fabric of the funky, multicultural area.Instead, the company announced on Wednesday that after sinking millions of dollars into the project, it will make the space available, free of charge, to nonprofit social service and local advocacy groups \u2014 a move its adversaries welcomed.The decision handed a surprise victory to anti-gentrification groups who had protested Google\u2019s plan, but some city officials saw it as a lost economic opportunity and a stain on Berlin\u2019s vaunted tech-friendly reputation.Kreuzberg has long been one of the most affordable areas of Berlin, making it a haven for students, immigrants, artists and activists, a hub of culture, night life and left-wing politics. But in a pattern repeated in similar neighborhoods in many of the world\u2019s wealthiest cities, affluent people have moved in, too, in recent years, bringing with them the social tensions of gentrification.\u201cThey push out the people who were here before,\u201d said Achim Koppitsch, 60, who runs a vinyl record store in Kreuzberg. \u201cYou can\u2019t find any more cool places \u2014 instead you get hipster cafes that roast their own beans.\u201dResidents opposed to the Kreuzberg project worried about tech salaries driving up rents in a neighborhood already dotted with new restaurants that local residents cannot afford. But reasons for the opposition went beyond gentrification: Some people were opposed to Google because of its data collection and tax avoidance practices.\u201cBecause it was Google, it was always bigger than just an anti-gentrification fight,\u201d said Konstantin Sergiou, a neighborhood activist who worked against the project. \u201cWe were lucky.\u201dLocal resistance to such projects is fairly common. Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, has faced opposition in Toronto, where it plans to redevelop a section of waterfront, and a Google plan to overhaul an area of San Jose, Calif., has faced criticism.But cities often see the gentrification that comes with an influx of tech workers as a good problem to have, and they compete with one another to attract big companies. Amazon\u2019s plans to open a second headquarters drew more than 200 bids.In Berlin\u2019s city government, opinion is split.Sebastian Czaja, the head of the pro-business Federal Democrats faction in Berlin\u2019s House of Representatives, said that Google\u2019s retreat will discourage other companies from settling in the city, which bills itself as the start-up capital of Europe.\u201cEven if the new use of the venue is welcome, the message to all future companies and investors is fatal: Do not come to Berlin, certainly not to Kreuzberg,\u201d he said in a statement.Progressive politicians lauded Google for its decision to focus on social services, charities and neighborhood groups.\u201cThere is a lot of potential for solving societal challenges,\u201d said Ramona Pop of the Greens, the city senator responsible for the economy, in a statement praising Google\u2019s announcement.Mr. Koppitsch\u2019s record store, across the street from the Google site, is typical of the old Kreuzberg, an informal community center where people come to chat and browse through the 10,000 discs.\u201cI think it\u2019s a very positive turn of events, and doing something social is much in tune with what Kreuzberg is about,\u201d he said.Ulrike Ebeling, 46, of GIZ, a corporation that works with the government in international aid and development, says she sees herself as a recently arrived gentrifier. Doing her wash in a Kreuzberg laundromat, she said she understood the local groups\u2019 arguments, but was not sure Google\u2019s withdrawal was good for the city.\u201cI think it would be good for a capital to have some big employers, not just the big stodgy government as an employer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut does it have to be in Kreuzberg? I don\u2019t know.\u201dGoogle, which first announced plans in late 2016 to open a 32,000-square-foot start-up campus, said this week that it had taken note of the protests, but took pains to counter the idea that it had been pressured into changing its plans. An incubator specifically for start-ups was no longer as needed as it was two years ago, the company said.\u201cFrom the beginning, our goal with the campus was not only to create a space for start-ups, but also to open the space up to social organizations,\u201d Rowan Barnett, the head of Google for start-ups in Germany, said in a statement.\u201cBut to do it, you need friends like Google on your side,\u201d he said.Adam Satariano contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Mayor at 19, New York Governor at 43? Molinaro Seeks an Upset Over Cuomo.", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "Marcus Molinaro, the Republican candidate who finds himself unable to narrow a deficit in the polls, says his life\u2019s struggles have helped define his campaign.Supported byTIVOLI, N.Y. \u2014 For the sake of historical perspective, let the record show that Marcus J. Molinaro did not initially want to run for governor.A narrow path to victory seemed possible. Mr. Cuomo could be vulnerable on issues like the spotty upstate economy, New York City\u2019s decrepit subway system, and corruption. And on paper, Mr. Molinaro was considered a potentially potent foe: young, energetic and accomplished, having once been elected the youngest mayor in the country in Tivoli, the Hudson Valley village where he came of age.So far, however, it has not exactly worked out.Just days before the election, Mr. Molinaro finds himself unable to narrow a yawning deficit in the polls, and struggling to raise money and awareness of his candidacy. He is stumping, but often for seemingly meager rewards, sometimes drawing little more than curiosity seekers to campaign events.Yet for all of that, Mr. Molinaro, a boyish 43-year-old with a wisp of gray at the temples, insists he is still eager for the fight.\u201cI want to win,\u201d he said during a recent stop in Rochester. \u201cI want to change the dialogue, change policy and win.\u201dMr. Molinaro is quick to laugh \u2014 a big, sometimes nearly nervous guffaw \u2014 when describing his life. But when he speaks about Mr. Cuomo, he does so with a disdain that seems to be borne as much out of his feelings about the governor\u2019s personality as his politics.\u201cI think he thinks money and power define success,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said. \u201cI think he thinks to be successful, one needs to be a bully. And I think that he thinks that the only way to be successful is to show off his toughness.\u201dIt is hard not to feel that some of this animus comes from a class difference in the upbringings of each man. In the Republican\u2019s view, the race pits Mr. Cuomo, the well-to-do, big-city scion of a political dynasty, against Mr. Molinaro, the lower-class son of divorced parents who grew up in this small village where he was elected mayor at the age of 19.And to listen to Mr. Molinaro is to be constantly reminded of that of that disparity.\u201cI\u2019ve always had that feeling that I\u2019m on the outside. I just have,\u201d he said. \u201cI know a lot of people who feel that way. But when I\u2019m in a room with exceptionally wealthy people, I feel like I\u2019m the poor kid.\u201dHis family\u2019s financial struggles are one of two events that appear to define Mr. Molinaro\u2019s personal and campaign narratives. In some ways, his political philosophy seems to stem from an instance when he was a child: His mother was forced to use food stamps and was confronted by a disrespectful clerk at the Dutchess County Department of Community and Family Services, an agency he now controls.\u201cShe must have had a bad day and made my mother feel small, and made her feel so worthless,\u201d Mr. Molinaro recalled. \u201cI don\u2019t blame that woman, but I saw at that moment what a person with a degree of power could have. So entering into elective office, my goal was to empower people to do for themselves and government to be active, to be engaged but not to be intrusive.\u201dHe has also been outspoken on mental health issues.This, too, seems informed by his biography. After the loss of a young child in 1970s, Mr. Molinaro\u2019s mother suffered from depression. She and her husband divorced when Mr. Molinaro was in elementary school.\u201cI can remember as a kid the arguments,\u201d he said. \u201cI can still remember being in a bunk bed on the lower bunk, my brother on the upper bunk, and my parents arguing and my father leaving.\u201dHis parents\u2019 breakup caused Mr. Molinaro to \u201cgrow up very quickly,\u201d he said, dealing with family business like the power and cable bills. His life settled after his mother remarried and moved to Tivoli, where Mr. Molinaro soon flourished as a precocious, if quiet, standout in government classes.Steve Sutton, his social studies teacher at Red Hook High School, said Mr. Molinaro restarted a student council while he was a teenager.\u201cWe probably should have seen something coming at that point,\u201d said Mr. Sutton, adding that he thought Mr. Molinaro\u2019s goal \u201cwas about serving,\u201d not governing. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to sound like a campaign ad. But he really wanted to make the school better.\u201dDuring high school, Mr. Molinaro took an internship with a Democratic assemblywoman, Eileen Hickey. Shortly thereafter, he had his first encounter with the Cuomo family, meeting then-Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in the State Capitol.\u201cHe said he\u2019d carve out three minutes, and three minutes became 15 minutes,\u201d Mr. Molinaro recalled. \u201cHe talked to us, he asked us questions and he was kind.\u201dMr. Molinaro, who initially registered as a Democrat, seems to defer from making blanket partisan statements; he openly praises such Democratic Party legends as Harry S. Truman, Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Robert F. Kennedy, and sometimes appears almost reluctant to align with the broader Republican Party.\u201cThere\u2019s a national party and they have a perspective, and then there\u2019s what we do at the local level,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want that to sound as dismissive. I just don\u2019t see the world based on some broad label.\u201dHe added that his job at a county level has more to do with delivering services than political dogma. \u201cI haven\u2019t met the harshness, I haven\u2019t seen the anger where I serve,\u201d he said.But Mr. Cuomo and his surrogates have pounded Mr. Molinaro with a campaign catchphrase, dubbing him as a \u201cTrump mini-me,\u201d and have described him as part of a \u201cextreme conservative\u201d movement posing ample social and financial threats to the state.Mr. Molinaro admitted he does not have a passion for fund-raising, calling it \u201cunseemly.\u201dAssemblyman Daniel J. O\u2019Donnell, a Manhattan Democrat, remembers Mr. Molinaro as an affable colleague.\u201cHe toed the party line, but did I feel he was a zealot? No,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Donnell, who is openly gay, said. \u201cThe ones that really hate gay marriage, they don\u2019t ask about your husband every time.\u201dIn 2011, Mr. Molinaro successfully ran for Dutchess County executive, and he was easily re-elected in 2015. Neither victory gathered the attention or curiosity of his election as the teenage mayor of Tivoli, which led to appearances on the \u201cToday\u201d show and the \u201cPhil Donahue Show.\u201dMr. Molinaro has recounted the story of that election dozens of times \u2014 \u201cI tell the joke, I ran home and asked my mom if it would be O.K. if I ran for mayor\u201d \u2014 and he still lives near Tivoli.For all of that invective, Mr. Molinaro said he remains proud of the race he has run, describing it as a chance for someone from his world to engage with he called \u201cthe power and grandeur and romance\u201d that political world can sometimes contain.\u201cListen, there\u2019s only one time that a poor kid gets to run for governor in the State of New York,\u201d Mr. Molinaro said. \u201cHow many times does a guy like me get an opportunity to do this?\u201dAdvertisement"}

New, lighter and more fuel efficient, dual-engine aircraft \u2014 including the Airbus models and Boeing\u2019s Dreamliner \u2014 make flying for nearly a day economically viable as the number of ultra-long-haul flights increases.Business-class fliers on Singapore Airlines from Newark can still get dishes by its partner chef, Alfred Portale, of Gotham Bar and Grill, but with its new Newark-Singapore route, the airline is introducing meal options created by the spa Canyon Ranch. Available in both classes of service, the dishes might include prawn ceviche (170 calories), seared organic chicken and zucchini noodles (370 calories) and lemon angel food cake (140 calories).Working with researchers from the University of Sydney\u2019s Charles Perkins Center, Qantas offers lemon and ginger kombucha, wake-up shots of probiotic-infused juice and sleep-inducing tea in its top two classes. In addition, meals are delayed upon take off to align closer to meal times at the destination to help travelers adjust to time-zone changes.And then there\u2019s food on demand. Rather than requiring passengers to climb over sleeping neighbors to reach the galley for a Coke mid-flight (not necessarily bad, from a movement perspective), Air New Zealand will allow passengers on its newest super long-haul flight to order snacks via the touch-screen entertainment system.When it launched its Perth-London route earlier this year, Qantas created a new transit lounge at the Perth airport for business class travelers featuring stretching and breathing classes offered every 15 minutes, bathrooms with light therapy in the shower suites designed to help travelers adjust to time changes, and a hydration station with fruit-infused water and herbal tea. An open-air terrace is open to fliers in all classes of travel.Earlier this year, Cathay Pacific joined with the international yoga studio Pure Yoga to launch a new in-flight wellness program called Travel Well with Yoga. Six videos feature yoga and meditation exercises to improve circulation, mobility and relaxation.Singapore Airlines\u2019 partnership with Canyon Ranch extends to guided stretching exercises demonstrated by the spa\u2019s exercise physiologists in videos on the seat back entertainment systems.

Its new exploratory program called Project Sunrise has challenged aircraft makers to design planes that could fly more than 20 hours between Sydney and London or New York by 2022. The airline is exploring how it can convert space not suited to seats into bars, stretching zones and work and study areas.In part the efforts are motivated by Australia\u2019s remote locale relative to other major airports. \u201cWe\u2019re not a hub carrier, we\u2019re an end-of-line carrier,\u201d said Phil Capps, the head of customer experience at Qantas. \u201cWe have to take the customer more seriously than other carriers might in global hubs.\u201dThe most exciting onboard amenities that have been proposed, such as gyms, tend to be restricted to business and first-class fliers, and most analysts think such offerings, if they can\u2019t be monetized, won\u2019t fly.

{"Headline": "Brazil Election: Jair Bolsonaro Heads to Runoff After Missing Outright Win", "Date": "2018-10-07", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 A far-right candidate who has spoken fondly of Brazil\u2019s onetime military dictatorship came close to an outright victory in the country\u2019s presidential election on Sunday, as Brazilians expressed disgust with politics as usual and endorsed an iron-fisted approach to fighting crime and corruption.Voters delivered a first-round victory to Jair Bolsonaro, who had stunned the political establishment by rising to the top of a crowded presidential field despite a long history of offensive remarks about women, blacks and gays.With 99.9 percent of votes tallied, Mr. Bolsonaro had 46 percent of the vote; he needed 50 percent to avoid a runoff. His nearest rival finished far behind, with 29 percent.With the presidency in sight, Mr. Bolsonaro said Sunday night he intended to unite a nation that is \u201con the brink of chaos\u201d and said, \u201cTogether we will rebuild our Brazil.\u201dBrazilians will now vote in the runoff election on Oct. 28 between Mr. Bolsonaro and Fernando Haddad, the leftist Workers\u2019 Party candidate. The two men represent radically different visions for Brazil, the world\u2019s fourth-largest democracy, where leftists have won the presidency in every election since 2002.However strongly Mr. Bolsonaro performed on Sunday, he remains an extremely divisive figure who alienated large segments of Brazil\u2019s highly diverse population during the campaign.But political analysts said Sunday night that Mr. Haddad faces a daunting task in the second round to rally a majority of Brazilians to his side.Laura Carvalho, an economist at University of S\u00e3o Paulo, said the best bet for the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s candidate would be to focus on pocketbook issues over the next three weeks. \u201cInstead of focusing on racism and misogyny, which did not have much effect, they should focus on the economic agenda and the anti-worker aspect of the Bolsonaro candidacy,\u201d Ms. Carvalho said.While several of Brazil\u2019s neighbors have steered to the right politically in recent years, a victory by Mr. Bolsonaro, a populist conservative who stands to join a growing roster of anti-establishment leaders around the world, would be a seismic conservative shift.Critics of Mr. Bolsonaro and political analysts have watched his rise with alarm, fearing he could become an authoritarian leader in the mold of Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey and Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines.Rejected by mainstream parties, Mr. Bolsonaro struggled to find a running mate until early August, when he picked a recently retired general who has advocated military intervention as a means to purge a corrupt ruling elite. He has said he intends to appoint other military leaders to central roles.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s first-round victory was all the more remarkable because he lacked the backing of a major party and campaigned on a shoestring budget, relying mainly on social media to build a base. As of mid-September, the Bolsonaro campaign reported having spent about $235,000, a small fraction of the $6.3 million the Haddad campaign disclosed having spent.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s rise was enabled by the political divisions that have torn the country apart in recent years.Brazilians were outraged as leaders of the traditional parties become ensnared in an ever-widening corruption investigation that began in 2014 and became ever more despondent as the economy sputtered, joblessness grew and crime soared.While some voters remained loyal to the Workers\u2019 Party \u2014 which governed from 2003 to 2016 \u2014 for its efforts to improve the lives of poor and working-class Brazilians, many came to hold it responsible for the graft and economic hardship of recent years.Georgewlany Smith, a 61-year-old public servant in Rio de Janeiro, said that an erosion of democratic norms and civil liberties is a price he is willing to pay for a more secure and prosperous Brazil.\u201cYou have to consider what were the best times for Brazil,\u201d Mr. Smith said shortly after he voted for Mr. Bolsonaro in the upscale Barra de Tijuca district. \u201cUnfortunately it was the dictatorship.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro has tapped into the simmering anger and desire for disruption of the status quo that has gripped many Brazilians. And he became the face of a growing conservative movement in a nation where evangelicals account for one in four voters and more than 90 federal lawmakers.The candidate offered little in the way of a detailed policy road map \u2014 particularly regarding the country\u2019s floundering economy. When pressed with questions, he offered up Paulo Guedes, a market-friendly economist he said he would appoint as finance minister to curtail the social spending that grew under the Workers\u2019 Party.The markets rallied as he took the lead in polls \u2014 but Mr. Bolsonaro is \u201cnot the pro-market liberal he pretends to be,\u201d warned Monica de Bolle, a Brazilian economist who heads the Latin American Studies Program at Johns Hopkins University.\u201cHe really stands out for having overly simplistic solutions to very complex problems, a characteristic that will certainly backfire,\u201d she said.Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s victory will most likely be denounced by many on the left as the undemocratic outcome of an election that excluded the towering politician in recent Brazilian history: former President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, a rousing former steelworker and union leader who rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s opposing the military dictatorship.Mr. da Silva, who served two terms and left office in 2011 with a record-high approval rating, was the front-runner for much of the past year and appeared well positioned to return to the presidential palace. But he became ineligible to run for office after an appeals court early this year upheld a corruption and money laundering conviction against him.Mr. Haddad, 55, who comes across as an earnest intellectual and lacks Mr. da Silva\u2019s fiery charisma, was unknown in much of the country and failed to galvanize core Workers\u2019 Party voters who had identified with Mr. da Silva\u2019s working-class roots and life story.Some voters remain fiercely loyal to Mr. da Silva, though.Anita Silva Lima, a 38-year-old waitress who lives in Rocinha, a low-income neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro, said on Sunday morning that she and her seven immediate relatives had voted for \u201cLula\u2019s candidate,\u201d resisting pressure from her boss, who urged her to back Mr. Bolsonaro.\u201cI don\u2019t want a dictatorship \u2014 a lot of people died then,\u201d said Ms. Lima, who is originally from the impoverished northeast, a Workers\u2019 Party stronghold. \u201cI don\u2019t care about this corruption talk. Tell me the name of a politician who doesn\u2019t steal? Bolsonaro steals, too.\u201dOthers have lost faith in the Workers\u2019 Party and feel the current race leaves them with no good options.\u201cThey are all the same,\u201d said Carlos Alberto da Silva, a 59-year-old driver in Rio de Janeiro who supported the Workers\u2019 Party in 2014 and said he intended to signal his frustration by spoiling his ballot this year.Among the striking surprises of Sunday\u2019s election was the defeat of former President Dilma Rousseff of the Workers\u2019 Party, who was running for the Senate. Public opinion polls had suggested she would easily win a seat in her home state of Minas Gerais, but Ms. Rousseff came in fourth.Clara Ara\u00fajo, a sociologist at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said voters showed a strong disdain for the dominant political factions on Sunday.\u201cThe dissatisfaction over the economic crisis, it seems to me, was channeled along with a discourse about conservative morals,\u201d she said. Those who voted for Mr. Bolsonaro, she said, saw him as \u201cthe option for a certain order, a certain stability, even if this notion was based on easy ways out.\u201dMr. Bolsonaro warned voters that returning the Workers\u2019 Party to power would perpetuate a culture of graft that has been exposed in recent years and has tainted every large political party and several of the country\u2019s top companies.He also contended that under leftist rule, Brazil risked stumbling into an economic crisis like the one that has sparked a mass exodus in neighboring Venezuela.As most of his dozen rivals traveled around the country and participated in debates, Mr. Bolsonaro largely sat out the final month of the race recovering in a hospital in S\u00e3o Paulo and later at his home in Rio de Janeiro.In recent days he has recorded daily videos broadcast live on Facebook weighing in on the news of the day. The unscripted, shaky clips were illustrative of a campaign that had an insurgent, improvisational feel from the start.As a Bolsonaro victory appeared increasingly likely, ardent opponents protested online and in the streets under the motto: #EleN\u00e3o, or Not Him, warning that the country\u2019s democratic institutions could be eroded.But influential evangelical and agribusiness lobbies rallied to his side in the final stretch, while investors and wealthy Brazilians backed him, believing that Mr. Bolsonaro would curtail social spending and implement market-friendly reforms.Outside Mr. Bolsonaro\u2019s beachfront apartment in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday night, supporters sang the national anthem and chanted \u201cthe captain has arrived\u201d as the first results showed him winning by a large margin.\u201cGetting rid of the P.T. alone is not a solution, but it\u2019s a first step toward fixing the country,\u201d said Barbara Laureano, a 25-year-old business woman, referring to the Workers\u2019 Party. \u201cThis is not about him as a person, it\u2019s about an idea,\u201d she said.Lis Moriconi contributed reporting.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Hurricane Michael Leaves Trail of Destruction as It Slams Florida\u2019s Panhandle", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPANAMA CITY, Fla. \u2014 Hurricane Michael, one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the continental United States, slammed into the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday, unleashing a trail of destruction across 200 miles that splintered houses, peeled off roofs and stirred up a terrifying surge of seawater that submerged entire neighborhoods and sent boats careening down city streets.A storm that was initially forecast to arrive as a tropical storm instead amped up to furious intensity, hitting landfall just after midday near the small seaside community of Mexico Beach, 100 miles southwest of Tallahassee, with winds topping 155 miles per hour.Images from there showed swaths of shattered debris where houses once stood and structures inundated up to their rooftops; the streets of Panama City, farther west, were blocked by downed tree limbs and impossible tangles of power lines. Recreational vehicles, trucks and even trains were pushed over, surrounded by new lakes of water.\u201cHurricane Michael is the worst storm that the Florida Panhandle has ever seen,\u201d said Gov. Rick Scott of Florida, where 375,000 people were ordered evacuated from the western part of the state.The storm was officially classified as a Category 4 \u2014 on the verge of Category 5 \u2014 but weakened as it continued its rapid advance up toward Georgia and the Carolinas, where cities still reeling from Hurricane Florence prepared for another onslaught of rain and wind. It was downgraded to a tropical storm at midnight on Wednesday.Just about every update seemed to bring greater grimness: closed bridges, more towering waves, suspended emergency services, admonitions that the time to evacuate had passed. The National Hurricane Center reported a 130-mile-per-hour wind gust near the evacuated Tyndall Air Force Base \u2014 and said that the measuring instrument had then failed.At least two people were killed, and the authorities feared they would find more bodies in the rubble as specialized out-of-town teams, local officials and residents hurriedly searched for trapped survivors and assessed the damage.Residents and emergency workers spent most of the day hunkered down, and emerged only toward nightfall to begin assessing the storm\u2019s toll. As dusk approached, though, the early outlines of a vast calamity were unfolding.\u201cYou can\u2019t drive a car anywhere, you can\u2019t do anything because it\u2019s littered with houses, pieces of houses,\u201d said Patricia Mulligan, who rode out the storm with her family in a condo in Mexico Beach, a town of mom-and-pop shops and sport-fishing businesses about 35 miles southeast of Panama City. Outside, she said in a phone interview, she could see remnants of people\u2019s lives strewn about: refrigerators, a beanbag chair, a washing machine, a kayak and a dresser.Her brother, she said, lost a condo along the beach, and the other nearby units were also destroyed. \u201cThey\u2019re not there,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s gone.\u201dThe ominous, unmistakable rhythm of a hurricane\u2019s rains \u2014 drizzle, followed by unhinged gushing, and then drizzle again \u2014 unnerved the coast on Wednesday morning hours before the fullest ravages began. And then the force of the hurricane tore through, cracking walls, toppling heavy metal fences and flattening cars with lampposts while people, unable or unwilling to evacuate, huddled in closets and stairwells. Entire counties seemed to rumble with the sounds of screeching winds that pushed rain sideways across streets. Lights flickered, and then they went dark.A stronger hurricane had not hit the Panhandle in 167 years of record-keeping.But the perils were farther reaching, with emergency declarations in effect for 322 counties across five Southern states. Warnings and watches \u2014 whether for hurricanes, tropical storms, storm surge or some brutish combination \u2014 were issued for as far west as Alabama\u2019s border with Mississippi, and for the coasts of Georgia and the Carolinas.The storm is not expected to move offshore until Friday, having swept over much of Georgia as a hurricane and then North and South Carolina as a tropical storm.Florida\u2019s government said nearly 6,700 people were in 54 shelters and that close to 30,000 customers lost electricity before the storm\u2019s landfall. A series of transformer explosions and other mishaps knocked out power to 388,000 homes and businesses, the governor\u2019s office reported. The National Guard activated 3,500 troops, and the authorities said 1.5 million meals were ready to be distributed. Some one million gallons of water were also prepared.\u201cUnfortunately, this is a Gulf Coast hurricane of the worst kind because all of the elements associated with hurricanes come into play,\u201d Brock Long, the chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, said Wednesday after he briefed President Trump in the Oval Office.Mr. Trump, who is expected to visit the region as early as Sunday, said he would be \u201ctotally focused\u201d on the storm but would not cancel a Wednesday night campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\u201cAll of America sends its unwavering love and support,\u201d he said at the rally. \u201cWe will spare no effort, no expense, no resource to help these great fellow citizens of ours who are going through a tough time right now.\u201dClearly, the worst of the devastation is likely to be in the Panhandle, a region known more for its beaches, seaside towns and oyster harvests than as a target of a tropical cyclone.The area has two nicknames: To the west, it is the Emerald Coast, named for the blue-green waters of the Gulf; to the east, it is the Forgotten Coast, intended to evoke the peaceful quiet of rural beaches. As the state\u2019s economy has broadly flourished, parts of the Panhandle, once dependent on paper mills and the lumber industry, have struggled.The storm came with tragic speed and unanticipated power after surfacing in the Western Caribbean as \u201cpotential tropical cyclone 14\u201d on Saturday, 55 days before the end of the Atlantic hurricane season. Forecasters immediately predicted that the system would strike the Panhandle, probably on Wednesday afternoon as a tropical storm.But as the cyclone approached and met the Gulf of Mexico, it grew more harrowing.On Monday morning, the storm had winds of 70 miles per hour, under the threshold of a hurricane. On Tuesday morning, wind speeds reached 110 miles per hour, and at nightfall, forecasters believed they would go no higher than 129 miles per hour.But the storm intensified far more than unexpected overnight, and by sunrise on Wednesday, the winds had reached 140 miles per hour. Later they were even higher, reaching 155 miles per hour \u2014 just two miles per hour short of Category 5 strength \u2014 by landfall.\u201cThe shear was high, so nobody expected it was going to intensify this rapidly,\u201d said Haiyan Jiang, an associate professor at Florida International University who studies tropical cyclones.The storm was the first major hurricane \u2014 a storm with winds of at least 111 miles per hour \u2014 to make landfall in the continental United States since Hurricane Irma last year. That storm, which struck a different part of Florida, caused an estimated $50 billion in damage and was cited in 92 deaths.The storm\u2019s rapid intensification gave emergency officials and residents little time to prepare.\u201cWhen they started a couple of days ago and said it was going to be a Category 1, it was, like, \u2018Cat 1, no big deal,\u2019\u201d Laurie Hamm said at the Panama City hotel where she had taken refuge a few miles from her townhouse nearer the beach. \u201cWhen they said Cat 2, it was like, \u2018Oh, maybe we\u2019d better pay attention.\u2019 And when they said Cat 3, it was like, \u2018Oh, Lord.\u2019\u201dThe rains had already started pounding on Wednesday morning when people lined up in Lincoln High School in Tallahassee to seek shelter. They carried grocery bags filled with snacks, bedding and the occasional pet.Already, the room was busy with people trying to make the best of the storm that had driven them out of their homes in fear. They had watched how Hurricane Florence ravaged the Carolinas less than a month ago.Betty Clark and Betty Tyler, friends who live in the same neighborhood of trailer homes, shared a table in front of a television as Ms. Tyler\u2019s grandchildren flitted around the room.\u201cI\u2019d rather be safe than foolish,\u201d said Ms. Tyler, 73, who moved into the shelter on Tuesday night. By Wednesday morning, she laughed: \u201cI was ready to go home.\u201dShe was not sure when that would be.Near the center of the room, Marco Sanchez and Lesley Padilla rested on three inflatable mattresses they bought Tuesday night at Walmart, after concluding that their trailer home might be unsafe for four young children.\u201cWe left all our possessions and brought the most important ones: our papers and our children\u2019s papers,\u201d Mr. Sanchez said.Their 2-month-old daughter, Meghan Sanchez, dozed in a baby carrier as her siblings, ranging from 3 to 11 years old, played games on tablets.\u201cThe important thing is we\u2019re all safe here,\u201d Mr. Sanchez said. \u201cUntil the storm has passed.\u201dRichard Fausset reported from Panama City, Alan Blinder from Atlanta and Patricia Mazzei from Tallahassee, Fla.

{"Headline": "Who Knew? These Countries Are All Oil Producers", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome oil-producing countries are well known: The three top crude suppliers, of course, are Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States. But almost 100 countries have tapped the oil reserves within their territories to produce a few barrels every day \u2014 the bottom-ranking, Slovenia, ekes out just five, according to the United States Energy Information Administration\u2019s figures for 2016. We looked at eight other intriguing, lesser known oil producers, listing their ranking and barrel production per day.89th, 1,000 barrels dailyThere was evidence of onshore oil in this tiny, 166-square-mile island dating to colonial times, though in the 18th century, extraction consisted mostly of digging pits by hand and grubbing around to find the puddles of crude that resulted. The first machine-drilled well arrived in the 1890s, as part of the West Indies Petroleum Company, and soon the number had swelled to 240 extraction wells drilled to a depth of 2,000 to 6,000 feet. Most exploration of the Bajan oil reserves now centers on the village of Woodbourne, in St. Philip parish, close to the international airport, though production is declining. In response, the government has plans to reboot some of the dormant wells using carbon dioxide technology, although it must also battle with the looming challenge of closure of the Petrotrin refinery in nearby Trinidad, where all Bajan crude has been processed.57th, 35,574 barrels dailyThe New Zealand oil industry is a minor part of the nation\u2019s economy: The $2.5 billion (New Zealand dollars) it contributes each year is just 1 percent of the overall gross national product. It was still an issue, though, when Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced caps on new energy licenses after taking office in October 2017. Opposition was centered near Taranaki, where exploration is concentrated. Nonetheless, Ms. Ardern was carrying through on campaign promises. Her goal is to reduce the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. Various initiatives support that aim, from a plan to plant 100 million trees, to the cap on new oil-drilling permits (there are 31 currently active, all but four of which are in production). Ms. Ardern\u2019s proposal would effectively eradicate the industry when the last such license expires, in 2030, though her government has said case-by-case consideration remains possible.69th, 18,087 barrels dailyThe Netherlands is synonymous with the business of oil, thanks to companies like Royal Dutch Shell, the sixth-largest corporation in the world. But it also has a history of production, mostly centered on Drenthe, where van Gogh lived and worked in a different kind of oil. It was the Shell forerunner BPM that undertook oil exploration here in the 1930s, before production began in the following decade. It lasted until 1996, when the high cost of extraction effectively terminated the onshore facilities. You can still see derelict pumps dotting the landscape. Recent technological advances, especially pumping steam into the oil in the substrate to make it more fluid and easier to extract, kick-started the homegrown oil industry.51st, 50,000 barrels dailyThe British-New Zealand geologist Maj. Frank Holmes was known as Abu Naft or Father of Oil in Bahrain, after securing the first oil concession there in the 1920s. He found oil soon after. Until then, the island nation in the Middle East had been widely known for pearl diving, but it would become the first oil producer in the gulf. The Sunni-run kingdom has both onshore and offshore reserves \u2014 in a field shared with Saudi Arabia \u2014 but has long been a small producer, refusing to join the OPEC cartel. Bahrain\u2019s slumbering industry was jolted back to life this spring, when a vast new shale reserve was discovered off its west coast. It is being assessed to see how much of the oil can successfully be reached via fracking; experts assume it will eventually produce at least 80 billion barrels and so drive the island to a higher rank in the global production table.82nd, 3,172 barrels dailyGreece is the world\u2019s third-largest producer of oil \u2014 olive, that is, with 350,000 tons annually. That\u2019s one-and-a -half times as much as the crude it pumps out of its fields; even that production does not come close to covering domestic demand, forcing the government to import 60 percent of its needs from Russia. This could change, however, if initial exploration reports pan out. Some scoffed when former Prime Minister Antonis Samaras pinned hopes of an economic recovery on crude during Greece\u2019s darkest days of austerity, claiming that the country had ample untapped reserves. Mr. Samaras can scoff now: Recent exploration suggests that there are at least three billion barrels of oil under the Ionian Sea and around the island of Crete. Hydrocarbons have been confirmed in the seabed of the eastern Mediterranean, off the coasts of Egypt, Cyprus and Israel, and the geological similarities with the waters off Greece are promising.34th, 257,525 barrels dailyOil production here is relatively recent, dating to the 1980s, though the nation imports more than half its daily consumption. Most of the country\u2019s oil comes from fields dotting the Gulf of Thailand \u2014 the largest by far is the Chevron-operated Benjamas in the north Pattani Trough. The state-owned oil company, PTT, is also a major force in domestic and international energy, and is the only Thai company on the Fortune Global 500.27th, 510,650 barrels dailyVenezuela may be South America\u2019s headline-grabbing producer, but there\u2019s stealth competition from an unlikely source: Argentina, which has the fourth-largest shale oil reserves in the world. If its president, the entrepreneurial Mauricio Macri, follows through on his plans for the energy sector, oil could lift the country from its economic doldrums. Mr. Macri has adopted more business-friendly rules, including reducing operating costs by minimizing the power of unions, and has championed public-private partnerships to operate in competition with Argentina\u2019s state-owned oil company YPF, which has long effectively held a monopoly. Mr. Macri says he believes that the path to exploiting Argentina\u2019s overlooked oil reserves is via public-private partnerships. So, later this year, Shell, Equinor (formerly Statoil) and other major companies will bid on new offshore exploration rights.71st, 16,418 barrels dailyA rusty truck and a few old pumps mark out the French Oil Museum in Merkwiller-Pechelbronn. It\u2019s a dusty tribute to an industry that once dominated the eastern province of Alsace. Oil here was easy to retrieve \u2014 so close to the surface that local boars would often be spotted rolling in the puddles, which formed after leaks \u2014 and so became a major economic force in the area, peaking in the 1920s when more than 650 wells dotted the landscape. Almost a century later, barely a dozen are active; it was the discovery of abundant oil reserves in the then-French Sahara in the 1960s that effectively ended Alsace\u2019s oil-powered boom. That should dwindle further after President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government announced in December that all oil and natural gas exploration would be outlawed on French soil by 2040.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s Disappearance: What We Know and Don\u2019t Know", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe disappearance of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi has set off a diplomatic feud between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, a bipartisan uproar in the United States Congress, tremors of uncertainty in Wall Street and Silicon Valley about how to deal with Saudi Arabia, and a noisy spat between the White House and its closest Arab ally.American officials have speculated that if Saudi Arabia confirms suspicions that Mr. Khashoggi was killed, it would propose that rogue elements acted on their own, not under orders from the highest levels of power in the kingdom. Turkish officials have described a grisly assassination and cover-up, with Saudi agents dismembering the body for disposal.Turkish news organizations reported on Monday that Saudi Arabia would open its consulate to a search by investigators from both countries \u2014 something the kingdom has promised before but not yet allowed. And King Salman of Saudi Arabia reportedly ordered Saudi prosecutors to open their own investigation.The furor over Mr. Khashoggi, last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, has severely damaged the image in the West of Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The crown prince, 33, has worked hard to portray himself as a reformer determined to open up the kingdom\u2019s culture and economy, but Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance is undermining Prince Mohammed\u2019s efforts to lure technology companies and Wall Street investors to Saudi Arabia to help wean it from dependence on oil.The complex, confusing case raises a range of important questions, some with ready answers and some without:He had worked in the Saudi embassies in Washington and London, and some suspected he had also worked for Saudi intelligence. Then, over years in the Saudi news media, he established himself as a kind of unofficial spokesman for the royal family, which often preferred to speak through surrogates.His independent streak and empathy for the Western perspective made him a uniquely important, well-liked contact for foreign journalists and diplomats seeking to understand the royal perspective.Then came Mohammed bin Salman, who became crown prince last year and has consolidated unrivaled control over the levers of power inside the kingdom.After that, Mr. Khashoggi felt there was no longer room in Saudi Arabia for even his relatively modest degree of independence. He relocated to Virginia, became a columnist for The Washington Post, and reinvented himself as the crown prince\u2019s most prominent critic in the West.Under the strain of his voluntary exile from Saudi Arabia, his marriage had ended in a divorce, and he had since become engaged to a Turkish woman. Mr. Khashoggi needed certification from the Saudi authorities of his divorce so that he could remarry in Turkey; the wedding was planned for the next day.The Turkish authorities have released video footage of him walking into the consulate, but they say there is none of him walking out. The Saudis, while insisting that he left the consulate safely, have not offered any evidence.Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e waited for him outside the consulate for hours.If Mr. Khashoggi was killed or abducted by Saudi operatives, Prince Mohammed would have had to have authorized the plan, experts on the kingdom\u2019s internal workings say.The prince has shown little tolerance for critics of the Saudi government, and many of those who have spoken out have been jailed. So it is reasonable to assume he was not a fan of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s.Until recently, Saudi Arabia welcomed members of the Muslim Brotherhood fleeing persecution in other Arab states, especially Egypt. Then Arab Spring uprisings convinced leaders of the royal family that the Brotherhood threatened them, too, and Saudi Arabia declared the group a terrorist organization.United States intelligence agencies had reportedly intercepted Saudi communications about the possible abduction of Mr. Khashoggi at the request of the crown prince, according to a senior former American official. But there is no indication that those discussions were related to Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s visit to the consulate.The day Mr. Khashoggi disappeared, 15 Saudi agents flew into Istanbul on two private jets chartered by a company with close ties to the crown prince and the Saudi Interior Ministry, the Turks say. The agents waited for Mr. Khashoggi inside the consulate and killed him within two hours of his arrival, the Turkish officials contend.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, a personal friend of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s, has repeatedly demanded an explanation from the Saudis but has not made specific accusations.Prince Mohammed and other Saudi officials have denied any knowledge of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s whereabouts, insisting without evidence that he left the consulate freely.It is also unclear whether Turkey has shared its evidence with allies like the United States or Britain.Turkish intelligence often cooperates closely with Western intelligence agencies, and the Turks could presumably share their evidence with those partners without exposing their sources. Sharing the evidence with Western governments \u2014 not just describing it to them \u2014 would increase the pressure on Saudi Arabia to explain more about Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fate.Experts have pointed to another, more cynical possible explanation for Turkey\u2019s reticence about releasing evidence: It may quietly seek some kind of deal with Saudi Arabia that could prevent full disclosure.Turkey and Saudi Arabia are regional rivals on opposite sides of an ideological feud over Brotherhood-style political Islam. But until now, the two countries have worked hard to bridge their disagreements, in the interest of working together on areas of common interest, like the Syrian civil war.Laboring under an economic crisis brought on by excessive borrowing, Turkey can ill afford a long-running conflict with a wealthy trading partner like Saudi Arabia. It might even welcome Saudi aid or investment.Turkey could accept that explanation, both sides could move on, and the world would never learn the truth about what evidence, if any, the Turkish authorities had.On the other hand Mr. Trump vowed over the weekend that there would be \u201csevere punishment\u201d if Saudi Arabia were proved to have killed Mr. Khashoggi.That threat drew an extraordinary pushback from the Saudis. If Saudi Arabia \u201creceives any action, it will respond with greater action,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said in a statement, citing the oil-rich kingdom\u2019s \u201cinfluential and vital role in the global economy.\u201dSaudi Arabia \u201caffirms its total rejection of any threats and attempts to undermine it, whether by threatening to impose economic sanctions, using political pressures, or repeating false accusations,\u201d the Foreign Ministry said.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "For Canada, a Sigh of Relief More Than a Celebration in New Nafta Deal", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTORONTO \u2014 More than a celebration, it ended with a huge sigh of relief.Canadians awoke on Monday to the news of a new trade deal with the United States, its largest trading partner, and more important, a reprieve from the threat of crippling auto tariffs that President Trump had been holding over the country for months.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada came away with a few items considered sacred for his nation\u2019s economic security: a dispute resolution system for companies that feel unjustly targeted with taxes and a distant expiration date to the agreement.In exchange, Canada promised to crack open its long-protected dairy market \u2014 the target of Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter attacks and rally tirades for months \u2014 to American competition, a concession that drew immediate anger from politicians in Quebec, home to nearly half of the country\u2019s 11,200 dairy farms.At a news conference in Ottawa on Monday, Mr. Trudeau called the agreement \u201ca good deal,\u201d although he acknowledged the trade-offs.\u201cLike any important negotiation, we had to make compromises,\u201d he said, speaking in French. But, he added, \u201ctoday is a good day for Canada.\u201d\u201cThe great failure of this trade deal was not negotiating an end to the steel and aluminum tariffs,\u201d said Philip Cross, the former chief economic analyst at Statistics Canada, a government agency, because it tacitly left the door open to Mr. Trump to use the same national protection justification to lay more tariffs in the future, regardless of any trade deal.\u201cHe can invoke national security under this deal and slap tariffs presumably on anything he wants,\u201d said Mr. Cross, who is now a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute, a research group based in Ottawa. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we got the guaranteed secure access to the U.S. that free trade was supposed to give us.\u201dStill, several economists said that although the deal would most likely not bolster the Canadian economy, it was unlikely to hurt it much, either.The concessions on dairy enraged politicians in Quebec, the country\u2019s second-largest province and the center of the dairy industry. All four party leaders vying for votes in the provincial election on Monday rejected the Canadian government\u2019s promise of compensation for farmers.\u201cIt is an expression of the systematic injustice that Quebec is suffering within Canada,\u201d the leader of the separatist Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lis\u00e9e, told reporters.During much of the negotiations, Mr. Trump had threatened to impose 25 percent tariffs on Canadian autos and auto parts crossing into the United States, which would have crippled the Ontario economy, putting an estimated 250,000 people out of work, according to one forecast. It would also have become a potent issue in Mr. Trudeau\u2019s re-election campaign next year.The new agreement \u2014 which renames the North American Free Trade Agreement as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2014 neutralizes that threat by effectively exempting Canada\u2019s exports to the United States. By requiring 40 percent of auto parts to come from so-called \u201chigh wage factories,\u201d it could even give unionized Canadian auto manufacturers a leg-up.\u201cI would argue we are in better shape today than we\u2019ve been in the last 24 years,\u201d Jerry Dias, the head of Canada\u2019s largest private sector union, Unifor, said on a morning Canadian Broadcasting Corporation radio show. \u201cSo I\u2019m absolutely thrilled with where we ended up.\u201dHe added: \u201cLook, we hung tough right to the bitter end. We got what we needed. We didn\u2019t fold in the areas that the U.S. wanted us to fold in, so we\u2019re in pretty good shape today.\u201dCompared with Mr. Trump, who triumphantly claimed the deal would see \u201ccash and jobs pouring into the United States and into North America,\u201d Mr. Trudeau was gracious and understated during his news conference.For him, the deal was more about shoring up the Canadian economy than expanding it. \u201cWe preserved the most important parts of Nafta,\u2019\u2019 Mr. Trudeau said.The agreement will be good for the economy, good for workers, he said, and made North America \u201ca much more stable place than it was yesterday.\u201dCompleting the deal capped what had been an exhausting and turbulent process for the prime minister who, with the election looming, had at times appeared vulnerable and stumbling beneath a shower of insults from Mr. Trump.Many thought Mr. Trudeau was in an impossible position \u2014 trying to get a deal he could sell as good for his country, and maintaining his dignity when dealing with the unpredictable Mr. Trump.The test for Mr. Trudeau, who faces an election next year, will be whether he can persuade voters that Nafta 2.0 is a \u201cwin-win-win,\u201d as he has long assured them it would be.\u201cJustin Trudeau has to take the high ground on this fairly quickly,\u201d said Shachi Kurl, the executive director of the Angus Reid Institute, a nonprofit polling organization based in Vancouver. \u201cCan he sell the deal?\u201dAlmost from the beginning of his candidacy for president, Mr. Trump has criticized Nafta, and especially the provisions relating to Canada \u2014 a drumbeat that has not let up.That added additional drama to the negotiations, which Canadians have followed with the rapt attention normally reserved for hockey playoffs.Despite harboring a deepening dislike for Mr. Trump, Canadians largely accept that the country cannot survive economically without its larger, more powerful neighbor. Almost three-quarters of Canada\u2019s exports flow south across the border.The polarization of American politics, the uncertainty of what kind of trade deal Congress would accept and how the midterm elections in the United States would change things has made most Canadians throw up their hands in exasperation.Then there was Mr. Trump, who to Canadians seems immune to fact; approaches every deal as a tug-of-war; and has taken to insulting the United States\u2019 longstanding ally and neighbor publicly.\u201cHe\u2019s weaponized uncertainty,\u201d said John Higginbotham, a senior fellow at Carleton University in Ottawa who was the second-highest-ranking Canadian diplomat in Washington for six years.\u201cYou can\u2019t call his bluff with impunity,\u201d he added. \u201cHe\u2019s not playacting, he\u2019s a bit crazy. He is a bit crazy.\u201dJust last week, Mr. Trump said that he did not like Canada\u2019s representative \u2014 presumably referring to Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland \u2014 \u201cvery much,\u201d and that he had purposely snubbed Mr. Trudeau, by refusing to meet with him at the United Nations. (Mr. Trudeau\u2019s office said no request for a meeting was ever made.)Mr. Trudeau deployed an army of charmers across the border to build alliances with people around Mr. Trump.The Canadian government countered with tariffs on $12.6 billion of American imports.Since then, the relationship between the two countries \u2014 and the two leaders \u2014 has further soured.In June, at the end of a two-day Group of 7 summit meeting in Charlevoix, Quebec, Mr. Trudeau said at a news conference that Canada would not be bullied on trade.\u201cAs Canadians,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are polite, we\u2019re reasonable, but also we will not be pushed around.\u201dSome thought Mr. Trudeau was outmatched by Mr. Trump.\u201cThere was some illusion that sending a couple progressive people from the prime minister\u2019s office to see Ivanka, that would solve the problem,\u201d said Mr. Higginbotham, referring to the president\u2019s elder daughter.But many Canadians believe the American administration has not been negotiating in good faith \u2014 a position supported by Mr. Trump telling Bloomberg last month that any deal with Canada would be \u201ctotally on our terms.\u201dAnd most agreed that Mr. Trudeau and his foreign minister, Ms. Freeland, had been put in tricky positions.\u201cI\u2019m not sure they had a lot of choice,\u201d said Don Campbell, a former Canadian ambassador and high-level government official who was involved in setting up the first iteration of Nafta.\u201cThey are dealing with an unprecedented situation, with a president who is not rational or consistent in his approach, who disregards facts and who does not tell the truth,\u201d he said.Dan Bilefsky contributed reporting from Montreal.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "E.U. Rejects Italy\u2019s Budget, and Populists Dig In", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byROME \u2014 In what is becoming a dangerous game of chicken for the global economy, Italy\u2019s populist government refused to budge on Tuesday after the European Union for the first time sent back a member state\u2019s proposed budget because it violated the bloc\u2019s fiscal laws and posed unacceptable risks.The European Commission, the bloc\u2019s administrative body, had repeatedly warned Italy to reduce the deficits in its 2019 draft budget to avoid heavy fines early next year. But Italy\u2019s populist government, which has bristled against Europe\u2019s austerity measures, went ahead and submitted a budget with a proposed deficit equal to 2.4 percent of gross domestic product. That figure was considered much too high for a country whose total government debt equals 131 percent of G.D.P., more than double the eurozone limit.As expected, the commission rejected the plan, saying that it included irresponsible deficit levels that would \u201csuffocate\u201d Italy, the third-largest economy in the eurozone. Investors fear that the collapse of the Italian economy under its enormous debt could sink the entire eurozone and hasten a global economic crisis unseen since 2008, or worse.But Italy\u2019s populists are not scared. They have repeatedly compared their budget, fat with unemployment welfare, pension increases and other benefits, to the New Deal measures of Franklin D. Roosevelt that helped America emerge from the Great Depression.\u201cThe only thing that we have to fear is fear itself,\u201d Luigi Di Maio, Italy\u2019s vice premier and the leader of the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, told reporters as it became clear that the European Commission would reject the plan.After the official rejection, Mr. Di Maio wrote on Facebook, \u201cWe know that we are on the right path, and therefore we won\u2019t stop.\u201dHis coalition partner and fellow vice premier, Matteo Salvini, the leader of the far-right League party, was equally scathing. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t change anything. Let the speculators be reassured, we\u2019re not going back,\u201d he told reporters during a trip to Romania. \u2018\u2018They\u2019re not attacking a government but a people. These are things that will anger Italians even more.\u201dItaly has three weeks to revise its budget under the bloc\u2019s rules, but the European Union\u2019s unprecedented response may just be the instigation to a fight that Mr. Di Maio and his coalition partners have been itching for.Both the Five Star and the League ran for election this year in direct opposition to Brussels. With European Parliament elections on the horizon in May, it doesn\u2019t hurt their cause to reintroduce the specter of a bureaucratic boogeyman preventing them from stimulating the Italian economy and delivering on their campaign promises.All of which make for strong political arguments that resonate with angry Italian voters who have yet to recover from the last debt crisis. Still, the markets are less moved by the talking points.Mr. Salvini and Mr. Di Maio have at times spoken with disgust or derision about the yield spread between Italian and German 10-year benchmark bonds as if it were just another political enemy to be demonized or ridiculed. (The \u201cspread,\u201d Mr. Salvini has joked, is what he put on his breakfast bread.)But the spread is no joke. Detested as it might be among Italy\u2019s populist politicians, it has become perhaps the international markets\u2019 most powerful judgment of the health of eurozone economies.In the 2011 European bond crises, it laid waste to the bloc\u2019s governments \u2014 including, notably, that of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign because of a lack of confidence from the international markets.Giuseppe Conte, the prime minister of Italy, has suggested that leaders in Brussels have sought to raise fears about the Italian economy in order to spike the spread and force his government to bow to European rules. Mr. Di Maio has said \u201cenemies of the people\u201d were working to increase the spread.The question for Italy, and all of Europe, is how far Italy\u2019s government is willing to go. Will it be forced into submission by the gravity of economic reality? Or will Italian leaders convince their voters that the country\u2019s financial health is worth risking in order to blow up a political and economic establishment that they say is stripping Italians of their sovereignty?And Brussels must decide how strict it will be. Loath to let a member state slide for fear that it would loosen the ties that bind the union, its leaders must ask themselves if that is worse than an open revolt.\u201cBreaking rules can appear tempting at a first look,\u201d said Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission\u2019s vice president in charge of the euro and financial stability.\u201cIt can provide the illusion of breaking free,\u2019\u2019 he added. \u2018\u2018It is tempting to try to cure debt with more debt. But at some point, the debt weighs too heavy, and at the end of the day you end up having no freedom at all.\u201dMr. Dombrovskis called Italy\u2019s budget \u201cconsciously going against commitments made\u201d and said \u201cthe ball is now in the court of Italy\u2019s government.\u201dThat ball has already wrought havoc inside the Italian government.At the end of September, Italy\u2019s populists agreed on a budget that delivered on the priorities of both the Five Star, which sought a broad unemployment benefit, and the League, which wanted a flat tax for small business owners. It also included more generous pension benefits, allowing people to retire at 62 if they had contributed for 38 years, which both parties campaigned on.\u201cIn a decisive manner, with this measure, with this budget, we will have abolished poverty,\u201d Mr. Di Maio said at the time.Italy\u2019s leaders have complained they are being unfairly singled out by the European Union, and Mr. Di Maio has threatened new elections if the bloc doesn\u2019t approve the 2.4 percent deficit.The previous, center-left government had proposed a budget with a 0.8 percent deficit, which would have allowed Italy to continue chipping away at its total debt.Establishment forces inside the government, including Economics Minister Giovanni Tria, sought to shrink the proposed deficit level but were outmaneuvered by the populists. At one point, a member of the League shut off Mr. Tria\u2019s microphone to keep him from talking about the budget.But the major pressure on Italy\u2019s budget has come from outside Italy. Fitch Ratings issued a negative evaluation of the budget, and Moody\u2019s dropped its rating for Italian bonds to one level above \u201cjunk\u201d last week.As the spreads rose, Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner in charge of economic and fiscal affairs, provoked the government\u2019s rage when he said Italians had chosen a xenophobic government.As Mr. Moscovici left the news conference on Tuesday, a member of the European Parliament with the League party, Angelo Ciocca, snatched the commissioner\u2019s papers and pounded them with his shoe, which he later wrote on Twitter, was \u201cmade in Italy.\u201dTop members of the Five Star echoed that critique, calling the European leaders \u201cslaves of alcohol.\u201d Beppe Grillo, the movement\u2019s co-founder, wrote on his blog last week that he suspected Mr. Junker of having neurological problems, and featured a picture of him looking unwell.Mr. Conte, Italy\u2019s prime minister, sought to bring down the temperature as investor fears of a confrontation rose.On Monday, he assured reporters at the foreign press club that Italy\u2019s budget dispute with Brussels could be settled through negotiation, with a nod to President George H.W. Bush\u2019s famous \u201cread my lips: no new taxes\u201d pledge at the 1988 Republican National Convention.\u201cRead my lips,\u201d Mr. Conte said, switching to English for emphasis. \u201cFor Italy there is no chance, no way to get \u2018Italexit.\u2019 There is no way to get out of Europe, of the eurozone.\u201dMr. Bush agreed to raise taxes.Jason Horowitz reported from Rome, and Steven Erlanger from Brussels.

{"Headline": "In Khashoggi Disappearance, Turkey\u2019s Slow Drip of Leaks Puts Pressure on Saudis", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byJournalists gathered outside the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul on Monday as investigators arrived to look into the disappearance of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi.The calculated media strategy has proved remarkably effective for the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, ensuring that the case remains front-page news around the world.But it has also served a deeper agenda \u2014 to push the United States to pressure Saudi Arabia \u2014 while shielding the government behind the news media to avoid an open and potentially damaging diplomatic rupture with the Saudis.From the start, reports of the existence of the audio recordings were brandished almost as a threat by Turkish officials and pro-government news outlets, evidently to maintain pressure on Saudi Arabia, but also on the Trump administration, to resolve the issue to Turkey\u2019s taste.Political analysts noted that Mr. Erdogan seemed to increase the pressure by releasing descriptions of audio recordings after it appeared that President Trump would offer cover to Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, known as M.B.S., by promoting the Saudi line that the death had been the work of \u201crogue killers.\u201d\u201cErdogan had hoped that Trump and the Saudis would take the exit path of throwing someone senior under the bus,\u201d said Soner Cagaptay, the director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cBut when Trump starting trending toward defending M.B.S., Erdogan released more details to build pressure on them.\u201dEven on Friday, still more details of the investigation emerged, as the police extended their search to three locations in and around Istanbul where, according to a Turkish official, vehicles from the Saudi Consulate were seen driving in the hours after Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. The official spoke on the condition that he not be named because of diplomatic proprieties.Yet no newspaper has actually obtained the audio or even listened to it, allowing the government not only to safeguard their provenance but also to maintain control over how much it reveals \u2014 and when.The abiding irony of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s case is that, while pushing out details of the case to chosen outlets, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government has itself been openly hostile to independent journalists. So has Mr. Trump, if not nearly to the same degree.After 15 years in power, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s government exerts enormous control over Turkey\u2019s news media through purchases of major television and newspaper outlets by companies close to the government. Since a failed coup in 2016, scores of journalists have been imprisoned, more than 100 news outlets have been closed, and independent voices have been suppressed.In the case of Mr. Khashoggi, however, that same news media has proved useful as the government seeks to increase its leverage for a deal that could include money from the oil-rich Saudi kingdom to bail out Turkey\u2019s beleaguered economy.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, second from left, meeting with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, center, and Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in Ankara on Wednesday.The success of the campaign of leaks, and the gripping controversy around the case, may now be expanding the government\u2019s ambitions, emboldening it to undermine Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, who is seen as unfriendly to Turkey\u2019s interests.\u201cInitially, it seemed Turkey was seeking a bargain with or financial support from Saudi Arabia,\u201d said Amanda Sloat, a former State Department official now at the Brookings Institution. \u201cBut it increasingly appears that Turkey is seeking to inflict maximum damage on M.B.S.\u201dIt is not clear what Mr. Erdogan is demanding, but the policy of official leaks has been clearly to prevent a complete whitewash of the disappearance. Pro-government columnists have called for the Saudi crown prince to go.Hilal Kaplan, one of the most outspoken columnists, known to be close to the president and strongly anti-American, even suggested in her column Friday that the United States could be blamed as an accessory in Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s murder.\u201cIf the U.S. administration continues this defensive line of language in favor of M.B.S. and reiterates mostly what they want to hear, one would fairly wonder if Trump and his Middle East peace envoy Jared Kushner also had prior knowledge of this atrocity to come and did nothing.\u201dIf the government\u2019s motivations remain obscure, its media strategy has been equally \u2014 and unusually \u2014 discreet for a government not shy of outright confrontation. It has also been effective.In the early days, the leaks were pushed especially toward American news media \u2014 including The New York Times and The Washington Post \u2014 in order to engage American interest and support for Turkey\u2019s position, a Turkish official involved in the campaign said.Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was encouraged to write opinion pieces in American newspapers, prompting Turkish newspapers to complain that the Turkish public also wanted to hear from her.The staunchly pro-government newspaper Sabah was one of the first Turkish news outlets to publish an exclusive after Abdurrahman Simsek, who heads the investigative unit, said he complained directly to government officials that Turkish newspapers were not getting information on the case.\u201cWe got angry at them \u2014 \u2018Why are you giving it to the foreign press while we are here?\u2019 \u201d he recalled complaining.Once the West was engaged in the case, and foreign news organizations poured into Istanbul and set up cameras outside the Saudi Consulate, the Turkish government reverted to its more standard way of operating, feeding information to the Turkish newspapers, mostly through trusted reporters known for their links to security officials, such as Mr. Simsek and his team.Turkey\u2019s handling of the affair has been the exact opposite of Mr. Erdogan\u2019s usual tactics on the international scene. When he fell out with Germany last year, for instance, he publicly excoriated Chancellor Angela Merkel and her officials, even comparing them to Nazis.But from the start of the Khashoggi affair, Turkish officials said, they were cautious to avoid any direct confrontation with Saudi Arabia because of Turkey\u2019s fragile economic and political situation.Media gather and wait as Saudi Arabia\u2019s consulate is cordoned off by Turkish police in Istanbul.\u201cThat would have led to a crisis of major proportions,\u201d said Asli Aydintasbas, a senior fellow with the European Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe story would no longer have been about Jamal, but about the Turkish-Saudi spat, and Turkey would no longer be believed.\u201dPolitically, Mr. Erdogan is in a vulnerable position, Ms. Aydintasbas said. The economy is faltering with a falling lira and a looming banking crisis. Yet Turkey has few friends positioned to help it.Relations with most European Union members are badly damaged, and Turkey has been embroiled in an ugly diplomatic wrangle with the United States. In the Middle East, Mr. Erdogan has ended up on the opposing side from the powerful triumvirate of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt on many issues.Mr. Erdogan and his close circle of advisers even see Saudi Arabia\u2019s hand in a campaign to undermine his government by supporting Kurdish forces in Syria and in supporting the failed coup, a pro-government columnist wrote last week.Mr. Erdogan\u2019s political isolation was evident at the United Nations General Assembly last month, where he had few meetings of significance with other leaders. \u201cHe does not want to be out there in the cold,\u201d Ms. Aydintasbas said.Two Turkish officials expressed outrage at the killing of Mr. Khashoggi, who was known personally to members of the government, in such a brutal and blatant manner inside the Saudi Consulate, but they said Turkey could not go head-to-head with Saudi Arabia and would first seek United States support to bring pressure on Riyadh.Although Turkish officials knew within hours of the disappearance that Mr. Khashoggi had probably been killed, senior officials did not say anything publicly for days. Neither did Mr. Erdogan and his senior spokesmen.The lack of official statements was to avoid an open diplomatic confrontation, the Sabah reporter, Mr. Simsek, said.\u201cWhat I am told by the people doing the investigation is that \u2018I don\u2019t want to say anything because if I do, it might have diplomatic repercussions,\u2019 \u201d he said.Nevertheless, according to one report, Mr. Erdogan was incensed by an interview in which the Saudi crown prince told the Bloomberg News agency that he had no knowledge of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s whereabouts, and even claimed to be looking for him.The leaks started soon after, even if the recordings are being closely guarded by Turkish officials, not least because intelligence services do not want to reveal whether they had placed listening devices inside the consulate, or received them from an informant whose position would be endangered.Mr. Simsek, who has worked the intelligence beat for nearly 20 years, said police and security officials preferred to reach their own conclusions in an investigation before they start talking to the news media.Independent media analysts cast it differently.\u201cIn Turkey, 90 up to 95 percent of the media is directly or indirectly connected to the government,\u201d said Ragip Duran, a media columnist for the ArtiGercek news site. \u201cIn general, their approach is to protect the government rather than tell the public what happened. It is the same in the Khashoggi case.\u201dEric Schmitt contributed reporting from Washington.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Trump Wagers That Voters Will Shrug at a Saudi Storm", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON \u2014 His Democratic opponents do not believe it. His Republican allies don\u2019t buy it. Even President Trump has ample reason, based on the intelligence reports he has seen, to doubt Saudi Arabia\u2019s account of what happened to Jamal Khashoggi.With the midterm elections less than three weeks away and a political base more focused on jobs and the confirmation of Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, Mr. Trump is betting he can stand by his Saudi allies and not suffer any significant damage with voters, allies and analysts said.\u201cI think we\u2019re getting close to solving a big problem,\u201d Mr. Trump said Friday when he was asked about the Saudi confirmation of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death and a shake-up of its intelligence services, to be carried out by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.What matters most to Mr. Trump politically, however, is whether Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death has caught the imagination of voters. Political analysts from both parties said that the answer was almost certainly no \u2014 and that even if they were following the news from Saudi Arabia, they were not likely to vote based on it.\u201cPeople listen to a lot of things and they consider them important, but is it enough to offset the factors that drive their vote?\u201d said David Winston, a Republican political analyst. \u201cProbably not.\u201dMr. Winston pointed to the midterm elections in 2010. The fierce debate over President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law commanded the headlines for months leading up to the ballot. But exit polls suggested that the economy drove voters more than health care.David Axelrod, a Democratic political analyst who advised Mr. Obama, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s calculation is, for the voters he\u2019s trying to motivate, this is of little consequence. He\u2019s placed a bet on the Saudis, and he\u2019s not going to let their behavior interfere with that bet.\u201dMr. Trump does face a potential collision with Congress, where Democrats and Republicans alike dismissed the Saudi explanation, offered more than two weeks after Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s death, as preposterous and demanded that Congress hold the kingdom to account.Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a telephone interview on Saturday, \u201cNothing adds up except that they murdered him.\u201dMr. King said the Saudi account raised several unanswered questions, like how Mr. Khashoggi, who was 59, would have ended up in a fistfight with a team of trained Saudi security personnel. \u201cYou really need 15 guys to get this guy?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt\u2019s not like he\u2019s Mike Tyson.\u201dOn Saturday, 55 lawmakers announced that they were preparing a letter to the director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, asking to see American intercepts of communications in which Saudi officials discussed a plan to capture Mr. Khashoggi, who lived in Virginia and was a columnist for The Washington Post. They also asked Mr. Coats whether the United States had warned Mr. Khashoggi.\u201cThe Saudi explanation just doesn\u2019t pass the smell test,\u201d said Representative Mark Pocan, Democrat of Wisconsin, who helped organize the letter. \u201cOur concern is we are still not getting the truth.\u201dPrivately, Mr. Trump has told colleagues that he shares the skepticism that Mr. Khashoggi could have been killed without any high-level Saudi involvement. In the interview on Thursday, he expressed confidence about the intelligence he was getting about the episode \u2014 intelligence that makes a strong, if circumstantial, case that Prince Mohammed played a role.\u201cWe\u2019re working with the intelligence from numerous countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the best intelligence we could have.\u201dSenator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, has concluded, after being briefed on the American intelligence, that the Saudi account is not credible, according to his spokeswoman, Rachel Cohen.That echoes what Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said a day earlier.Mr. Trump\u2019s ability to ignore difficult situations, however, is longstanding. And in his mind, according to long-serving advisers, he has learned that he is not penalized politically for them.Mr. Trump responded by calling the DNA test \u201cbogus\u201d and returned to mocking her as \u201cPocahontas.\u201dAllies of Mr. Trump said they expected most of his voters to view the furor over Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s killing as a case of journalists taking care of one of their own.When he was asked the next day about the propriety of saying that in the context of Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance, Mr. Trump replied, \u201cThat was a different league and a different world.\u201dEric Schmitt and Julian E.

{"Headline": "33 Unique Treats From All Around the World", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa.

The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands.

According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era.

It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate.

Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa.

Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times.

At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco.

It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry.

{"Headline": "Do Muoi, Vietnam\u2019s Leader in Economic Transition, Dies at 101", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byDo Muoi, a Vietnamese revolutionary who served for six years as the country\u2019s leader during its transition to a market economy under a Communist government, died on Monday in Hanoi. He was 101.His death, at the National Military Hospital, was announced by the government. \u201cComrade Do Muoi had gone through various working positions and made great contributions to the revolutionary cause of the Party and nation,\u201d the announcement said.Mr. Do Muoi was the Communist Party\u2019s general secretary from 1991 to 1997. One Vietnamese news report of his death called him \u201ca prime example of a steadfast communist.\u201dBut he also pushed through difficult economic reforms in the wake of Vietnam\u2019s disastrous attempt to impose a command economy after the Vietnam War ended in 1975.Mr. Do Muoi was general secretary during the crucial years of Vietnam\u2019s transition from communism to the economic liberalization called \u201cdoi moi,\u201d generally translated as \u201crenovation,\u201d which unleashed a burst of pent-up energy in free enterprise.In a process known in China as \u201cpeaceful evolution,\u201d Vietnam hesitantly opened its markets and encouraged free enterprise while maintaining the party\u2019s grip on political and economic affairs.At a party congress in 1996, when he was named to a second term as general secretary, Mr. Do Muoi spoke to foreign reporters of the need to accelerate economic reforms while maintaining party control.\u201cSlow development means hunger, don\u2019t you think?\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, I want to see efficiency and stability.\u201dHe added: \u201cIf reform is too fast, we will make mistakes. If you run too fast and there is something in the road, you may fall down.\u201dAt the time, 80 percent of Vietnam\u2019s mostly rural population of 75 million remained poor.In addition to economic reforms, the government was preoccupied with endemic corruption, which has resisted repeated campaigns for reform.\u201cAs long as governments exist, corruption will exist,\u201d Mr. Do Muoi said. \u201cIt is an illness of government, and it can be cured only by the people. It will be severely punished, even by execution, no matter what position the person was holding.\u201dBorn Nguyen Duy Cong in 1917 in Hanoi, Mr. Do Muoi joined the movement to oust French colonial rule when he was 19. He became a member of the Communist Party in 1939.He described his family as \u201cpoor for many generations.\u201d His official biography makes no mention of formal education.Information about survivors was not released.In 1941 Mr. Do Muoi was arrested by the French and sentenced to 10 years in prison in Hanoi. He escaped four years later and rejoined the revolution.He rose through the ranks of the party and the government and joined the ruling Politburo in 1982. He was appointed prime minister in 1988 before being elevated to general secretary of the party three years later.He was the last member of the wartime old guard to hold a top leadership post. Since he left office Vietnam has been in the hands of men who came of age after the war.Because of a deadlock in the succession when his first term came to an end, his tenure was briefly extended in 1996, delaying the transition to a new generation of leaders. At the time, the average age of the 170-member central committee was 65.Mr. Do Muoi was buoyant about his new lease on life when he spoke to reporters during a lull in the party meeting that voted him a second term.\u201cThey will not let me rest!\u201d he said happily as a clutch of foreign reporters surrounded him. \u201cI am almost 80 and I am still young!\u201dAs if to demonstrate his youth and vigor, he lavished special attention on a young female reporter.\u201cAre you married?\u201d he said when she asked a question about party politics. \u201cWould you like to have a Vietnamese husband?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 12:56 A.M.", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "Documenting moments across the country, large and small, quiet and indelible.Supported byWhen this project was being conceived, a storm named Florence did not exist. It had not formed far off in the Atlantic yet, and it had not swirled toward North Carolina, where it would unload more than 30 inches of rain and remind us again of a simple, elemental truth: The weather contains us, not the other way around.Florence made landfall in Wilmington, N.C., about 25 miles from the Elwell Ferry. The boat, driven by Pat Soesbee and Betty Rose Dolce, crosses the Cape Fear River. As we started our research, a North Carolina official said they may be kin. And indeed they are, cousins who take people from one riverbank to the next. Two cars max, four minutes each way, three if the water is on your side.These women fit squarely with one of the aims of this project: to tell the untold stories of people throughout the United States. People living lives of unannounced grace and dignity.The storm hit just as a New York Times photographer planned to fly to North Carolina. Meteorologists were tracking the nautilus-shaped abstractions soon to blanket screens everywhere. But we learned about Hurricane Florence from a writer riding that ferry. It was local news then \u2014 chatter on a boat, words and niceties as a hull cut through current.Hurricane Florence wasn\u2019t the only event we could not have anticipated. Miles outside Nashville there was an accident. An organ donor died, 20 years old. The heart was flown on a helicopter to the Vanderbilt Transplant Center in Tennessee, where Troy Roberts lay in the operating room, waiting. The photographer Eugene Richards was in Nashville that day to document a transplant team. What he saw was indelible, and his photographs are almost unbearably intimate, a tangle of terror and hope.One of the startling things about the moment he witnessed is that it is both remarkable and, for the transplant team, typical. Dawn broke that morning and the doctors and nurses went to work the same way they always did. They drank their coffee and kissed loved ones goodbye and the day unfolded like any other. By the end, just before 11 p.m. a man had a new heart.Not all of the narratives here are so dramatic. There are quiet hours, too: gestures made and not, words offered, prayers, the near silence right before a bakery clatters to life at 4 in the morning.In tiny Proctor, Ark., two little girls played with Barbies in True Vine Missionary Baptist Church while J.L. Whitfield sermonized from the Gospel According to John. In one of the pews they built a dollhouse out of Bibles. Pastor Whitfield was baptized in the bayou that runs behind the church 54 years ago. Now he was leading the small congregation, sweat beading on his brow.Sunday at noon in the United States. Two girls and their dolls, salvation and stories in the air.

Stark, the little boy, stared out at all of this, a child of the desert in dank, humid air, and then he looked up at his father and said that when he grew up he was going to play professional soccer in Italy, and then he was going to come back to Florida and be a fishing guide.We set out to document 24 different hours in 24 states, to shine a lens on the lives of people rarely in the headlines.

Whitfield, 69, was baptized in the 15-mile bayou that runs behind True Vine Missionary Baptist Church in 1964, but it took him 35 years to get back to this place where he was first made in the spirit. In the intervening time, he came of age, worked as a contractor, had daughters and sons, built two churches with his own hands and led them, and saw his sons join the ministry and lead their own congregations in other Delta towns.His return to his spiritual birthplace was not a matter of if, but rather when \u2014 18 years ago this month.

{"Headline": "Democrats Want to Beat Scott Walker. But the Wisconsin Economy Is a Hurdle.", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRACINE, Wis. \u2014 This city\u2019s downtown was all but empty on a recent Sunday afternoon, but one storefront office was so packed with Democrats that people had to wait outside.One by one, the party\u2019s top Wisconsin candidates took a microphone and fixated on a single villain \u2014 a Republican who drew jeers from the campaign volunteers preparing to make phone calls and walk door to door with clipboards and pleas for votes.The target? Not President Trump, who drew only passing mention. It was Scott Walker, the state\u2019s governor. His eight years in office are the Democrats\u2019 greatest weapon this fall, even as his economic record has become their greatest complication.Randy Bryce, a mustachioed former ironworker who hopes to seize the seat that House Speaker Paul Ryan is leaving, mocked the \u201cScott-holes\u201d that he said plague Wisconsin\u2019s roads.And Tony Evers, a grandfatherly-looking state schools superintendent who is running against Mr. Walker, said that it was high time they hold the governor accountable for cuts to schools, rising health care costs and a state economy that may look dazzling in headlines but, Mr. Evers says, doesn\u2019t always feel that way to residents.Wisconsin, which had not picked a Republican for president since 1984, shocked the country in 2016 by backing Mr. Trump. In hindsight, it shouldn\u2019t have been such a surprise: Mr. Walker and the Republican-controlled Legislature were re-elected in 2014 after slashing taxes, and many Republicans, independents and even some fiscally-minded Democrats saw benefit in a firmer line on the size and costs of government, not to mention lower tax bills.But now there\u2019s a rising debate over whether this state needs more than Mr. Walker\u2019s unbending rectitude. One question for Democrats is whether they can successfully make an economic argument at a time when Wisconsin\u2019s economic indicators are strong. By most metrics, Wisconsin\u2019s economy is doing well. At 3 percent, the state\u2019s unemployment rate is well below the national average of 3.7 percent.Nationally, Democratic leaders are watching Wisconsin closely, in part to understand how to run against a relatively upbeat economy, and in part for lessons for winning back the state in the 2020 presidential election.Kriss Marion, an organic vegetable farmer and Democrat who is running for a Wisconsin State Senate seat that Democrats have targeted as one they might flip, said the president\u2019s name rarely comes up when she is knocking at doors in the small towns and rural, rolling hills of her senate district, which Mr. Trump won in 2016.\u201cI would never bring that up,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s a distraction.\u201dBut the Democrats\u2019 most challenging problem may not be on the ballot.\u201cWisconsin is working,\u201d Mr. Walker told reporters about the economy, after a campaign event not long ago. \u201cDemocrats are trying to tell something to people that\u2019s not true with what they actually know and see.\u201dHe added: \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to turn around now.\u201dFor months, as Wisconsin residents debated the possibility of a \u201cblue wave\u201d of Democratic votes on Election Day, one unlikely voice has repeatedly warned that it could happen: Scott Walker himself.Mr. Walker, who is 50 and seeking a third term in a state where nearly everyone already has an opinion of him, rocked up and down in his sneakers the other day as he waited for his introduction at the edge of a stage in Burlington. He looked impatient to get to work.Wearing an Aaron Rodgers\u2019 Green Bay Packers jersey, Mr. Walker told the crowd of supporters something that most of them might have argued with had it come from anyone else.The polls show a tight race, Mr. Walker warned the crowd, and they should be believed.\u201cDon\u2019t explain the polls by saying they\u2019re wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cExplain the polls by saying that\u2019s all the motivation we need to talk to more voters.\u201d\u201cThe only way we fail to win,\u201d he said, \u201cis if the truth gets blurred over.\u201dIn addition to the state\u2019s 3 percent unemployment rate, wage growth is picking up speed after lagging the rest of the country for much of 2016 and 2017. Average hourly earnings in the state are up five percent from a year ago, compared with a 2.9 percent increase nationally.The turnaround was a long time coming, however. The state lost more than 175,000 jobs between 2008 and 2010 and it took until 2015 for total employment to get back to where it had been before the recession.One of Mr. Walker\u2019s campaign promises during his initial run for governor in 2010 was to create 250,000 jobs in his first term, which ended in early 2015. He reached that goal in April 2018, more than seven years after taking office.\u201cMost people feel that the state is really doing well,\u201d said Rosanne Hahn, a retired teacher who conferred with Mr. Walker outside his Burlington event and said she plans to vote for him. \u201cA lot of times there are many jobs and people won\u2019t take them,\u201d Ms. Hahn said.Mr. Evers, 66, was a teacher and principal before he became the state\u2019s Superintendent of Public Instruction, and he looks the part \u2014 a pen at the ready in his dress shirt pocket, a flop of white hair and a gentle smile.His name is widely known in the state, but his political style is factual and bland, a concern for some Democratic voters who say they wonder whether a more inspirational candidate could better seize the political moment. But some strategists say Mr. Evers, who won the nomination in a wide field of primary candidates, is a safe, ideal choice for keeping the focus not on himself \u2014 but on Mr. Walker\u2019s legacy.By Mr. Evers\u2019s telling, the state\u2019s economic picture may be the centerpiece of Mr. Walker\u2019s campaign, but that doesn\u2019t make it a less potent argument for the Democrats \u2014 largely, he says, because people don\u2019t feel like things are as upbeat as the statistics imply.\u201cHe can talk about the unemployment rate until the cows come home,\u201d Mr. Evers said in an interview. \u201cMost people are just scraping by, so that doesn\u2019t mean anything to them. Many of the people that are employed are having to get two or three jobs just make ends meet. Also, we\u2019re in a state that people are leaving because of the decisions he has made. There\u2019s a lot of data out there other than the unemployment rate.\u201dThis is how Wisconsin Democrats are pivoting from a strict economic pitch to a case that may be easier to make: They say that Mr. Walker\u2019s political philosophy has starved Wisconsin of money for needed services.When Mr. Walker first entered office, he cut spending on schools. Gradual increases followed and the most recent budget had an infusion of new dollars, Tamarine Cornelius, an analyst at the Wisconsin Budget Project, said. But, she added, the new funds were not enough to make up for the initial cut, after adjusting for inflation.Aid to the state\u2019s university system has also been cut under Mr. Walker. In the 2010-11 budget year, state funding totaled $1.179 billion. It dropped by $178 million the following year after he took office, and stood at $1.06 billion in 2017-2018.Around the state, Democrats said they had not felt the benefit of the state\u2019s impressive economic statistics. Manufacturing plays an outsize role here; the factory sector is responsible for 18.6 percent of economic output, compared with 11.7 percent for the United States as a whole. Nearly half a million Wisconsin residents work in manufacturing, up 24,000 since the beginning of 2017, but still shy of the total before the recession.\u201cWhoopee!\u201d Denis Olson, who is 62 and fixes tractors, said of the state\u2019s low unemployment rate. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a job for a buck over minimum wage you can find them. Every low-paying job is hiring, but who can live on that?\u201dIn a state that was once seen as mostly blue but often flipped control back and forth, Democrats view the Wisconsin Senate as one of their most winnable openings. Republicans hold control of the chamber with an 18-15 margin, and Democrats have poured attention into several seats they see as particularly competitive.The district Ms. Marion is trying to seize from a Republican incumbent includes small towns and dairy farms in a rolling, rural section of Southwestern Wisconsin that went for Mr. Trump in 2016, but also Barack Obama before that; it\u2019s a place strategists see as a swing district that could reflect Democrats\u2019 strength in the state this year.Ms. Marion, a county board member who tends a small farm with a bed-and-breakfast, drew statewide attention a few years ago as part of efforts to pass legislation that became known as the \u201cCookie Bill.\u201d State law didn\u2019t authorize bakers to sell their goods at farmers\u2019 markets without commercial licenses, and she wanted to change that, but struggled to get anywhere with the Republican-controlled Legislature. Eventually, she was among a group that sued. A court ruling opened the way for such sales, but Ms. Marion saw the events as telling.\u201cHow simple should that have been to get a cookie bill passed?\u201d she said. \u201cIt was eye opening in terms of how you think you know what democracy is. I\u2019m actually not super into baking cookies, but we just need more opportunities out here.\u201dNot far from Ms. Marion along Main Street, supporters of her opponent, Sen. Howard Marklein, the Republican incumbent and an accountant who grew up on a dairy farm, were handing out Packers\u2019 game schedules and bright yellow Marklein bags to children collecting candy along the street. Mr. Marklein said that farmers are struggling but that his constituents tell him they see the state\u2019s economy as growing and vibrant.\u201cI\u2019ve knocked on thousands of doors,\u201d Mr. Marklein said. \u201cYou talk to businesses, and these are the best years they\u2019ve ever had.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Still, Ms. Marion\u2019s pitch is largely about economic survival and quality of life: Fix the roads. Expand broadband to the rural reaches. Send more money to rural schools.Small towns are struggling, she said, with populations shrinking, schools closing and farmers wrestling with bankruptcies and a growing suicide problem.\u201cIn towns like this, we\u2019re on the edge all the time,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to stay here, but that is by no means a sure thing. It\u2019s sort of like we\u2019re at a crossroads. What\u2019s going to happen?\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Downturn Looms as Leadership Test for California, World\u2019s 5th Largest Economy", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCalifornia is an economic powerhouse \u2014 now the fifth largest economy in the world after surpassing the United Kingdom in total output this year.But this state may be facing a financial reckoning at the very moment that Jerry Brown is stepping down as governor: a possible recession coinciding with deepening concerns about its fiscal stability. His two potential successors \u2014 Gavin Newsom, the Democratic lieutenant governor, and John Cox, a Republican business executive \u2014 have significantly less experience than Mr. Brown, a fixture in California for nearly a half a century and through five national recessions.California is now on the verge of putting one of the world\u2019s largest economies in the hands of a relatively untested governor.The ability of Mr. Brown\u2019s successor to navigate California through challenging fiscal times could be critical to assuring both the state\u2019s continuing economic durability and its outsize contribution to national prosperity.\u201cSo goes California, so goes the U.S.,\u201d said Christopher Thornberg, the founding partner of Beacon Economics, a consulting firm in Los Angeles. \u201cIt is far and away a dominant source of job growth in the U.S.\u201dAmid all its successes, California has become a stark example of economic disparity, illustrated by the juxtaposition of homes selling for tens of millions of dollars in the hills of Los Angeles and colonies of tents a few miles away along Sunset Boulevard. A disproportionate amount of this state\u2019s wealth is being generated in the Bay Area, where an explosion of new tech companies has produced jobs with six- and seven-digit salaries. In Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon Valley, average pay tops $130,000 per year.A severe lack of affordable housing has fueled concern by business and political leaders of a labor shortage, because there will be no place middle-class people can afford to live. \u201cWe are going to have a two-million-person gap in about 20 years,\u201d said Anthony Rendon, the Democratic speaker of the State Assembly. \u201cI can see that getting bigger if we can\u2019t figure out the housing crisis.\u201dPolicies embraced by President Trump \u2014 including tariffs on Chinese goods and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants \u2014 could be harmful to this state\u2019s economy, home to a vast network of farms already struggling to find field workers, and to the nation\u2019s two largest ports.The tax bill enacted by Congress is raising the cost of living for many homeowners by limiting the deductibility of state and local taxes, which are high in California, though some have done better under the new code. A drive to repeal a gas tax, on the ballot this fall, could undercut Mr. Brown\u2019s ambitious effort to rebuild roads and bridges and blast a hole in the next governor\u2019s budget.And by nearly every account, a national recession is overdue. Another economic downturn could be especially devastating to this state, with a tax system heavily reliant on high-income wage earners. The last one resulted in the loss of one million jobs across the state.\u201cJerry Brown has warned of the chances some headwinds on the economy coming down the pike are pretty high \u2014 we are not prepared for that,\u201d said Austin Beutner, a former Wall Street investment banker and deputy mayor of Los Angeles, who is the superintendent of the Los Angeles school district. \u201cWe haven\u2019t modernized the tax base and reformed the property tax system. We haven\u2019t done the hard work to make sure if there is a change or a correction, the resources are there to do the things the state has to do.\u201dMr. Newsom and Mr. Cox have both spoken of the huge economic challenges facing the state, pointing to widespread poverty and homelessness that both men \u2014 invoking the same phrase \u2014 say, \u201chappened on our watch.\u201dHey, I\u2019m Alex Burns, a politics correspondent for The Times. Send me your questions using the NYT app. I\u2019ll give you the latest intel from the campaign trail.Their responses reflect their political philosophies. Mr. Cox has called for cuts in taxes and regulations, while Mr. Newsom has advocated increased spending on early childhood development, higher education and health care. But both Mr. Newsom and Mr. Cox have steered clear on offering detailed plans on how they might manage one of the world\u2019s most powerful economies.\u201cThe California Dream is predicated on upward mobility and the upward mobility cannot exist if people can\u2019t afford to live here,\u201d Mr. Newsom said in an interview. \u201cThe issues that are highlighted in terms of how we are not performing are legit. The richest and the poorest state. It has to be addressed.\u201dMr. Cox, in contrast to Mr. Brown and Mr. Newsom, said he did not think a recession was necessarily in the state\u2019s near future. Still, he described California as a place that had become increasingly difficult to live in.\u201cThe economy has grown,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cAnd it has obviously helped people at the top. And everyone is working, the unemployment rate is pretty low. But people can\u2019t make it here. And a lot of people are thinking of moving.\u201d\u201cWhat Governor Brown has done is try to maintain a certain amount of fiscal discipline in his party, which I don\u2019t see the next Democratic governor doing,\u201d said Juliet Musso, a professor of state government at the University of Southern California. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard a lot of talk about fiscal reform, and that\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to play with the base he has been speaking to.\u201dMr. Newsom said he would prove to be as much of a fiscal steward as Mr. Brown. \u201cI think people, to the extent they are concerned, I think they\u2019ll be soon assuaged of that concern,\u201d he said.But in the same interview, he said he would push to restore cuts in early childhood education and higher education that took place under Mr. Brown. He has also called for a statewide single-payer health care system. \u201cIt\u2019s time to guarantee prenatal care, in-home nurse visits, and access to quality pre-K for every child in California,\u201d he said in his latest television advertisement.California\u2019s economy is a colossus, with a diverse set of industries that is unmatched in the United States. There is Silicon Valley in the Bay Area, which has become a dominant economic driver in the state. The farms that blanket the state\u2019s vast center grow two-thirds of the nation\u2019s fruits and nuts. The entertainment industry is still thriving in Hollywood (or more accurately, across Los Angeles.) And Southern California is home to two ports that receive nearly 40 percent of all foreign goods shipped into the country, plus a sprawling warehouse and transportation network needed to distribute them across the country.This state has accounted for 20 percent of the nation\u2019s economic growth since the end of the Great Recession. Unemployment is at a historic low. And after struggling under a $26 billion deficit, the state has a budget surplus of nearly $16 billion.But at the same time, the gap between the richest and poorest is wider here than almost anywhere in the country. California\u2019s poverty rate, at 19 percent, is the highest of any state.The state\u2019s ability to finance its operations has been complicated by two powerful forces. The first is Proposition 13, an initiative passed by voters in 1978 that imposed caps on property taxes. The second is its income tax system, which is volatile because it is heavily reliant on the top 1 percent of income tax payers. About 70 percent of the state\u2019s revenues come from personal income tax.There has been a clamor to change Proposition 13 \u2014 which would likely require another voter initiative \u2014 and to rewrite the income tax system to make it more reliable. But Mr. Brown was governor when Proposition 13 was passed in 1978 and it was a searing experience for him: He campaigned against it, but quickly moved to embrace it after voters rebuffed him.Over these past eight years, he has refrained from tackling either Proposition 13 or the state tax system, making it clear he saw both as losing battles.If Mr. Brown, who enjoyed abundant political capital and good will, was not willing to take on the fight, it seems unlikely that Mr. Newsom or Mr. Cox are going to step into that ring. \u201cIt\u2019s not politically popular to say let\u2019s try to have a less progressive income tax system,\u201d Professor Musso said.Both Mr. Newsom and Mr. Cox said they agreed the tax system needed to be reformed, but have resisted offering detailed ideas on how they would enter such politically complicated terrain.Mr. Cox for example, said he would look for \u201cother sources of revenue.\u201d When asked for examples, he responded: \u201cI don\u2019t know. But I\u2019d be more insistent on cutting the spending. I think this state wastes incredible amounts of money.\u201dThe revamp of the tax code enacted by Congress could prove damaging to California if wealthy people start fleeing to lower-tax states. \u201cThe difference between California and other states is now much larger, and we have no idea of how people are going to react to that,\u201d said Irena Asmundson, the chief economist at the California Department of Finance.But the next governor will have one advantage that Mr. Brown did not. Mr. Brown pressed the Legislature, as the economy recovered, to create a rainy-day fund to carry the state through an economic downturn \u2014 a buffer against the kind of cuts imposed eight years ago. There is now $14 billion in the fund.Toni G. Atkins, the Democratic president pro tem of the State Senate, applauded the creation of the fund, but noted that it was dwarfed by the size of the deficit the state faced during the last recession.\u201cThat amount of money doesn\u2019t go as far as you think,\u201d she said. \u201cWe know what it felt like to go through a decade of serious recession. We had a really hard time. I am part of a last class of legislators who came here when we faced a $26 billion deficit. Those who came after us may feel somewhat different. They didn\u2019t have to make $26 billion in cuts.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Making Sense of Canada\u2019s Cannabis", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLike many things in Canada, exactly what legal marijuana means varies by province. But there\u2019s no doubt that the country\u2019s fractured and not fully prepared system will nevertheless bring significant social, economic and legal changes and challenges. Canada is the first major industrialized economy to take this on. Its success or failure with legal recreational marijuana will likely become a model \u2014 or a warning \u2014 for the rest of the world.It\u2019s not often that Canada is a global example, and so for much of the past few weeks, Catherine Porter, our Toronto bureau chief; Dan Bilefsky, the correspondent in Montreal, and I have worked on articles linked to Wednesday\u2019s legalization.This week\u2019s change, however, will eclipse all of that, and it is very much part of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s political agenda. During the 2015 election campaign, he vowed to legalize marijuana by last July 1, a deadline that politicking in Canada\u2019s unelected Senate made impossible to meet.That pledge was, at best, a minor factor in Mr. Trudeau\u2019s election success. And Canadians have always been mixed in their views about legalization. To deal with those concerns, the government emphasizes that its legalization is not about encouraging marijuana use among Canadians. Mr. Trudeau and his ministers instead pitched their law as a way to end ruining people\u2019s lives because of marijuana-related criminal records and as a better method for keeping marijuana away from children and profits from its sale away from organized crime.In many ways, it often feels like I\u2019ve gone back to the late 1990s, when I was reporting on tech startups. The stock market value of each of the three largest players in Big Weed is now well over $10 billion. But all of those companies report losses in the tens of millions of dollars from their current medical marijuana businesses. The question now is whether some of those companies will meet the fate of many tech firms after the dot-com bubble burst, and how many will meet their investors\u2019 dreams.Driving while impaired by drugs has long been a crime in Canada. While the penalties for it have now been increased, the government has admitted that police are lagging when it comes to things like the blood-testing systems necessary to lay charges. Nor does it appear that the police will be making much of an effort to shut down the illegal marijuana shops that have popped up in many cities.Somewhat lost in the discussion here in Canada has been its health effects. While a lot remains unknown, no medical group in Canada endorses regular marijuana use. Aside from the ill effects of smoking anything, there are concerns about how marijuana alters the brains of users who are under the age of 25.Advertisement"}

And they display selected statistics to individual drivers as motivating tools, like \u201cYou\u2019re in the top 10 percent of partners!\u201dUber uses the accelerometer in drivers\u2019 phones along with GPS and gyroscope to give them safe driving reports, tracking their performance in granular detail. One driver posted to a forum that a grade of 210 out of 247 \u201csmooth accelerations\u201d earned a \u201cGreat work!\u201d from the boss. A driver in New York City told me about the first time he realized how upfront pricing worked. \u201cA passenger and I started talking about it during the trip, and he offered to show me his invoice at the end of the trip,\u201d he said. \u201cSeeing it for real just outraged me so much! It was like somebody had cheated on me.\u201d The passenger shrugged it off, until he saw that he had been charged $40 for a ride that should have cost only $28. \u201cThen suddenly he got it, too!\u201d Whether we realize it or not, algorithms are managing all of us.Alex Rosenblat is a researcher at Data & Society and the author of the forthcoming book \u201cUberland: How Algorithms Are Rewriting the Rules of Work,\u201d from which this essay is adapted.Advertisement"}
