{"Headline": "What Has Actually Changed in a Year", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementIt\u2019s true that sexual harassment and assault are against the law, but again and again the law alone has not been enough to protect women. Criminal cases are notoriously difficult to bring, and civil rights laws are filled with loopholes. Many states are changing and expanding their laws, searching for a better solution.Advocates say that while the laws are still lacking, and do not yet cover the country, this is remarkable progress. We compiled a list of notable highlights from the past year.\u201cAll of the H.R. profession has had to engage in some serious introspection,\u201d said Johnny C. Taylor Jr., the president of the Society for Human Resource Management. Companies have seen that they, too, need to make changes.Beyond the entertainment industry, low-wage workers are seeing some changes, too. Buoyed by the momentum of the #MeToo movement and building on years of independent organizing, activists have successfully raised the \u201ctipped minimum wage\u201d, the pay that servers and bartenders are paid before tips, in some places, and won safer conditions for hotel and domestic workers. The continued momentum is palpable: Last month, workers across the country protested sexual harassment at McDonald\u2019s by going on strike for a day.Perhaps more than any new policy or law, the past year has been defined by a parade of once-powerful men resigning or being fired for sexual misconduct. In some cases, women are taking their place.So over the past year, men have fallen, corporations have changed their contracts, and some states have expanded their laws. But of course, there\u2019s a long way to go.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Barry Jenkins\u2019s Films of Love, Pain and Black Male Vulnerability", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "The \u201cMoonlight\u201d director brings his intuitive approach to an adaptation of James Baldwin\u2019s \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk.\u201d\u201cI want the music to hit exactly where it hit before, you know?\u201d He waited for a response. \u201cYou know what I mean, Joi?\u201dJoi McMillon laughed, and kept her back to Jenkins as she clicked through the file. She is the first African-American woman to have been nominated for the Academy Award for film editing, for her work on Jenkins\u2019s \u201cMoonlight.\u201d They have known each other since their college days, in the film program at Florida State University. \u201cYessir,\u201d she said. \u201cIt definitely will hit where it was before.\u201dThe room was too warm, and just as I thought this, the ceiling vent belched out even warmer air. Male voices down the hall discussed character motivation in some other project. McMillon made the change to the music and played the pass for Jenkins again. The penultimate scene of his film.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like ... ,\u201d Jenkins began. \u201cNot like jazz, because it\u2019s clich\u00e9d to say. But yeah, sometimes one movement needs to de-escalate before the next movement can escalate. This is the place where I feel it. It just sucks, because making this choice at this moment means that when we screen in Toronto we won\u2019t have this adjustment in it.\u201d It was the first Wednesday in September, and the Toronto International Film Festival was only four days away. The film, \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk,\u201d would have its premiere there without these 16 seconds, though it\u2019s hard to say if anyone not named Barry Jenkins would have noticed.This was my second meeting with Jenkins, and \u2014 more than during the first \u2014 his demeanor seemed bifurcated, one foot still in the shaping of the work, the other stepping into the role of a presenter, devising talking points that would carry him from Toronto through the film\u2019s limited release on Nov. 30, perhaps into the awards season beyond. \u201cI learned the hard way on \u2018Moonlight\u2019 that it\u2019s best to be at the forefront of the conversation,\u201d he told me that morning. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like tennis, you know? You want to be leading, and not playing off the back foot.\u201d Still, he was eager to show me outtakes, moments that might have been. He spoke of the film as if it possessed an immune system, one with a long list of irritants it couldn\u2019t abide. \u201cThe film rejected it,\u201d he said wistfully of one deleted scene.A work of cinema, like a novel, is a collage. The finished product is a result of hundreds of moments of cut and paste: this take moved and placed next to another one, this voice recorded to change the feel of a scene shot with no voice-over in mind. A shift to the arrangement or size of one small piece can make the whole collage feel unstable, particularly to the collagist. Each time McMillon played the pass again, the score, composed by Nicholas Britell, swelled up and embraced us before shrinking away on command. The scene \u2014 on its own, compellingly composed \u2014 slid closer to rapturous with the addition of music. A novelist would kill for such a tool.\u201cWhat do you notice about that sequence?\u201d Jenkins asked me. I\u2019d watched it several times at this point, but I wasn\u2019t sure what in particular I was supposed to notice. \u201cO.K.,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll call it. That\u2019s me imitating Baldwin. The voice-over, that\u2019s the one bit of voice-over not taken from the book.\u201dJenkins\u2019s apartment, with its wall-length windows, film-related art and preponderance of books, seems an apt place to house this small part of Baldwin\u2019s literary footprint. In his living room I spotted Marilynne Robinson\u2019s \u201cGilead\u201d (\u201cI\u2019ve read it at least six times\u201d), Vladimir Nabokov\u2019s \u201cPale Fire\u201d and, of course, plenty of books by Baldwin himself. On the cement floor \u2014 under a bookshelf, behind a vintage cream couch \u2014 I spotted Jenkins\u2019s Oscar for best adapted screenplay. Jenkins saw me looking and said he was working on a better spot for it. But he did have the envelope revealing the best-picture win for \u201cMoonlight\u201d framed and hung on the wall, alongside a congratulatory note from Warren Beatty \u2014 one of the presenters who mistakenly announced that \u201cLa La Land\u201d had won \u2014 telling him the honor was \u201cmuch deserved.\u201d After the ensuing hubbub subsided, Jenkins went to M\u00e9rida, Mexico, for a few days to clear his mind. \u201cMy favorite thing to do is to sit in the window, the front window of a cafe looking out at the sidewalk,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich is the worst thing to do, or at least in the immediate aftermath of what happened.\u201dIn addition to this new film\u2019s being the much-anticipated follow-up to \u201cMoonlight,\u201d it is also the first big-screen English-language film adaptation of a novel by Baldwin, a writer whose works are closely guarded by his estate. Much of the country, owing to our current political reality and Raoul Peck\u2019s 2016 documentary, \u201cI Am Not Your Negro,\u201d has recently become better acquainted with a truth black readers grasped long ago: James Baldwin was right about everything. Jenkins began his adaptation of Baldwin\u2019s fifth novel back in 2013, writing a faithful screen version of the 1974 book, in which a pregnant 19-year-old woman named Tish works, alongside her family, to prove the innocence of her child\u2019s jailed father, a young sculptor. This being Baldwin, of course, there\u2019s more to it: a meditation on the radical implications of declaring yourself an artist while black, on what it means to be poor in New York, on the power and limitations of romantic and filial love.According to Jenkins, this would be the first of his feature films to directly grapple with political themes, but I begged to differ, bringing up the role that gentrification played in his first feature, the 2008 morning-after romance \u201cMedicine for Melancholy\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s set in San Francisco, and the two leads even stumble onto a round-table discussion of rising housing prices. In \u201cMoonlight\u201d the ravages of the war on drugs and the brutality of poverty are not at all apolitical. True, Jenkins said, but with that film, \u201cthe whole movie is created to almost force the audience to confront what this character is feeling. And so it\u2019s really easy to sit outside the film and just want to hug the film, to hug the main character. But this is Baldwin. In Baldwin, everyone\u2019s implicated, including himself. So I think there\u2019s not a passive path through this film.\u201d It didn\u2019t appear to bother Jenkins that this might make it harder for some \u201cMoonlight\u201d devotees to stay along for the ride to \u201cBeale Street.\u201d There were still plenty of reasons to want to hug this film too.Barry Jenkins is 38, under six feet tall and solidly built, with a curated nerdiness: translucent glasses, brightly printed oxford shirts, slip-on sneakers, a canvas tote bag. He is willfully kind, and has a plethora of ways to put others at ease. He might call you \u201cbruh\u201d or \u201cboss\u201d or \u201cmy dear\u201d or \u201cboss lady,\u201d though when adamant he\u2019s apt to call anyone, regardless of gender, \u201cman.\u201d When he listens to you speak, he lets you know he\u2019s there via a steady cadence of mm-hmms, about 10 per minute, sometimes more. He has the sort of smile that if glimpsed across the room at a cocktail party might compel you to walk over and stand near him. \u201cI will not annoy, rebuff or humiliate you,\u201d this smile says.\u201cOne of the things he says to me a lot is, you know, \u2018flies with honey,\u2019\u2009\u201d his producer, Adele Romanski, another former film-school classmate, told me. \u201cI think that\u2019s a life philosophy that he extends to the work.\u201d This is a useful stance if you are interested in getting actors to open up, to bare themselves. The stereotype of the American director-auteur may be of the demanding genius who bullies his actors into transcendent performances, but Jenkins prefers a nurturing approach: \u201cI try to find a language that the actor can participate in,\u201d he says. \u201cThere has to be a language for every single person on set.\u201d These efforts translate onto the screen. But what exactly is it that\u2019s being translated?It begins with vulnerability. I\u2019ve spent my life loving black men, and I understand black masculinity to be malleable, its fabled rigidity overblown. After work, in the dark, I\u2019ve heard whispered secrets, the wanderings of restless minds. And yet all of my moviegoing life I\u2019d never seen this quotidian vulnerability so accurately rendered in film \u2014 not without a wink, a glance away, some posturing that distances \u2014 until I saw Jenkins\u2019s \u201cMoonlight.\u201d An adult son tries to keep emotional distance from his mother, a recovering crack-cocaine addict, and cannot; tears stream down his face instead. A drug dealer confirms his profession to a boy (the same son, but younger), thereby admitting to playing a part in what holds the mother captive; the boy leaves, and the drug dealer (a father figure, not a monster) stares straight ahead, defeated. In \u201cBeale Street,\u201d we watch the main character, Fonny, listen to his friend Daniel describe the psychological horror of prison. Daniel begins the conversation nonchalant, swigging a beer, and ends it with his shoulders stooped forward, the light drained from his eyes. His honesty and helpless frustration is so familiar from my actual life that it is nearly too much to bear \u2014 a perfect moment of cinema.I asked Jenkins about his ability to capture a rarely depicted kind of black male vulnerability as he drove us down Vermont Avenue in his white Toyota Prius. He said nothing for a while, a first in our hours of conversation. A chopped-and-screwed version of Solange\u2019s \u201cA Seat at the Table\u201d drifted from the speakers. \u201cI will say that\u2019s not a goal, but I would hope that\u2019s true,\u201d he said finally. \u201cI think I know what you\u2019re talking about, especially these last two films.\u201dJenkins is open, specific and effusive when talking about craft, narrative, culture, sports or politics. Less so when discussing himself. He tends to speak in long bursts, turning an idea around out loud before hitting on the declarative statement he likes. He started talking about his work adapting \u201cIn Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,\u201d the autobiographical script by Tarell Alvin McCraney that became his breakthrough feature. The story had uncanny overlaps with Jenkins\u2019s own biography: an addicted mother, an upbringing in the same Miami ghetto, subjects Jenkins would not have been comfortable exploring without McCraney\u2019s words as an intermediary. \u201cI can take Tarell\u2019s experience,\u201d Jenkins said, \u201cwhich is much more open than mine, and I can sew cinematic storytelling into it.\u201d McCraney, whose gay coming-of-age story informs the plot of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d describes Jenkins, who has a girlfriend, as approaching emotionality with something akin to a queer imagination: \u201cI think he has moments where his imagination is not normative. Just look at his work and see. Where there should be broad strokes there are polka dots.\u201d\u201cBarry loves love,\u201d Romanski says. \u201cIf you look at his work, there are three different types of love stories from \u2018Medicine\u2019 to \u2018Moonlight\u2019 to \u2018Beale,\u2019 but they\u2019re all love stories.\u201d Love, yes, but also pain. Nat Sanders, who edited both \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cBeale Street\u201d with McMillon, says there\u2019s \u201ca duality\u201d to Jenkins: \u201cAny time he wants to, he\u2019s so charismatic and exuberant. When I do a pass of a scene that really excites him, you get the best reaction you could ever hope to get. He\u2019ll do airplanes around the room and jump up and down, yell \u2018Bruh! Bruh!\u2019 and it\u2019s the best. But also, he\u2019s very private and very quiet.\u201d In \u201cChlorophyl,\u201d a short film Jenkins directed in 2011, working without a formal script, the main character, played by Ana Laura Trevi\u00f1o, reads a James Baldwin quote, translating into Spanish: \u201cLove does not begin and end the way we seem to think it does. Love is a battle, love is a war; love is a growing up.\u201d In a moment of improvisation, Jenkins had handed her his leather cellphone case, on which he\u2019d paid to have these words embossed.Although he values romance in film, Jenkins is hesitant to say he places as much importance on romantic love in his own life. \u201cI\u2019ve allowed myself to experience growth in love once in my life, but it was so long ago,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve become accustomed to being alone, or if because of the way I grew up I became conditioned to being alone. But I guess my identity has been formed around being alone.\u201dWe were back downtown now, in the Arts District, pulling up to a bookstore on the hunt for a novel I\u2019d recommended to him. It turned out that this one, the second of three we\u2019d try, did not sell fiction. Jenkins did a lap anyway, searching for a book of photography by Roy DeCarava, whose iconic images of midcentury Harlem served as a visual reference for \u201cBeale Street\u201d and appear at the beginning and end of the film. On our way back to the car, we passed a boutique where Jenkins stopped to inquire after the owner: Had she had her baby yet? She had. Jenkins conveyed his congratulations. For a man who considers being alone a comfortable mode of existence, he makes reaching out to others look easy.He grew up in Knight Manor (also known as the Village), a housing project built close to the larger Liberty Square projects. His mother was addicted to crack, a fact that Jenkins is both open about and firm in not expounding upon. When \u201cMoonlight\u201d had its premiere, he told me, \u201cWe rented a theater just for her to go see the film, and on the day of, she decided she could not see it. Probably my fault. I should have flown back.\u201d Something previously open about Jenkins\u2019s posture \u2014 the set of his shoulders, the steadiness of his gaze \u2014 closed off as he told me this. Later, he says, his mother happened upon a bootleg copy of the film at a corner store; she bought it and watched at home. \u201cWhat I see in that,\u201d Jenkins says, \u201cis she just wanted to watch it by herself in an environment she could control. She actually complimented Naomie\u2019s performance\u201d \u2014 Naomie Harris, who plays the main character\u2019s troubled mother. \u201cSay of that what you will.\u201dKnight Manor was torn down, and a new campus for Miami Northwestern high school built on top of it. Jenkins would attend classes there, preparing for the future atop his own demolished childhood home \u2014 though he doesn\u2019t recall giving this symbolism much thought. Of his home life during these years he reveals little, though he alludes to it often. \u201cI grew up in a certain kind of way,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a crutch. I started therapy, I stopped. I should start it again. It\u2019s a crutch.\u201d His reluctance to explain further may also reflect his general disinterest in creating a public persona, and in the self-mythologizing that goes with it. \u201cIt was what was so difficult about everything that happened with \u2018Moonlight,\u2019\u2009\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not smart enough to say as much as I have to say about the film without revealing things about myself. But that\u2019s the last thing I ever want to do.\u201dIn high school Jenkins played football, got good grades, made it to senior year. He had been admitted to the University of Florida, but after a trip to visit F.S.U. in Tallahassee, \u201cI thought: This is the blackest place in America. I gotta be here.\u201d In Tallahassee, he lived with high school friends and intended to pursue a creative-writing degree \u2014 he used to be obsessed with the Iowa Writers\u2019 Workshop \u2014 until one day he walked by a sign for the film school and had a change of heart. He began pursuing a dual degree. \u201cI remember my first short film,\u201d he says. \u201cI put my roommate in it, and it was a strange film. We shot it on a Bolex\u201d \u2014 a spring-wound camera associated with avant-garde film \u2014 \u201cso it wasn\u2019t like a narrative. It was more experimental.\u201d His roommates, he says, \u201cjust looked at me like they thought I had lost my mind.\u201d In the film department, though, Jenkins began making connections with the collaborators he\u2019d work with over the next two decades: McMillon and Sanders; James Laxton, the cinematographer for all his feature-length films; and Romanski and Mark Ceryak, two of his partners at the production company Pastel.After watching other students\u2019 work, Jenkins didn\u2019t think he had the technical ability to compete. \u201cDigital filmmaking wasn\u2019t anywhere near what it is now,\u201d he says; working on film, \u201cyou couldn\u2019t see what you were doing. There\u2019s no playback on set. You can\u2019t shoot it and then immediately pull it up on the memory card.\u201d The filmmaker needed solid knowledge from the start. Jenkins took a year away from the film program to study the craft on his own, finishing his creative-writing credits in the meantime. He moved in with Laxton. The popular directors to emulate in their program were those who made big-budget, Spielbergian features. Jenkins watched foreign art-house cinema in hopes of finding an alternative aesthetic approach. \u201cI remember we\u2019d have running DVDs playing in the background,\u201d Laxton told me. \u201cAnd as people would come in and out the house, we\u2019d kind of sit down and talk about it.\u201d Before that year, Jenkins would have named \u201cDie Hard\u201d as his favorite film. After, it was the Hong Kong filmmaker Wong Kar-wai\u2019s stylized, lovesick \u201cChungking Express.\u201dWhen Jenkins returned to the program he wrote and directed the short film \u201cMy Josephine,\u201d a mostly subtitled account of an Arab immigrant couple who own a laundromat and wash American flags for free after the Sept. 11 attacks. Over wine at a bar near his apartment, Jenkins recalled making it: \u201cThat\u2019s me as a dude who grew up in the hood!\u201d he said, his face alight once again. \u201cThat\u2019s not me now, 20 years removed from the hood. That\u2019s me, you know what I mean? And it\u2019s taking my experience of being somebody from the hood who now is a fish out of water in this academic setting, in this film consortium, taking that feeling and putting it into these things. It was empowering.\u201dAfter graduation, the director Darnell Martin gave Jenkins his first film job, as her assistant on the set of the TV movie \u201cTheir Eyes Were Watching God.\u201d His work on \u201cMy Josephine,\u201d she told me, had \u201cso much poetry in it. Visually it was really stunning.\u201d Here was an avenue through which Jenkins could grapple with feelings he otherwise preferred to leave unexamined. \u201cI think when I found film,\u201d he said, \u201cI found a way \u2014 I still hide a bit \u2014 but a way to not hide as much. I felt like I could put these things into the work because it\u2019s the movie. It\u2019s not me.\u201dOn a very hot August day, Jenkins sat in a color-grading studio in Greenwich Village with Laxton and the colorist Alex Bickel. The big screen at the other end of the room showed a scene at Showmans Jazz Club in Harlem. The characters Joseph and Frank, played by the veteran actors Colman Domingo and Michael Beach, sat at the far end of the bar. The room was realistically smoke-filled for the early \u201970s, but too smoky for the purposes of the film. Jenkins and Laxton took turns guiding Bickel on how to fix the problem. They moved on to a close-up of Beach\u2019s face, its topography made more intense by his look of dejection. Jenkins made a noise of approval. \u201cIt was like Take 3 of the zoom,\u201d he said, \u201cand he just locked in.\u201dJenkins enjoys moments when his actors make direct eye contact with the camera. He and Laxton are in agreement on the power of this sustained looking, how holding the camera on an actor can bring out a host of emotions in the viewer. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a dark theater with 300 people sitting next to you,\u201d Laxton said, \u201cand you have someone looking at you from a big screen, I think it does something to you as an audience member.\u201d Alfred Hitchcock employed these sorts of shots, as did Jonathan Demme (who can forget Hannibal Lecter\u2019s stare?), but unlike those filmmakers, Jenkins and Laxton rarely shoot theirs during moments of great emotional agitation. Instead they catch their characters at ease, quiet. \u201cBarry captures silence in a way that we don\u2019t see much, and we especially don\u2019t see that much in the African-American film experience,\u201d Mahershala Ali, who won a best-supporting-actor Oscar for playing the drug-dealer-cum-father-figure in \u201cMoonlight,\u201d told me. \u201cYou usually don\u2019t see black people holding peace and occupying silence, having to fill those voids in that way.\u201dJenkins shoots these moments intuitively, waiting until he feels something. \u201cI\u2019m not directing them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are just giving me this thing. And sometimes you can look at an actor and see, Oh, there\u2019s the soul.\u201d And if they\u2019re comfortable enough, he says, they can look directly into the camera without losing that soul. \u201cInstead they\u2019re going to give it to the audience.\u201d KiKi Layne, whose starring role as Tish in \u201cBeale Street\u201d marks her first foray into film from theater, described it as looking into a black hole: \u201cI think at one point I told him that \u2018Man, this feels so strange\u2019 and he was like, \u2018I know, but I need it, I need it.\u2019\u2009\u201d The actors don\u2019t know where these shots will wind up in the film, and neither, necessarily, does Jenkins, at the time. Later, though, the emotions viewers read on the actors\u2019 faces \u2014 a close-up of Fonny near the end of the film goes from anxious and unsure to settled \u2014 feel made for the precise moment when they appear on screen.These looks don\u2019t quite break the fourth wall, because the actors are not regarding the audience. In \u201cBeale Street,\u201d they\u2019re most often gazing at someone they love. For nonblack audience members, it might be the first time they\u2019ve had a black person direct such a gaze their way; Jenkins offers a glimpse at a world previously hidden to them. For a black viewer, there\u2019s more likely a kind of recognition: I know that face, although I have never seen this actor before. Or, if the actor is one you\u2019re familiar with, it can go the opposite direction, letting you see the person anew. Regina King, who plays Tish\u2019s mother in the film, has played a mother or wife as many times as I have fingers, over decades. But who was this woman on the screen, staring at her reflection in a mirror, summoning her courage, while also staring at me? Typecasting actors isn\u2019t simply about having them play a role they have played before; it\u2019s about locking them into the same aesthetic representation of that role. \u201cHe knows that it\u2019s not just his film,\u201d King told me. \u201cHe can\u2019t do this without the talent of other people, and he allows those talents to shine.\u201dDuring the festival season leading up to the theatrical release of \u201cMoonlight,\u201d Jenkins directed an episode of the first season of the Netflix series \u201cDear White People,\u201d revolving around an actor named Marque Richardson; his character has a gun pulled on him by campus police officers, and by the episode\u2019s end he breaks down, crying. I have personally known Marque Richardson for 15 years and have watched him act in all sorts of roles. This episode was the first time he ever felt a stranger to me on screen.This level of artistic freedom is hard to come by in the world of Hollywood-financed film, he thinks, but the possibility of leading such a life \u2014 not feeling obligated to have one foot planted in the role of presenter \u2014 captivates him. He could also see himself teaching film to others in 15 years. In the short term, though, he is working on a forthcoming limited-series adaptation of Colson Whitehead\u2019s \u201cThe Underground Railroad\u201d for Amazon, and a screenplay based on the life of the gold-medal-winning boxer Claressa Shields. \u201cI wish I had taken a break after the Oscars and all that stuff, but I just went right into this movie, and right into the writers\u2019 room for \u2018The Underground Railroad.\u2019 I didn\u2019t really process all that stuff. And now this movie is finally ending, and I think it\u2019s time for a moment to process.\u201dIt was our last few minutes together, and I wanted to know \u2014 having heard him speak of a more unfettered artistic life, and witnessing him bring happiness to others with such ease \u2014 what exactly made him happy. \u201cI\u2019m never happy, man \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s just the case,\u201d he said. He used to think he didn\u2019t deserve to be. Then: \u201cI think making other people happy makes me happy.\u201d He recalled helping Alex Hibbert, who plays the child version of the main character in \u201cMoonlight,\u201d find his footing as an actor. \u201cWhen other people do things on my sets that either they didn\u2019t believe they could do, or understand they could do, or that surprises them?\u201d That, he said, was amazing. It was a matter of helping them tap into the ineffable. \u201cWhat I say to the actors, if they ask, is that it\u2019s not about a certain meaning; it\u2019s definitely about a certain feeling. How can we work together to create this feeling, even if the feeling is not knowable?\u201cI really want that simple life, you know?\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why I fell in love with this book.\u201d He quoted the moment in Baldwin\u2019s novel when Fonny, the young sculptor jailed for a crime he swears he didn\u2019t commit, says he only needs art and the love of his woman to survive: \u201c\u2009\u2018I got two things in my life, man \u2014 I got my wood and stone, and I got Tish.\u2019\u2009\u201d Despite the increasing complexity that comes with a successful Hollywood career, Jenkins desires the same. \u201cI have my wood and stone now,\u201d he said.Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Bodyguard\u2019 on Netflix, Britain\u2019s Biggest TV Hit in Years", "Date": "2018-10-23", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe British writer Jed Mercurio builds television shows the way the Cenobites build puzzle boxes in the \u201cHellraiser\u201d movies. Get too close to one, and its intricate mechanism shoots its hooks into you, pulling you through a portal into a gyre of suspense from which there\u2019s no escape.Mercurio\u2019s most successful medium is a mash-up of the police procedural and the political conspiracy thriller, and his storytelling trademarks include severe psychological duress, inappropriate sex among public servants and the ease with which major characters are killed off. Most noticeably, he strives to keep every conspiratorial option open and every possible suspect in play for as long as possible. There are definite heroes and villains, but you might not know which is which until just before the final credits.\u201cBodyguard\u201d stars Richard Madden, who played the sad, short-lived Robb Stark on \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d as David Budd, a war veteran now serving in a police unit that provides protection details. A long, tense, highly effective opening scene involving a suicide bomber on a train establishes Budd\u2019s bona fides \u2014 he\u2019s capable and compassionate in a crisis, but he\u2019s got a twitch, a crack in his armor presumably caused by post-traumatic stress and associated problems with his marriage.The hawkish, ruthlessly ambitious Montague is a target, or perhaps the target is Budd, or someone else, but in any case the threat levels are through the roof. There are bomb vests, truck bombs, regular bombs and a conspiratorial stew pitting the police, the security services and the government against one another, and all against Budd.As in \u201cLine of Duty,\u201d which follows a police internal-affairs unit, Mercurio is concerned with the revelation of character under pressure. But in \u201cBodyguard\u201d he hasn\u2019t done the work of building a credible character before putting it through the wringer. Budd is hazily sketched, and the extreme measures the story takes to extend its mystery and keep his motives in question have the effect of making it hard to really care about him until the season is almost up.Stuck with this cipher of a role \u2014 he\u2019s stress personified \u2014 Madden gives a performance that\u2019s alternately robotic and slightly unhinged. Unlike Martin Compston, who plays a comparable character in \u201cLine of Duty,\u201d or Lennie James, who was excellent as the villain in that show\u2019s first season, Madden doesn\u2019t do enough to distract us when Mercurio\u2019s plot twists veer from reality or his characters refuse to act like rational humans.In \u201cBodyguard,\u201d Mercurio\u2019s breakneck story feels, at every moment, both carefully constructed and made up on the spot. It\u2019s difficult to go into any further detail because the constant revelations and reversals make the show an all-spoilers affair.It can also be a blast, if you\u2019re all about the mystery and the forward momentum and your requirements for plausibility and psychological realism aren\u2019t high. Whether American viewers will be sucked in the way British viewers were is a question that won\u2019t get a definitive answer, since Netflix releases no numbers. British shows that hit it big in America tend to be raucous comedies (\u201cAbsolutely Fabulous\u201d), genteel soap operas (\u201cDownton Abbey\u201d) or historical re-enactments (\u201cThe Crown\u201d), not thrillers. But maybe Mercurio\u2019s puzzle box can buck the trend.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Peter Rice, Fox\u2019s Un-Hollywood TV Boss, Is Getting More Say Over What You Watch", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHollywoodPeter Rice, who was named the chairman of Walt Disney Television on Monday, avoids that kind of showboating.Mr. Rice, 51, became the president of 21st Century Fox a little more than a year ago, after working at various Fox divisions for nearly three decades. He might have stayed indefinitely, if it were not for the Walt Disney Company\u2019s surprise acquisition of the majority of the Rupert Murdoch-owned company, a deal that shareholders approved over the summer.When regulators sign off on the $71.3 billion transaction, expected in the next few months, Mr. Rice will take charge of the combined television assets of two companies that were immense even before they merged. Although he will become perhaps the most powerful executive in the industry \u2014 he will oversee a broadcast network, a collection of cable channels and an enormous studio \u2014 his understated demeanor is unlikely to change.Associates described him as \u201ceven-tempered,\u201d \u201caffable\u201d and \u201ccryptic.\u201d During work meetings, he favors the Socratic method, and he is not afraid of silence, often allowing long pauses that some lieutenants describe as intimidating and intentional.He seems most at ease when he is marking up the erasable whiteboard walls that line his office, or spending time with his wife and children at their home in Hidden Hills, a gated suburb in the far reaches of the San Fernando Valley.Disney\u2019s announcement of Mr. Rice\u2019s new job specified that he will report directly to Robert A. Iger, Disney\u2019s chief executive. For the first time in his career, Mr. Rice\u2019s boss will be someone other than a Murdoch.The appointment also means his name is very likely to be bandied about in one of Hollywood\u2019s favorite parlor games: Who will run the Magic Kingdom when Mr. Iger\u2019s contract comes to an end in three years?The job won\u2019t be easy. Mr. Rice will be responsible for the countless hours of television content filling the schedules of the broadcast and cable networks that have long been in the Disney family, as well as the various Fox channels that were already part of his purview.That means ABC, Fox, Freeform, Disney Channel, Disney Junior, Disney XD, Freeform, the National Geographic Channel and FX, not to mention the two companies\u2019 combined TV studios, leaving Mr. Rice in charge of an exceedingly wide range of fare \u2014 everything from \u201cAtlanta\u201d to \u201cPuppy Dog Pals.\u201dHis brief will include fixing ABC, which has consistently finished in last place among the four broadcast networks, and improving the fortunes of the sagging Disney Channel.Disney is also counting on Mr. Rice and his team to find shows that will attract subscribers to Hulu \u2014 Disney will be the majority owner when the deal is official \u2014 and a new streaming service scheduled to go live next year.While Disney has signaled that it will welcome the programs it is to inherit as part of its purchase of Fox, something like the FX series \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d \u2014 which marketed its new season with a grotesque image of a devil\u2019s hand reaching for a baby \u2014 may be a tricky fit for the family-friendly empire. This is a company, after all, that uses songs like \u201cUnder the Sea\u201d from \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d as the hold music on its telephone system.Tom Rothman, a former Fox executive who runs Sony\u2019s Motion Picture Group, said he believed Mr. Rice is up for the challenge.\u201cPeter can do that nearly impossible thing, which is to mix genuine creative vision with business acumen,\u201d Mr. Rothman said. \u201cEvery significant decision in these senior jobs involves both of those skills, and that kind of integrated intelligence is really rare.\u201dMr. Rice, who has seldom granted interviews, declined to comment for this article.Many of his colleagues have noted his easy rapport with the Murdochs. And a family connection is what led to him to Fox.\u201cThe boss had a huge admiration for Peter\u2019s dad,\u201d said David Hill, a former top Fox Sports executive. He added that Rupert Murdoch \u201cloves thoroughbreds, and obviously understands blood lines.\u201dMr. Rice\u2019s father, Tom Rice, was an official with the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union, which cooperated with Mr. Murdoch in 1986 as he defied organized labor during his ultimately successful efforts to move the printing and publishing operations of his News International company from Fleet Street to London\u2019s Wapping district.While his father worked for Mr. Murdoch in Dublin, Mr. Rice was on the rise in the mogul\u2019s Los Angeles operation, helping to reel in talented up-and-comers like the director Baz Luhrmann. In 2000, Fox named Mr. Rice the president of its specialty film division, Fox Searchlight.He turned the unit into an Oscar and box-office superpower, delivering one idiosyncratic hit after another, most made for budgets of under $15 million \u2014 an achievement that remains his biggest. The movies released during his Fox Searchlight tenure included \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d \u201cNapoleon Dynamite,\u201d \u201cSideways,\u201d \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d \u201cThe Last King of Scotland,\u201d \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201cJuno.\u201d\u201cHis support can feel like prevailing winds in your sails,\u201d said Jason Reitman, who directed \u201cJuno,\u201d which took in $231 million worldwide in 2007 and was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning one for Diablo Cody\u2019s screenplay. \u201cI\u2019ve never had an unthoughtful conversation with him.\u201dFor much of the last decade, Mr. Rice has been in charge of the company\u2019s TV assets, not including Fox News. He increased the budget for FX, and it attracted top creators like Donald Glover (\u201cAtlanta\u201d). At the same time, the Fox TV studio created hits for Fox channels and other networks, including \u201cThe Americans\u201d (FX), \u201cEmpire\u201d (Fox), \u201cThis Is Us\u201d (NBC), \u201cModern Family\u201d (ABC) and \u201cHomeland\u201d (Showtime).\u201cHe starts off at 20th Century Fox as a cadet and he just gets bigger and bigger,\u201d said Mr. Hill, the former Fox executive, who credited Mr. Rice for having a deft touch with actors, producers and directors, as well as a \u201ctotal understanding of the underpinning revenue.\u201dAnother mark against him is that the Fox broadcast network has had trouble finding sustainable hits in recent years.What Mr. Rice did not know at the time was that Mr. Murdoch and his sons, Lachlan and James, had already entered into talks with Disney.Taking his overall record into account, his next employer is betting that Mr. Rice\u2019s approach to television has a better chance at success than the plan Disney had in place before it agreed to buy Fox.Mr. Rice will not be going it alone on his journey from Fox to Disney: Accompanying him will be John Landgraf, the head of FX; Dana Walden, the co-chief executive of the Fox television group; and Gary E. Knell, the head of National Geographic Partners.Disney is counting on Team Rice to deliver hits at a time when the competition has never been greater, particularly in children\u2019s television, now that Netflix has become a major draw for young viewers.Navigating Disney\u2019s buttoned-up culture may be a challenge for some Fox alumni, who will leave behind the less structured working environment fostered by Mr. Murdoch. But Mr. Rice\u2019s general bearing \u2014 keep your head down and your ego in check \u2014 is probably a good fit for an organization that values executives who do not carry themselves as if they are bigger than the company they work for.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "This Little Girl\u2019s Seizures Won\u2019t Stop. Her Parents Need Your Advice.", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "Help Dr. Lisa Sanders get to the bottom of unsolved medical mysteries.\u201cSadie is acting strange, kind of out of it.\u201d Over the phone, her husband\u2019s voice sounded strained as he spoke about their 6-year-old daughter. The girl\u2019s mother, Sara, was walking home from an errand in their Queens, N.Y., neighborhood. \u201cStrange in what way,\u201d she asked. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cYou have to come home and see this.\u201d Sara hurried the last few blocks, and when she entered the apartment, she could see her daughter sitting on the sofa. \u201cSadie,\u201d she called. Her daughter turned her head to face her mother but didn\u2019t seem to see her. It was as if she looked straight through her. Sara immediately called 911. As they waited for the ambulance, the mother couldn\u2019t take her eyes off Sadie. She was awake, but not really there.Suddenly the girl\u2019s lip twitched. Just one side, the left side, pulled up then relaxed in a failed half smile. Over and over. Her head began to jerk to the left, repeatedly. Sara had never seen anything like it. When the emergency medical technicians arrived, they took one look at the little girl and told the parents she was having a seizure. The mother rode in the ambulance with her child to the closest hospital, Elmhurst Hospital Center. The girl\u2019s father stayed behind to arrange care for their 4-year-old daughter, before joining his wife.As soon as mother and child arrived in the E.R., Sadie was given Ativan, a fast-acting sedative that is the drug of choice in treating ongoing seizures. While she was asleep, she was taken for a CT scan. When there was a question of a possible clot in the brain, she was taken for a second CT with contrast to better define the blood vessels. This second scan was completely normal. So why had she had this odd-looking seizure? The doctors in the E.R. weren\u2019t sure. While there the child spiked a temperature to 101, and a blood test showed an elevated white-blood-cell count. Could it be some kind of infection? Or did she have a brain tumor or some structural brain abnormality? Those can\u2019t always be seen in a CT scan and are common causes of seizures in a child. She would need to be admitted to the hospital in order to figure this out, the child\u2019s mother was told. You can see the notes from Elmhurst below.Sara had a cousin who was an adult neurologist at Columbia Medical Center, so the decision was made to move the child there. The cousin wouldn\u2019t be directly involved in the child\u2019s care, but it was reassuring to have family around. The E.R. doctors dosed the child with Keppra, a widely used antiseizure medication, and sent her to the Upper Manhattan hospital.After Sadie woke from the medications she\u2019d been given, she seemed her usual happy, active self. She moved and spoke a little slower than normal, but her mother attributed that to the powerful antiseizure medications she was given. She had an M.R.I., which was normal. The girl\u2019s parents found that reassuring. You can see that report below. Maybe she\u2019d just had a single seizure triggered by the fever she had? They had read that fever could be a common cause of seizures in a child.\u2193Dr. Tristan Sands, a pediatric epilepsy specialist, was not reassured by the M.R.I. The day after her arrival, before the M.R.I. was done, the child had continued EEG monitoring accompanied by video, and that test \u2014 to Sands, the more important of the two \u2014 was markedly abnormal. It showed that the activity on the right side of the child\u2019s brain, in the frontal lobe, was abnormally slow. In addition, the tracing showed several episodes of the spiking rhythmic waves that indicated a seizure. The parents had not seen any evidence of a seizure since they had been there, and reviewing video of the child done at the time, neither could Sands, and yet he was certain the seizures were real.After the seizures were noted, Sadie was given more Ativan, and her dose of Keppra was increased. The seizures stopped \u2014 but only for 12 hours. That night the EEG showed that she had more seizures as she slept. The following day was just as abnormal. The electrical activity on the right side of her brain (which controls movement on the left side of the body) was slow compared with the normal-looking left side of the brain. The waves were interrupted with eight brief episodes of the electrical storm indicating a seizure over the seven hours between early morning and lunchtime. Again, looking at the child, there was no evidence that she was having a seizure. The doses of her antiseizure medications were increased again, but overnight she had 16 more seizures between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. All the erratic signals came from the same part of her brain \u2014 the front of the right half of her brain. When larger doses of Keppra didn\u2019t stop the seizures, the doctors added a third medication, Trileptal. With the addition of this new medication, the seizures finally became less frequent.Sands was struck by the abnormality of the child\u2019s brain as seen by EEG and the lively normalcy of the child herself. It wasn\u2019t unusual to have what\u2019s known as subclinical seizures \u2014 those that register on an EEG but don\u2019t show up in the patient\u2019s behavior \u2014 especially with the kinds of seizures she was having, those that come from a single region in the brain and don\u2019t spread. What was unusual, however, was to see this kind of wildly aberrant EEG in someone who was also experiencing intermittent and focal seizures that were so low-powered that they didn\u2019t change the child\u2019s behavior. Sands was worried that these seizures, though local and subclinical, wouldn\u2019t stay that way. He hoped to find the right cocktail of medications that would help reduce or, ideally, prevent additional seizures. And to find out why she was having them at all.\u2193The most common cause of any kind of seizure is some abnormality in the brain itself. This can be a tumor or a stroke or something called cortical dysplasia, an abnormality in how the brain was made. M.R.I.s have made all these disorders much easier to detect. But Sadie\u2019s M.R.I. was completely normal.The little girl didn\u2019t look as if she had an infection. She hadn\u2019t had a fever since she arrived at the hospital, and a lumbar puncture \u2014 more commonly known as a spinal tap \u2014 done the day she arrived showed no signs of infection, either. The spinal fluid was also checked for signs of an autoimmune disorder. Sometimes antibodies will mistakenly start to attack a normal part of the body as if it were an infecting invader. None of the most common of these antibodies were found. A sample of her spinal fluid was sent to the Mayo Clinic to look for other, more unusual types of autoimmune disorders. Those results took a couple of weeks to come back, but when they did revealed no autoimmune causes of the seizures.Sadie was in the hospital for nearly two weeks before the team figured out a cocktail of medications to reduce the number of seizures the girl had \u2014 from the dozens per day she started with, down to one a day. Sands had hoped to stop them completely but, at this point, wasn\u2019t sure that was possible with medication alone. Sadie and her parents were thrilled by the news that she was doing well enough to go home. The little girl had seemed fine after that terrifying initial seizure. Her mom just hoped that they had figured out the problem so that Sadie could get back to school. She was a very social little girl and being stuck in the hospital or kept away from her friends was difficult for her.\u2193Two weeks after being discharged from the hospital, Sara saw Sadie have another seizure. It was brief but still scary. She and her mom were walking to the bus when suddenly Sadie stopped. She walked toward her mom but in her eyes was the same blank, unseeing stare she\u2019d had that one time before. She called her daughter\u2019s name, and again there was no response. The whole episode lasted maybe a minute, but it scared her. The mother quickly called Sands. He suggested giving an extra dose of the long-acting medication they were using instead of Ativan called Onfi. There were no more episodes of staring, but later that day, Sadie\u2019s mom thought she saw the girl\u2019s lip twitch upward twice. Other than those two brief episodes, Sadie seemed fine.She had another EEG at the end of the month. The results were upsetting. Although neither the patient nor her parents had noticed any seizure activity, other than the two brief episodes a couple of weeks earlier, this EEG seemed to indicate that her brain was having seizures almost all the time.Sands knew this was bad news. His team had been working for over a month to get Sadie\u2019s seizures under control, and they would keep trying, but they would also need to consider a different option: surgery. For patients whose seizures can\u2019t be controlled by medicines, resecting the region of the brain causing these electrical storms can be lifesaving. For Sadie\u2019s parents, brain surgery was a terrifying prospect. But so was the idea of a lifetime of uncontrollable seizures. Sands wasn\u2019t ready to take the child to the operating room yet, but he wanted to introduce the idea. Doctor and parents agreed to keep trying different combinations of medications and consider the surgical option only after they failed.The following week, the little girl went back to the hospital for another test, this one called a PET scan. This test shows where fuel is being used in the body. In Sadie\u2019s case, they would be focusing on her brain, looking for differences in the way the right and left sides of her brain were working. The harder each area of the brain worked, and the more fuel that was being used, the brighter the scan would be in those spots. It was almost not a surprise to Sadie\u2019s parents to hear that this scan was also quite abnormal.\u2193On the way home from the scan, the left side of Sadie\u2019s mouth began to jump in a strange and unnatural way. Sadie was awake and tried to speak but couldn\u2019t. Her mouth seemed to have a mind of its own. Sara pulled out her phone and filmed the strange jumping of her daughter\u2019s lips. When her mouth stopped moving, Sadie said that it felt like her tongue was bouncing inside her mouth, and there was nothing she could do about it. Over the next 24 hours, Sadie had dozens of episodes like this. Sara made a video of as many of them as she could and sent it to Sands. You can see that video below.When Sands saw the video his heart sank. He recognized this type of seizure. She was having what is known as epilepsia partialis continua, or E.P.C. These are focal seizures that affect only one part of the body. The patient is awake and aware of the seizure but has no control over it. And the movements can last for hours, days or even weeks. And after the seizure is finally over, that part of the body may be quite weak for a while \u2014 a postseizure effect called Todd\u2019s paralysis. These localized seizures are rare and usually caused by some type of inflammation in the brain. In a child like Sadie, who had a variety of different types of seizures \u2014 that were all hard to control, that came from only one side of the brain \u2014 and who developed E.P.C., an even rarer diagnosis had to be considered: Rasmussen\u2019s encephalitis.This disorder, first described in 1958, is characterized by hard-to-control seizures caused by inflammation limited to a single side of the brain. Unlike most other causes of seizures, Rasmussen\u2019s is a progressive disease and results, over the course of just a few years, in the destruction of the affected side of the brain. It is rare and, like so many of the diseases of the brain, still poorly understood. Current thinking is that it is driven by an abnormality in the immune system, and so treatment is directed at medications that suppress that system. These medications may be helpful in slowing brain destruction, but the seizures often remain uncontrolled and frequently worsen. Moreover, nearly all of those given a diagnosis of this disease end up eventually with the complete loss of the affected side of the brain, whether they take these immune-suppressing medications or not.The only treatment found to be successful in eliminating the seizures has been drastic: isolating the affected lobe by cutting the connections between the diseased part of the brain and the rest of the body. After surgery, the seizures will stop but the patient will lose the function in all the parts of the body that were controlled by that side of the brain \u2014 all movement of the body on the side controlled by the affected part of the brain: the sight in that eye, the hearing in that ear. Some function can be regained over time, with intensive physical therapy. But it is hard. It\u2019s as if you had a massive stroke, taking out the entire brain on the one side.\u2193After seeing the video, Sands called Sara and asked her to bring Sadie back to the hospital. He explained to the girl\u2019s parents that he was worried that Sadie may have this terrible disease. He proposed a biopsy. It couldn\u2019t prove that she had Rasmussen\u2019s, but it could help them make sure she didn\u2019t have a hidden infection. They agreed, and on Valentine\u2019s Day this year, the child underwent surgery to remove a bit of her brain.The biopsy results were suggestive of Rasmussen\u2019s encephalitis. You can see the pathology report below. But to make the diagnosis of Rasmussen\u2019s, there must be loss of brain tissue from the disease that is visible on imaging. And there must be a progressive loss of function. Sadie had subtle signs of weakness, but her brain looked unchanged. Sands was worried that it was only a matter of time. Still, the surgery is so devastating that the diagnosis must be absolutely certain. Based on the biopsy results and the fact that the EEGs showed worsening disease, the decision was made to start immune-suppressing therapy as a first step. Sadie was started on steroids and also given something known as intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), a collection of antibodies from hundreds of blood donors. It\u2019s not clear why this treatment works in immune system-triggered diseases, but it is frequently effective. She was also started on a third immune-suppressing treatment \u2014 a drug called Rituximab. For most children with Rasmussen\u2019s encephalitis, diagnosis can take years. For Sadie, because it was so early in the course of the disease, Sands hoped that aggressive suppression of her immune system might slow further brain destruction.With all these interventions, the mouth seizures went from dozens a day to a handful every week or so. Sara sometimes noticed jerks in Sadie\u2019s left hand, but they were few and far between. The biggest change beyond the diminished number of seizures was her weight gain. Over the course of her two months of seizures, she gained over 20 pounds. Other than that, she often seemed her old self.\u2193After three whole weeks of virtually no seizures, they started again. First the mouth seizures \u2014 they were the worst. They distorted her face and kept her from speaking. Sadie hated them. Those seizures were replaced by spasms in her left leg. At first, they were small little jerks at the ankle, but over time they became stronger, moving up the leg from the ankle, to the knee and hip. By the end of the summer, the leg jerks were strong enough to knock her over, and she walked with a visible limp.A repeated M.R.I. midsummer seemed to show evidence of brain-tissue loss. It was subtle, but it was enough for Sands. He told Sadie\u2019s parents he thought it was time to consider surgery. And it wasn\u2019t just Sands. He had presented her case to the epilepsy center at Columbia. They agreed. They felt it was clear that the child had Rasmussen\u2019s. Surgery could spare her the erratic course of the disease and give her the chance to start working on getting better. Moreover, unchecked the disease would affect not just her body, but her mind. Without treatment, children with Rasmussen\u2019s develop cognitive losses.More testing would be needed before surgery. First they would have to see where the child\u2019s language center was located. Sadie was left-handed, and while most people have their language center on the left side of the brain, left-handed patients can have the center on the right side. It would be rare, but it\u2019s something they would need to know. If either surgery or the disease itself took out her language center, she could be left unable to speak.Before they subjected their daughter to this surgery, Sara and her husband wanted to get a second opinion. Their pediatrician recommended a pediatric neurologist at N.Y.U., and they also saw a neurologist and pediatric neurosurgeon at Mount Sinai on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.At this point, Sadie has seen all the additional consultants. Sara and her husband are waiting for their official recommendations. The team at Mount Sinai also thinks Rasmussen\u2019s is the likely diagnosis. The neurosurgeon, however, notes that the recent M.R.I. doesn\u2019t show the kind of asymmetrical loss of brain tissue that is typical of the disease. The team is considering an intervention to control the child\u2019s symptoms that is less invasive than cutting away the entire right side of the brain. If this treatment doesn\u2019t work, the family could still try the surgery. Sara and her husband are unsure of what to do.So let me ask you, readers. Is this something you recognize? Is this the story of someone you know? Do you have a child who was diagnosed with Rasmussen\u2019s? What advice do you have for Sara and her husband? If you have any thoughts about Sadie\u2019s diagnosis or about the diagnosis of Rasmussen\u2019s encephalitis, please share it with us, and we will share it with Sara and her husband. Sara told me that if they do have to choose this devastating surgery for their child, they want to be as certain as they can be that it is the very best option for Sadie. Help us help them.First and last preferred, please.Thank you for your submission.Nov. 16, 2018Oct. 26, 2018Oct. 1, 2018Aug. 23, 2018July 11, 2018June 20, 2018May 21, 2018May 4, 2018April 11, 2018Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Lady Gaga Isn\u2019t Done Shape-Shifting Yet", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "Lady Gaga wants to wear every costume, live out every type of known stardom. \u2018\u2018A Star Is Born\u2019\u2019 is just her latest reinvention.We could have seen this coming. Lady Gaga is our pop laureate of the grand entrance, our patron saint of operatic ingress. She has never, in a decade of global fame, been content to simply appear in a room; she has to plummet into it, shimmying down a cable like a diamond-encrusted spider. Or she hobbles in, a fembot on fake crutches, a high-fashion Tiny Tim. Before performing at the 2011 Grammys, she claimed to have slept in an oversize translucent egg for 72 hours, so that when she finally emerged, she could feel that she had experienced total \u201ccreative, embryonic incubation.\u201d For the first decade of her career, she was often at least seminude when descending every staircase. In her younger, more tenderized years, she trotted into the MTV Video Music Awards in a now-infamous gown and snow boots made of raw beef, not just a sight gag but a full-on olfactory happening, abattoir fabulous. Gaga once described herself as \u201ca show with no intermission,\u201d but it might be more accurate to view her career as a glorious series of overtures; her curtain is always rising. This is why her water ride in Venice elicited such collective delight in the form of vigorous retweeting. She may now be a serious actress, but she hasn\u2019t lost her sense of play.When I met Lady Gaga on a hazy afternoon a few days after her Venice tour, at her house so high up in the Hollywood Hills that I broke through the fog line before I reached it, she was still in full Marilyn mode. Her duckling-blond hair was molded into a halo around her face. Her lips were matte red, slightly overdrawn, an enthusiastic valentine. She was wearing the same towering patent-leather stilettos from the boat and a brown tiger-print wiggle dress, a midcentury silhouette favored by celluloid bombshells that vacuum-seals the calves into place. Her earrings, obsidian chandelier dangles heavy as hood ornaments, cast prismatic shadows on her clavicle and seemed to threaten the general integrity of her otherwise regal posture.Having seen \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d the day before, in which Gaga gives a notably stripped down, unbleached performance, I was slightly jarred as I watched her shuffle through her house (which also happened to have been the house of the avant-garde rocker Frank Zappa before she bought it from his family trust in 2016) in a full face and spike heels. In the film, her character, Ally, starts off makeup-free, a frustrated waitress with mud-puddle hair (Gaga\u2019s natural hue) who long ago abandoned her songwriting dreams and has settled for crooning live covers one night a week at a drag bar, the only woman on the bill. One night, Bradley Cooper, as the shambling, alcoholic rock star Jackson Maine, stumbles into the bar looking for a nightcap and instead discovers a muse \u2014 he is bewitched by her performance of \u201cLa Vie en Rose\u201d in an Edith Piaf costume complete with thin eyebrows fashioned from electrical tape.[Read our review of \u201cA Star Is Born.\u201d]Later that night, Jackson asks Ally why she doesn\u2019t pursue a music career. She tells him that she tried, she really did. She just couldn\u2019t find any industry types who could get past her face. They loved the way she sounded, hated the way she looked. Hearing this, Jackson reaches out with a single finger and traces the contours of her nose. While this is on its own an erotic gesture, it is Ally\u2019s reaction that makes the scene: She just breathes as he gently outlines the organ she feels worst about. It\u2019s an arresting moment, in which she seems both receptive and completely assured.Now, as we toured her house, Gaga was as opaque as Ally is transparent. She spoke carefully, in a breathy tone, as if she were in an active s\u00e9ance with an old movie star whose press agent advised her to remain enigmatic and demure. She showed me a bizarre bathroom, where she had found a bed over the shower; she gestured delicately at her backyard, announcing: \u201cSome beautiful lemon trees. It\u2019s a nice place to come and just create.\u201d When we got into the studio, she tiptoed through the cavernous live room, pointing out a grand piano in a voice so quiet I could barely hear her. We made our way to a small alcove with whitewashed walls and 20-foot ceilings, which looked like the storage room of an art museum \u2014 an echo chamber, she explained. I asked about the acoustics, in part because it seemed the polite thing to do, but in part because I was trying to open any conversational tap I could find. Whether she was feeling legitimately shy or was simply method-acting as a restrained ing\u00e9nue, she had yet to speak at full volume.In the echo chamber, the words of the song ricocheted, shaking the room: \u201cI\u2019m off the deep end! Watch as I dive in! I\u2019ll never meet the ground!\u201d When Gaga sings, her whole body vibrates. She clenches her fists, squeezes her eyes shut.After she finished belting, Gaga looked beatific, almost giddy, having answered my banal question with undeniable certainty. The acoustics in here, we agreed, were very good.This is why the lead role is so alluring to divas who want to explore the boundaries of their fame and what they had to endure to lasso it. These actresses, in drag as younger versions of themselves, get to wrestle with their flaws and air out their darkest fears. But we don\u2019t fear for them, not really, because we know how the story turns out. Garland, who always felt so intimidated by the leggy army of MGM blondes that she spent her life making self-deprecating jokes, fashioned herself into the world\u2019s most beloved brunette. Streisand, whose line \u201cHello, gorgeous\u201d was soaking in wry irony, turned a prominent bridge into a locus of desire.Gaga\u2019s innate New York City toughness brings a different flavor to the role than her predecessors. Where Janet Gaynor plays the starlet as pure and cornfed, Garland plays her as a plucky troubadour in pert ribbon bow ties and Streisand plays her as a wisecracking prima donna in colorful ponchos (hey, it was the \u201970s), Gaga\u2019s Ally is more world-weary and knowing. She is the kind of woman who gets into fistfights, who alternately sasses and fusses over her father (Andrew Dice Clay), a chauffeur who once had showbiz aspirations himself but never had a lucky break. When Cooper offered Gaga the role, he told her that \u201cthis is what it would be like if you were 31 and had never made it,\u201d and she readily embodies the ferocious hunger of the would-be famous. She\u2019s no innocent when she walks onstage to sing. She knows exactly what to do, and exactly what this will mean for her career. She\u2019s ready to go.Ally\u2019s journey is not about a singer developing her talent \u2014 that\u2019s already there. It is about finding her way toward an aesthetic once she has the world\u2019s attention. She dyes her hair Tang orange, begins working with a choreographer and sings springy pop songs about butts, all of which she does without wavering, even when Jackson drunkenly criticizes her for being inauthentic. Some viewers may read a rock-versus-pop hierarchy into Ally\u2019s transformations \u2014 that she is more \u201creal\u201d when she is harmonizing with Jackson\u2019s twangy melodies or sitting at her piano \u2014 but Gaga\u2019s onscreen mastery over both genres is a pre-emptive rebuttal to what is essentially a gendered bias. What \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d makes clear about Lady Gaga is that she possesses the dexterity to make whatever kind of music she likes.Cooper told me that he cast Gaga after seeing her perform \u201cLa Vie en Rose\u201d at a cancer benefit. The very next day, he drove to her Malibu home to test their chemistry. They bonded right away about their families (both East Coast, both Italian) and ate spaghetti on her porch. \u201cShe was completely illuminated by the sun,\u201d he said. \u201cSo charismatic. I thought inside my head, Oh, gosh. If she is like this on film, if that\u2019s the worst case scenario that she\u2019s this present on film, the movie will work.\u201dWhat she does know is that at some point, she felt free: to drop her birth name (Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta), to turn herself into an event, to keep shedding old skins.Gaga\u2019s debut album, \u201cThe Fame\u201d (quickly reissued with extra songs as \u201cThe Fame Monster\u201d), came out in August 2008, a season of optimism and political overhaul, when young people were ready to accept jangly pop hooks from a chimerical sprite who told them they could continually redefine themselves. Her first recordings may not have been too deep \u2014 \u201cPoker Face,\u201d still her second-biggest single to date, after \u201cJust Dance,\u201d is an ode to mirrored surfaces, to remaining willfully inscrutable \u2014 but they were catchy (she changed the way an entire generation hears the phrase \u201cooh la la\u201d), and their agile lightness was intentional. Much of her early music was thumping and linear: big synths, big hooks, the beats clinking together like a wristful of silver bangles. The music was a tool for propagating her radiant image, which was continually surprising to behold.When Gaga first emerged onto the pop scene, she was a phenomenon \u2014 a kooky amalgam of New York club-kid toughness, art-school experimentation, record-label grooming, classical vocal training and bona fide radio hits. She clearly took her cues from previous incarnations of major pop stardom (David Bowie\u2019s amphibious glam, Madonna\u2019s blond ambition, Michael Jackson\u2019s dual love of sparkles and precision), but she was even more focused than her predecessors on the live event, on the coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre. She started pushing boundaries and stopped wearing pants; she became a walking billboard for avant-garde fashion (Alexander McQueen\u2019s ankle-bending hoof heels, a jacket covered in felt Kermit the Frogs, several gowns made of human hair, that meat dress), a fact that served to make every other artist at the time who wasn\u2019t rolling around onstage in a pool of fake blood seem, frankly, dull.Gaga\u2019s initial obsession with masquerade predicted the double lives we all live now, our simultaneous existences as living, breathing people and disembodied avatars. But instead of seeing those identities as segmented \u2014 the real person, the facade \u2014 she put forth the concept that it\u2019s possible, and ultimately adaptive, in a fractured world to try to free yourself from old boundaries. You can be an insider and an outsider at the same time, a human and an alien. All that is solid melts into Gaga. If this seems paradoxical, it is; but the paradox is where Gaga shines. Postmodern double truths are her milieu.\u201cI do keep transforming into a new shell of me,\u201d she told me. \u201cSo sure, there is an acting component to what I do, or a showbiz component to what I do. But the word \u2018acting,\u2019 it\u2019s hard for me to talk about in that way, because \u2018acting\u2019 to me almost implies faking it.\u201d She insisted to me that all her iterations form an unbroken line, that the performance is the reality.Gaga has, over the last decade, arguably moved the entire pop apparatus toward forceful weirdness. Her influence is everywhere \u2014 she opened the doors for more female hitmakers to be cheekily bizarre (Miley Cyrus grinding on a wrecking ball, Katy Perry with her sniper-rifle bra filled with whipped cream, Sia living under her wig, even St. Vincent\u2019s indie Fritz Lang affect) \u2014 but as a result, Gaga\u2019s early maximalism began to feel less vital to the cultural conversation. In 2011, Adele\u2019s \u201c21\u201d cemented a new austerity in pop; all she had to do to sell 11 million records was stand in one place and sing plaintively about heartbreak.So Gaga swerved again, and again, and again. She made a jazz record with Tony Bennett. She made a crunchier, heavy-metallish album called \u201cArtpop\u201d that mostly failed to connect with the public, at least on the large Gagagian scale she was used to (it sold fewer than a million copies). When she turned 30, she released a more minimalist fifth record called \u201cJoanne,\u201d after an aunt who died young of complications from lupus. She promoted the album in ripped T-shirts and a plain, pink felt hat. She toured dive bars before the arenas. She also released the Netflix documentary \u201cGaga: Five Foot Two,\u201d a v\u00e9rit\u00e9 glimpse into her daily life as she prepped for the 2017 Super Bowl, produced and promoted \u201cJoanne\u201d and spoke openly about the debilitating pain caused by her fibromyalgia (something she had been dealing with privately for years). The documentary presents Gaga with a striking lack of vanity. She appears on camera with dirty hair and a bare face. This is Gaga the Vulnerable, Gaga the Sensitive Soul.That film ends with her performance at the Super Bowl, where she sang all the karaoke staples of her back catalog \u2014 \u201cBad Romance,\u201d \u201cTelephone,\u201d even \u201cJust Dance\u201d \u2014 with gusto in a sequined bodysuit, thrusting through the jangly disco beats of \u201cBorn This Way\u201d in high-heel boots, surrounded by an army of dancers in iridescent capes. It was a blistering set, a Greatest Hits Cardio Workout and a truly impressive display of her cultural dominance. But it also felt elegiac, as if it belonged to a different era, when Gaga was giving stump speeches about overturning \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d and the song became an anthem of the fight for gay marriage on a national scale. In recent years, queer culture has become more anti-institutional, less about normalizing and more about resisting norms. In a way, Gaga\u2019s galactic fame, which once gave her such a huge platform as an advocate for equality, became a liability when the conversation became more intimate and nuanced. Pop is not entirely post-spectacle (Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s recent Coachella performance was a multiact extravaganza), but it is evolving into a less bombastic space. It is getting more raw, smaller. And Gaga is doing the same.She has not given up on the power of an audacious live show (this winter, she will put on a pyrotechnic Las Vegas residency called \u201cEnigma\u201d), but in making \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d she is entering into a softer conversation with the public \u2014 about talent, about ambition, about her own trajectory. Ally is the most human of all of Gaga\u2019s creations, and offering her to us \u2014 her fear, her loyalty, her shattered heart after tragedy \u2014 is a different kind of gamble than stepping out in front of millions dressed like a holographic Muppet. She is, in essence, making exploratory autofiction on a grand scale, even as she is playing yet another character.The studio is her sanctuary, and one of the main reasons she felt she had to have the property. She is also working to preserve as many of the home\u2019s oddities as possible: the vintage submarine doors with thick portholes, a giant dragon mural, the library floor painted to look like a lily pond. She told me she loves the house\u2019s \u201cintricate chaos.\u201dGaga is an auction shopper \u2014 she likes to acquire iconic objects, created by iconic personalities \u2014 and as I toured Zappa\u2019s house it occurred to me that we were standing in a giant collector\u2019s item of sorts, an 8,000-square-foot twig in the magpie\u2019s nest of pop cultural artifacts that she has been building for a decade. In 2012, she purchased 55 items from Michael Jackson\u2019s private archive, including his leather \u201cBad\u201d jacket and a crystal glove. That same year, she bought an eggshell silk Alexander McQueen gown from the collection of the British fashion maven Daphne Guinness. In 2016, for her Dive Bar Tour in support of \u201cJoanne,\u201d Gaga rolled up to a show in Elvis\u2019s pink 1955 Cadillac Fleetwood (she was just borrowing it).Perhaps this collector\u2019s impulse is what she absorbed from her early study of Warhol. Gaga is an artist of accrual, of remixing and reimagination, of pulling her heroes into her gravitational orbit. She once told an interviewer that her \u201cwhole career is a tribute to David Bowie,\u201d but her career is really a tribute to all the different ways a person can be monstrously famous: She wants to wear every costume, live out every type of stardom to its maximalist extreme.If she was going to be a movie star, she couldn\u2019t just step into a role, or a film, that no one had ever heard of \u2014 she wanted to waltz into a lineage. When she was younger, she told me, she used to watch \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d over and over, convinced that Judy Garland was the greatest entertainer alive. \u201cJudy, I just think she\u2019s tremendous,\u201d she told me. \u201cThere\u2019s a vulnerability behind her eyes, the way she speaks, she has big features. I just always wanted to be like her. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d And now she is standing on the very same stage.Earlier in the afternoon, she showed me a room that was empty save for a gigantic photograph of her own face, at least 15 feet across, in a gilded frame. \u201cIt was a gift from Bradley,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the last frame of the movie. Do you know the scene?\u201dI did know it. It is the moment when Ally is standing on the stage of the Shrine Auditorium \u2014 where Garland shot her final scene \u2014 in an ice blue evening gown, singing a homage to her late husband. She starts out timid and drained of expression, explaining to the audience that she is going to sing the last song that Jackson wrote for her, and that maybe with their support, she can get through it. But as the ballad goes on, her voice swells and becomes an avalanche. It\u2019s a bravura performance in extreme close-up, a sort of symphonic summoning of every woman who has played the part. Gaga channels both the way Garland sang (wounded, tonally bright, barely holding it together) and the way Streisand did (forceful, sweeping, with a diffident jutting of the jaw). But Gaga adds something of her own: a sensual, earthy confidence, like gasoline in her veins.When she finishes, a single elephant tear rolls down her face. Magically, the moment somehow avoids bathos \u2014 the tear feels truly earned. After watching her perform this scene, I felt elated by what Gaga managed to do, not just for her character but for herself. You desperately want to know what her future holds after the curtain falls.I asked Gaga later what we can expect from her next phase. Of course, there\u2019s Vegas and a new record on the way, and she\u2019s reading piles of scripts. But she really didn\u2019t want to discuss any of that. Instead, she just smiled enigmatically. \u201cOh,\u201d she sighed. \u201cI\u2019m just shape-shifting again.\u201dStylists: Sandra Amador and Tom Eerebout. Hair: Frederic Aspiras.

{"Headline": "U.S. Stocks Became Expensive. Are Other Countries Better Bets?", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byA 6.7 percent decline in the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index in six trading sessions through Thursday nearly erased the 7.2 percent gain the index recorded in the third quarter. The market rebounded a bit on Friday. But even before the six-day plunge, the narrowness of the quarter\u2019s advance hinted that the market was on shakier ground than the peak reached in the period might have suggested.The strong performance during the quarter was concentrated in American stocks, primarily of a handful of big-name technology companies, such as Amazon, Netflix, Apple and Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Markets fell almost everywhere else.The gap between stock returns in the United States and elsewhere has led some \u2014 but definitely not all \u2014 strategists to conclude that for American investors, there are better prospects abroad.\u201cThe U.S. is an expensive, frothy market priced to give you terrible forward returns,\u201d said Robert Arnott, chairman of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, who is seeking opportunities in foreign markets.On the other hand, Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said the outperformance of the American market was justified \u2014 and may well continue. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge difference between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world, and between the U.S. market and the rest of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest of the developed world has half as much growth, and it\u2019s the same with profits. It\u2019s a legitimate divergence. It\u2019s not solely a matter of sentiment.\u201dLegitimate or not, the divergence between foreign and domestic markets \u2014 and how much they cost \u2014 accelerated in recent months. The Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-U.S. exchange-traded fund was down 4.9 percent in the year through September, while the SPDR S.&P. 500 E.T.F. rose 8.9 percent, helped by a 7.2 percent increase in the underlying index in the third quarter. Based on the ratio of share prices to book value, American stocks were more than twice as expensive in September as stocks in the rest of the world, according to Bank of America, a record premium.Leading the laggards downward were emerging markets, several of which have plunged because of heavy amounts of foreign debt, and Europe, where indexes are heavily weighted in banks that are owed a lot of that money.The comparative strength of domestic stocks has been justified by the superior performance of the American economy and the presence of so many high-quality, high-growth companies, investment advisers like Mr. Golub say. Others, like Mr. Arnott, counter that American business prospects cannot be marvelous enough to justify such a cavernous valuation discrepancy, especially over the medium-to-long haul. Foreign markets, especially in the developing world, are bound to bounce back and reward the patience of investors who take a chance on them, they say.Mr. Arnott, for example, highlighted an array of measures showing that American stocks are expensive when compared with their own history or with foreign alternatives, especially in the developing world.\u201cEmerging market stocks are cheap,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have been whacked because of fears that a trade war will do these economies great damage.\u201d With valuations at half the levels of American stocks\u2019, he said, \u201cthey\u2019re reflecting the worst case, not the most likely case.\u201dBonds issued in the developing world also offer good value, in his view. Debt denominated in local currencies yields 6 percent or more, double what long-term Treasury issues offer.Yet emerging market assets may not seem like bargains to anyone familiar with the currency collapses and economic difficulties besetting countries like Turkey and Argentina. Lower stock prices or an extra three or four points of yield may be small compensation for the possibility of further currency losses or the added risk of default.But those countries account for a minuscule fraction of emerging stock and bond markets. Other places are on more solid economic and financial footing, although it might take a while before recognition sets in that they\u2019re still moving in the right direction.\u201cThe emerging market story is intact, but you have to have a longer-term focus; emerging markets are still not for the faint of heart,\u201d said Elizabeth Morrissey, managing partner of Kleiman International Consultants. \u201cThe best bets in these markets continue to be the ones growing strongly.\u201dStrong, persistent economic growth, propelled in part by young, rising populations, can overcome occasional bouts of weakness in mature economies, policy errors at home, large foreign debts and other unfavorable conditions, she said.Indonesia, for instance, one of her favorite markets, runs large fiscal and current-account deficits, Ms. Morrissey said. The country owes a lot of money to foreign lenders, and its currency, the rupiah, is trading near where it was during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, but economic growth is at a five-year high.India, another favorite, also runs large deficits and has a weak currency. On top of that, India is \u201cmassively oil reliant,\u201d she said. But its economy grew at an 8.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter, driven by the country\u2019s dynamic private sector.\u201cThere are still significant portions of the populations in these countries striving for an iPhone,\u201d Ms. Morrissey said. \u201cThere\u2019s still a significant growth story.\u201dThe arguments for investing in the United States are strong, too. Measures of consumer and business sentiment are close to all-time highs. The September reading of the Conference Board index of consumer confidence, for example, was the highest since 2000.Highlights of mutual fund performance in the third quarter.Leaders and LaggardsStocks vs. BondsAmong general domestic stock funds.Average returns, by fund category.12 MONTHS3RD QTR.LEADERS12 MONTHS3RD QTR.++++15.20.42.10.8%+++\u20135.40.70.10.1%General stock fundsAlger SmallCap Focus++++++++51.829.548.935.730.957.747.936.5%++++++++16.416.315.213.813.813.613.113.0%Taxable bondsQuantified STFInvestorInternational stocksVirtus Zeven.InnovativeMunicipal bondsBaron DiscoveryInstl.Growth vs. ValueCongress SmallCap GrowthReturns in the third quarter.GrowthBlendValueDelaware SmidCap Growth+8%Morgan StanleyInst.

American stock indexes are heavily weighted toward technology companies, while European indexes have a larger proportion of banks, which have been struggling in part because of their extensive exposure to lenders in the developing world.Fund returns in the third quarter confirmed the outperformance but not by as much as you might expect from the moves in the underlying assets. The average domestic stock fund rose 5 percent, according to Morningstar, led by portfolios specializing in health care, energy and technology. The average international fund gained 0.1 percent, depressed by losses in India and China funds.The average taxable bond fund returned 0.7 percent in the period.Rebecca Patterson, chief investment officer of Bessemer Trust, also finds the discrepancy in investment returns justified.\u201cThe U.S. leadership this year is a reflection of diverging fundamentals in different parts of the world,\u201d she said. \u201cSignificant stimulus\u201d \u2014 from the Federal Reserve until recently and then from a big round of tax cuts \u2014 \u201chas helped lift corporate earnings. I\u2019m not surprised that the U.S. is outperforming by so much this year. I guess the question is: Can the outperformance last?\u201dIt\u2019s a tough one to answer in a world of interconnected economies. Some developments that would worsen conditions at home might cause even greater damage abroad, Ms. Patterson said, while favorable domestic developments might provide a greater lift elsewhere.If the Fed has second thoughts about monetary tightening and turns more dovish, for instance, it could depress the dollar, easing pressures on foreign economies with large debts denominated in dollars. \u201cThe rest of the world could catch up,\u201d she said.By contrast, an acceleration of the slow-motion trade war that has been worrying investors all year \u2014 although not enough to put much of a crimp in market returns \u2014 would hurt the domestic economy, but it could damp growth to a much greater extent in places like China, she said. A slowdown in China, in turn, would have a more serious impact on Europe than the United States.Another potential impediment to European markets, Ms. Patterson said, is the imminent start of a monetary tightening cycle by the European Central Bank. The Fed has been far more hawkish on inflation, but its European counterpart may soon join it in raising interest rates and selling assets acquired in its quantitative easing program.With such prospects, she prefers to maintain a particularly high allocation to domestic stocks. But favorable moves on the trade front would persuade her to put more into emerging markets, particularly China.Mr. Golub contends that investors have \u201calmost an obsession with what could go wrong\u201d for American stocks, although he acknowledged that \u201cif people were really cautious, the market wouldn\u2019t be going up\u201d as it did in the third quarter.He also highlighted a number of factors that are \u201ca risk but not a problem,\u201d including inflation, the elections next month and the trade backdrop. He said that valuations are not cheap and that long-term returns could suffer for that.\u201cThere is an unbelievable number of potential threats to the stock market, but none of them are derailing the market yet,\u201d Mr. Golub said.The last word in that quote might worry some investors, especially lately, but he recommends owning some of the highest of fliers, including technology stocks that focus on consumer services, such as Priceline and Amazon, and on communication services, including Netflix, Alphabet and Facebook. He also favors financial companies.If there are risks but not problems in the United States, as Mr. Golub put it, Nick Kaiser, manager of the Sextant International fund, finds problems but not as much risk overseas.\u201cThere are more opportunities in foreign markets than domestic,\u201d Mr. Kaiser said. Even a country like Argentina \u201cis a great place to invest,\u201d he said, as long as the money is put to work in stocks when they trade at low valuations, and not bonds, which are far more susceptible to inflation.His strategy is to look for high-quality companies, even if the quality of the economy in places where they do business may be suspect. An example in Argentina is MercadoLibre, an online retailer that operates across South America.Other portfolio holdings that Mr. Kaiser mentioned include Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, a French engineering company; Nice, an Israeli cybersecurity concern; and two Dutch businesses: the consumer electronics company Philips, and ASML Holding, a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment.\u201cWe see a lot of opportunities in Europe,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there may be more in Argentina and Brazil.\u201dMr. Arnott likewise sees a world full of healthy investment prospects. He finds it easier to list what he would avoid than what he would buy.\u201cThere\u2019s a richer spread of opportunity than usual, just not in the U.S.,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just need a little upside surprise and you\u2019ve got a bull market.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "The Transformational Bliss of Borrowing Your Office Clothes", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "Rent the Runway\u2019s Unlimited service saves working women something more valuable than money: their time.Supported byOn a Friday morning in August, Sushma Dwivedi, a senior vice president at Edelman, the global marketing conglomerate, bustled around her Harlem apartment in a blue-and-white-striped cotton dress. With her toddler and newborn out with a nanny, Ms. Dwivedi, who was on maternity leave but preparing for a meeting with a senior colleague in a few days, intended to get some things done. High on her list: assessing the contents of a recently delivered dark-blue garment bag.Ms. Dwivedi, 37, is a member of Rent the Runway Unlimited, a service that, for $159 a month, allows subscribers to borrow up to four pieces of clothing and accessories from a designer-laden library of more than 450,000 items and keep them for as long as they want. If subscribers can\u2019t bear to part with something, they can buy it, generally for about half the retail price. (A cocoon-like wool cardigan from Jil Sander Navy sells in stores for $1,275, but costs $765 through Rent the Runway.) When members buy an item, or return it, via a prepaid shipping label in their garment bag, a spot for something new opens up.Though Rent the Runway was originally conceived as a solution for women who didn\u2019t want to invest in party-wear they might use only once, Unlimited has become a strategic solution for professional women such as Ms. Dwivedi, who manages 30 employees in Edelman\u2019s food and beverage department and regularly gets called into the offices of clients like Pepsi and Chobani.\u201cThe wardrobe thing, when I was trying to lose the baby weight, was frustrating,\u201d said Ms. Dwivedi, recalling her first pregnancy. \u201cI knew what I could buy when I was pregnant. I knew how big I was, but afterward, what was I going to do? Buy an entire wardrobe at five pounds thinner, five more pounds thinner, and on and on?\u201d She added, \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to look frumpy or have someone turn around and say, \u2018Wow, she looked a lot better before.\u2019\u201dSince Rent the Runway introduced Unlimited two years ago, the service has amassed tens of thousands of subscribers in part by promising to solve the problem of what to wear to work, for everyone from new hires to C-suite executives. (The company declined to confirm its user numbers, but analysts said that perhaps 50,000 people are active subscribers.) It is fast displacing the start-up\u2019s original business model. Rent the Runway was founded in 2009 as a way for people to borrow couture on an item-by-item basis. This year, Unlimited, which also has an $89-a-month tier, will account for the majority of revenue.\u201cI just have too much stuff: stuff that I bought, that I don\u2019t like anymore, that I don\u2019t wear anymore,\u201d said Kristin Lemkau, the chief marketing officer of JPMorgan Chase and a self-described Unlimited \u201csuperfan\u201d of two years. On a recent Wednesday morning at her office, on the 36th floor of a glossy Park Avenue monolith, she wore a flouncy, frilly black dress sprayed with pastel-colored daisies. Lemkau, 51, who helps oversee a $5 billion budget, routinely speaks at conferences on her firm\u2019s behalf, sometimes in places like the South of France or the Swiss Alps, which come with their own, rarefied dress codes.Before signing up for Unlimited, she regularly met with a wardrobe consultant near her Rye, N.Y., home. \u201cI\u2019d go to her house and pick out stuff,\u201d Ms. Lemkau said. \u201cI was never thrilled with the clothes. It was the same old black dress and black pants, and I started looking like I was in mourning all the time.\u201dShe ruffled her daisy-printed hem. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I would\u2019ve bought this, but it\u2019s super cute, it\u2019s fun. I look forward to getting dressed every day instead of, \u2018What thing am I going to wear? Is my dry cleaning back?\u2019 I don\u2019t remember looking forward to getting dressed, ever.\u201dUnlimited frees mental space for women to think about more important matters: what to say in that big meeting; how to describe their employment history in a crucial job interview; how to, in the grand scheme of their professional lives, get ahead. \u201cWomen spend more time, more energy, more, just, time being distracted with shopping and thinking about the way they look compared to men,\u201d Ms. Lemkau said. \u201cEven at work, men were basically just deciding what tie to wear, and now, for the most part, they don\u2019t even wear ties. Is this service another way to potentially level the playing field?\u201dBefore joining Unlimited in 2016, Ms. Dwivedi spent untold hours rifling through fast-fashion stores like H&M and Zara, searching for a trendy blazer or statement necklace to liven up her work wardrobe. These days, she typically \u201cshops\u201d on Rent the Runway\u2019s iPhone app, scrolling through silk blouses and floral dresses as if they were Spotify songs, assessing member-submitted photos of the clothes out in the real world.\u201cI\u2019m having drinks with my mentor on Wednesday. I wasn\u2019t sure what to wear to that, so I gave myself a couple of options. If this is as flattering as I think it could be, I\u2019ll probably wear this,\u201d Ms. Dwivedi said, holding up a striped, sleeveless linen shift dress in a clear plastic sheathe. \u201cAnd if not, this maxi\u201d \u2014 a floor length, flowy black dress emblazoned with tropical blossoms.This is the trade-off. While Ms. Dwivedi luxuriates in the designer clothing that does fit \u2014 she received a steady stream of compliments from co-workers on a pink, plaid Trina Turk coat that she wore while pregnant with her first child \u2014 the stuff that does not must be sent back to the warehouse before she can order something new. The process generally takes a day or two.The Rent the Runway app and website regularly prompt users to review what they borrowed, and with a few taps, Ms. Dwivedi could report that the dress was not true to size. Despite the inconvenience of waiting for another shipment, she prefers this process to trying on outfits in a store. \u201cI would rather have the shaming of it all and the judging experience on my own,\u201d she said.\u201cOver 50 percent of our customers provide data back to us after they rent, every single time,\u201d said Jenn Hyman, 38, who is Rent the Runway\u2019s chief executive and co-founder. \u201cWithout an incentive, our customers want to make this service better for other women, and they\u2019re telling us because they want us to fix the problem.\u201d She was standing in the company\u2019s 250,000-square-foot warehouse in Secaucus, N.J. \u2014 a structure it says is the largest dry-cleaning facility in the world. Rent the Runway calls it the Dream Fulfillment Center.It is garment-tracking infrastructure of staggering proportions. Unlike companies that have democratized access to movies (Netflix) or music (Spotify), Rent the Runway peddles in touchable, feel-able, not-streamable material goods \u2014 garments that lose buttons and rip and stain and go through God knows what after they slide onto the bodies of their temporary owners.\u201cThere are three times during the process where we\u2019re doing a quality inspection,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. Next to her, an employee was sniffing the contents of a garment bag, one of hundreds that UPS and FedEx deliver to the warehouse each morning. \u201cCustomers sometimes tell us that there\u2019s an item they didn\u2019t wear, but our smell test is more important,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. \u201cEvery single item goes through a cleaning and sanitation process.\u201dIndustrial washers spun, dryers tumbled and garments on hangers clicked as they made their way through a maze of scaffolding, en route to a machine that would spit them out encased in plastic. \u201cThe system knows that that blouse needs to wait for a pair of jeans to come in,\u201d Ms. Hyman said. \u201cIt won\u2019t send it over to shipping until all of the items in that order have been brought together. That\u2019s something someone\u2019s wearing to an event,\u201d she said, gesturing at an off-the-shoulder gown of salmon-colored chiffon. \u201cVegas!\u201d she trilled, pointing at a white-and-red-sequined bomber jacket.Of Rent the Runway\u2019s 1,200 employees, 770 are in Secaucus. A second such facility is due to open in Dallas next year, to speed up delivery times to users not on the East Coast. An additional 130 people work on the company\u2019s engineering, information technology and analytics teams. They continually tweak algorithms to identify pieces that customers might like and highlight them on the app\u2019s home screen, similar to recommendations offered by Amazon and Netflix.\u201cWe\u2019re collecting hundreds of thousands of data points every week: style, fit of the garment, what occasion you wore that to, what else is going on in your life, who are you?\u201d said Ms. Hyman. \u201cWe\u2019re creating one-to-one style personas for every user we have, which is helping us create an individual home page for you, where we can recommend clothing that you might like. Part of that is not just to recommend the things that you\u2019re already comfortable with, but to help you discover things that you didn\u2019t know you\u2019d love.\u201d Essentially, they\u2019re using data to engineer whimsy \u2014 that feeling of seeing something in a store window and rushing in to plunk down a credit card.Rent the Runway shares its findings with the designers whose clothing it stocks. (The company buys wholesale, like a department store.) \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing amount of data that traditional retailers don\u2019t always share: What other brands is she wearing, how many times do our dresses get dry-cleaned and still come back as new?\u201d said Jan-Hendrik Schlottmann, the C.E.O. of the high-fashion label Derek Lam. \u201cYou learn a lot from that and from reading the comments the clients make online. It\u2019s great market research, frankly.\u201dMr. Schlottmann said he doesn\u2019t worry that rentals will cannibalize sales. \u201cThe Rent the Runway customer is not a customer we\u2019re losing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to spend $1,500 on a dress, because she doesn\u2019t understand the value. We kind of think we\u2019re taking money away from fast fashion by letting her try on and rent clothes. Instead of having her buy Zara\u2019s copy of our dress, I\u2019d rather have her experience our construction, our fabric. Hopefully, she will buy it when she\u2019s ready.\u201dAs a private company, Rent the Runway declined to share its revenue or profit. Ms. Hyman also declined to specify how many Unlimited members there are, but said the subscription business was up 150 percent year over year. In March, an investment of $20 million, in part from the founders of the Chinese e-commerce behemoth Alibaba, reportedly put the company\u2019s valuation at $800 million.Even if Rent the Runway is small compared to established fashion brands, the NPD analyst Marshal Cohen considers the company\u2019s impact significant. \u201cThey are a disrupter. They have really changed the dynamic of what goes on in the marketplace,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not building wardrobes the way we used to, we\u2019re not buying as many shoes, as many bags, we\u2019re wearing a few staple items and mixing and matching them. We\u2019ve gotten so casual in the workplace that we\u2019re basically wearing loungewear.\u201dSeventy-five percent of the clothing that gets shipped out to Unlimited members falls into the broad bucket of business casual. Members have written in asking for more tailored options, and as a result, this fall, the company\u2019s business formal assortment \u2014 suits and pencil skirts by labels including Theory, Tibi and Iro \u2014 will increase 250 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s attire that a conservative lawyer could wear to the office everyday,\u201d Ms. Hyman said.Before joining Unlimited in 2016, Ariel Cohen, a 29-year-old account director for the New York public relations firm Magrino, spent about $500 a month at shops like Club Monaco and Anthropologie. She\u2019s cut that to $100 a month \u2014 and eliminated her monthly dry cleaning bill, also around $100. \u201cI make investments in things now that I consider \u2018forever pieces,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m able to have the more colorful and loud parts of my wardrobe be things that I can wear once or twice, post a pic to Instagram, and move on.\u201d She gestured at her Jason Wu pants: white, wide-legged, emblazoned with big, blue flowers. \u201cLike these, I\u2019d never buy.\u201dFor women entering the job force, Unlimited has been a crucial hack. \u201cTo go from college to my first career, it was really challenging,\u201d said Elisabeth Armstrong, 24, a former television reporter in Tennessee who recently transitioned to a finance job in Colorado. \u201cMy salary was not really conducive to buying a new wardrobe.\u201d\u201cI found myself falling into this pattern of fast fashion, buying a blazer here, a dress there,\u201d before signing up for Unlimited in 2016, Ms. Armstrong said. \u201cIt\u2019s really challenging for us, as women. Men have the standard suit. With the emphasis on your personal brand, your presentation, I think there\u2019s more weight on appearance than there ever has been.\u201d\u201cI had exhausted the options that I own \u2014 my co-workers had seen them all,\u201d said Caroline Peck, a 25-year-old advertising associate in Birmingham, Ala. \u201cRecently, I was in San Antonio for a big client meeting. I rented this beautiful dress, and even my client complimented me. Then I told them about Unlimited.\u201d Ms. Peck ended up buying the dress, a black, full-skirted Erin Fetherston number with a white Peter Pan collar.Sarah Joyce, who works at a major technology company in Los Angeles, joined Unlimited last December, feeling frumpy and uninspired by her wardrobe. Her initial attitude, she said, was: \u201cRad. I\u2019m going to take more risks, I can send it back, I\u2019m going to do the Chlo\u00e9, the Veronica Beard.\u201d\u201cI was like, now I know how female baller executives look hot,\u201d said Ms. Joyce, 40. \u201cYou\u2019re faking it till you make it. It\u2019s awesome.\u201d She got so much praise on a maroon Cinq \u00e0 Sept maxi dress that she ended up buying it for $500. Then it happened again. \u201cI ended up buying everything,\u201d said Ms. Joyce. \u201cI bought a romper, blouses. It was a problem. Ninety percent of the stuff I rented, I never returned. Then it occurred to me this stuff has been worn by other people so many times, that\u2019s probably why it\u2019s cheap.\u201dIn June, wary of devouring Unlimited\u2019s collection of designer purses, Ms. Joyce canceled her membership. She also grew weary of attracting attention at the office. \u201cIt made such a fuss at work,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone was like, \u2018Oh, is that also Rent the Runway?\u2019 I felt like a walking billboard.\u201dSome women don\u2019t mind this, like Elizabeth Derby, a 29-year-old senior product marketing manager at Artsy, an art start-up. I spoke to her this summer, when she worked at Betterment, a financial services start-up in New York. \u201cThe funny thing is, there are a lot of men that work here, more men than women, and way more guys in the office know that I use Rent the Runway because they\u2019re always commenting on stuff and saying, \u2018I wish they had that for guys,\u2019\u201d Ms. Derby said. At the time, she was part of a Slack channel that Unlimited subscribers at Betterment use to rate outfits and collect garment bags for drop-off at a showroom Rent the Runway keeps on West 15th Street in Manhattan. (Returns taken there get processed faster than those sent to the warehouse.)\u201cThere\u2019s also the sustainability factor,\u201d said her tag-checking co-worker, Danielle Shechtman. \u201cIf you keep buying clothes and not using them, it\u2019s pretty harmful for the environment.\u201dMs. Derby nodded. \u201cEvery year I get rid of four or five garbage bags of clothes. I don\u2019t even know how I accumulate them.\u201dWith unlimited options comes a kind of perverse pressure: There\u2019s no excuse to not look good. I discovered this myself in April, when I signed up for Unlimited. One major upside: Since enlisting, I\u2019ve purchased only one piece of clothing, a dress I initially rented through Unlimited. But on the app, I routinely went down the rabbit hole of comparing one potential rental to another, reading review after review, scrolling through top picks, new arrivals and categories like \u201cDress Spotlight\u201d and \u201cTrending: Statement Tops.\u201d I had to force myself to stop.It happened again in real life in August, when I visited Rent the Runway\u2019s New York showroom, a Willy Wonka-esque emporium for fashion fiends. Intending to be in and out in 20 minutes, I instead stayed for more than an hour.When I got there, a smiling greeter prompted me to sign up for a fitting room on an iPad, so I could spend time browsing and not standing in line. Salespeople \u2014 if they can be called that, since none of the merchandise had price tags \u2014 went out of their way to unload my arms as they filled with hangers.But when I got to where I was staying, I tried the dress on again and started sweating almost immediately. I ended up wearing a cotton dress I\u2019d owned for three years to the meeting. Later, I inelegantly stuffed the Marni into my suitcase and eventually sent it back to the warehouse unworn.Rent the Runway can\u2019t be expected to solve the paralysis of choice or irrationality that plagues some of us; if anything, its future plans will exacerbate those tendencies. Ms. Hyman wants customers to be able to borrow more items, from an ever-expanding library of brands, at any time they choose.\u201cThe vision is that within a few blocks of where all of our subscribers live, all over the country, our members have access to a magical closet that has inventory that\u2019s personalized to them, that they can access 24 hours a day,\u201d said Ms. Hyman. \u201cWe\u2019re building out the technology to make seamless access to that closet as delightful and frictionless as possible.\u201d She added, \u201cRent the Runway closets should feel as organic in your day as going to Starbucks.\u201dThe ephemeral, on-demand closets of Ms. Hyman\u2019s dreams would be something altogether different, and freeing. They would allow us to use our old-fashioned physical closets, and our time and energy, for something else.Advertisement"}

Hanging plants, pendant lamps and blue and white walls create a welcoming atmosphere. The restaurant\u2019s name harkens to Ms. Khan\u2019s best childhood memories, a homage to the train she once took to her family\u2019s summer home. Its menu honors her experiences as an immigrant and daughter, influenced by her family\u2019s Mughali and Nawabi recipes, the flavors of Kolkata (where she was born and raised), and local produce.Humble British vegetables shine in dishes like the beetroot chop, a croquette of mashed beets that balances spice and earthy sweetness. Beets also lend their rich color and flavor to raita, staining the cooling yogurt sauce bright pink. A pile of tender baby eggplants hummed with the striking flavors of peanut and coconut.Kolkata\u2019s street food inspired a first course of puchkas, delicate wheat and semolina shells stuffed with a mixture of spiced potatoes and chickpeas that require a two-step eating process: pour a dash of tamarind water into the shell, and then pop the whole thing in your mouth for an explosive bite of crunch, tang, and spice. Tangra chili-garlic prawns blended heat, browned garlic, and the sassy succulence of perfectly cooked shellfish.Main courses included braised chicken thighs lavished with tomatoes and fresh dill, and a fork-tender goat curry smoldering with tempered chili. Bengali aloo dum \u2014 spicy potatoes, at once floury and fiery \u2014 are scooped up with puri, the puffed, fried flatbread typical to Indian home cooking. \u201cThese are the common foods of Kolkata that everyone eats,\u201d Ms. Khan said. For dessert, there are equally homey offerings like stewed apricots drizzled with thick cream, or bhapa doi, a creamy steamed yogurt pudding not typically seen on London menus.Advertisement"}

Olivia (DeWanda Wise) is pregnant with the couple\u2019s first child but is reluctant to become a mother. One reason is that she is subject to dreams and surreal visions that today might be seen as symptoms of post-traumatic stress.

Why add to their number?Yet all this is still only a small part of Mr. Love\u2019s complicated picture of Olivia, whose sublimation of self sometimes reminded me of women in plays by William Inge, but with an even deeper secret inflecting her actions.But every time the play began to engage me through character it disengaged me through plot contrivance.

{"Headline": "A Store Had to Move Thousands of Books. So a Human Chain Was Formed.", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLONDON \u2014 The plea went out a few weeks ago from the bookstore in a port city in southern England: \u201cCare to lend a hand?\u201dVolunteers were needed for \u201cheavy manual work\u201d in shifts. It was \u201cessential\u201d that they be able to lift and carry boxes and office supplies.Among the supplies: thousands upon thousands of books.The shop was looking to move lock, stock and barrel about 150 meters (just under 500 feet) to a three-story building that used to house a bank. Would anybody respond to the call for help?This past Sunday, the bookstore got more than a helping hand \u2014 it got hundreds.The shop stopped counting after about 250 people showed up, Ms. Haynes said by phone.Hand-to-hand, the chain of people passed thousands of books over a few hours.\u201cIt was very moving,\u201d Ms. Haynes said, adding that the employees were \u201call getting choked up\u201d about how members of the community had leapt to help out.It was the local community, after all, that came to the bookshop\u2019s rescue more than once before \u2014 including when, after 15 years, it had to move because the rent increased. The store settled on a former bank building up the street.The move paid off, and the shop entered into arrangements to receive community donations and loans, agreeing to pay back the latter over one, five or 10 years, Ms. Haynes said.At a time when independent bookshops are disappearing, she said, \u201cwe believe in the value of bookshops.\u201dLast year, the Booksellers Association noted that the number of independent bookshops in Britain had fallen for the 11th year in a row. In 2005, there were 1,535 independent stores, but by 2017 that figure had fallen to 867.The association cited \u201ca cocktail of pressures\u201d for the closings, including rising rents, competition from e-books and online sellers, along with the rising popularity of other entertainment platforms like Netflix and gaming.October Books originally began as a small shop for feminist, L.G.B.T., socialist and Green Party literature, she said. It later expanded to fiction, children\u2019s literature and books about organic food and fair trade. Now, it has five paid employees, a social media guru and part-time volunteers.The shop wanted the move on Sunday to be a special event.\u201cWe wanted something that was accessible for the whole family, for children and people who were older who wouldn\u2019t necessarily be able to paint or move heavy pieces, to help out,\u201d Ms. Haynes said.\u201cIt was a lovely way of including everyone and get the whole community involved. We\u2019ve got a lot of good will in our community.\u201dThe shop plans to sell the second floor of the former bank building to a charity in Southampton to create supportive housing for homeless people, and to create a community hub in the back, she said. As a nonprofit, any income would be reinvested the business.Ms. Haynes said the bookstore was still moving. Opening day is scheduled for Saturday.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Should Art Be a Battleground for Social Justice?", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "In 2018, culture is being evaluated for its moral correctness more than for its quality.Relationships \u2014 sororal, heterosexual, professional \u2014 occupy a lot of the show. But its best mode is as a shrewd, satirical consideration of how race pollutes the workplace. Molly is an attorney, first at a corporate firm and then at a smaller, ritzy black outfit that, because it\u2019s black, is more stressfully protocol-ridden. Issa works at a nonprofit that strives to do nice stuff for black and Latino school kids between fits of self-congratulation and casual racism.It\u2019s not always clear \u2014 like in a restaurant scene between Issa and Molly in which Issa asks, \u201cSo you bloopin\u2019 and blippin\u2019 and blappin\u2019?\u201d and Molly clarifies, \u201cAnd blammin\u2019, bitch!\u201d \u2014 whether the show\u2019s satire applies to their blackness too. I expressed that at dinner and mentioned how tough a time I had believing Issa, especially, as more than a sketch of self-consciousness.Implicit in his rebuttal was pride in the righting of a wrong. Even in this so-called golden age of TV, with its proliferations of nonwhite people, queer folks and women, some of whom are running productions, a comedy by and built around black women remains anomalous. So \u201cInsecure\u201d might be too rare to dislike.The urge to protect \u201cInsecure\u201d isn\u2019t dissimilar from the one to condemn old TV, like \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cSex in the City\u201d for racism, homophobia, slut-shaming and rampant whiteness. Issa and Molly deserve to be on American television because, for so long, they weren\u2019t.We have language that helps do the sorting. A person who insults, harasses or much, much worse is \u201cproblematic,\u201d and certain \u201cproblematic\u201d people, and their work, gets \u201ccanceled.\u201d Recent cancellations include Bill Cosby, Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K., Roseanne Barr, Kanye West, Ian Buruma\u2019s stewardship of The New York Review of Books, Matt Lauer, Woody Allen, Netflix\u2019s flagrant high school satire \u201cInsatiable\u201d (but only figuratively since it has been renewed for a second season), the YouTube star Logan Paul, the Nation\u2019s poetry section. People you love but who\u2019ve misstepped are \u201cproblematic faves\u201d \u2014 Scarlett Johansson, Dave Chappelle, Cardi B, Justin Timberlake, M.I.A. \u2014 and you don\u2019t outright cancel so much as temporarily block them until they get their acts together. The people who know who\u2019s who, what\u2019s what and when\u2019s when are \u201cwoke.\u201d They tend not to be black, because black people are born woke; the trick for them is to stay that way.The nomenclature is supposed to make the moral sorting expedient. The \u201chot or not\u201d lists of yore have, more direly, become \u201cO.K./Not O.K.\u201d Individuals are not necessarily permitted a say in the cancellation \u2014 or, for that matter, in the coronation \u2014 of artists or their work. A temperature is taken and you\u2019re advised to dress accordingly. What\u2019s bad for some people is deemed bad for everybody, and some compliance is in order, lest you wind up problematic, too.That leads to something farcical like the Grammys\u2019 rumored prophylactic shunning of the popular white musician Ed Sheeran from the three biggest award categories, lest he triumph over Kendrick Lamar or Childish Gambino and cause a firestorm of upset. It leads to the Oscars now being more a moral purity contest in addition to an artistic sporting event. At awards shows, the nominated works have become referendums on the moral state of the business; their quality has become secondary. Maybe the ratings are down because no one\u2019s seen the movies and the broadcasts are too political. But maybe it\u2019s because no one wants to watch an industry prosecute itself.No event captures this anxious confusion of activism and criticism better than the time a group of artists descended upon the Whitney Museum during last year\u2019s biennial and demanded, in a protest letter, for the destruction of a painting that morally offended them. Their issue wasn\u2019t only with the painting but with the painter. Dana Schutz\u2019s \u201cOpen Casket\u201d depicted Emmett Till in a whirring rictus of earth tones. It\u2019s a vague, unsure, respectfully deferential work, different from Schutz\u2019s bigger, more dazzlingly audacious stuff. One problem, according to the protesters, was that Schutz, as a white woman, had no business painting this young black martyr. This was not, the letter argued, her story.The writer Zadie Smith spent the latter part of a rich, enfolding critical essay saying she failed to see what the protesters saw. She, too, found the inciting work underwhelming. But some readers got fixated first on Smith\u2019s being biracial, which, they argued, would make it implausible for her to relate to their protest, then on her use of the word \u201cquadroons\u201d in a hypothetical description of her children. Certain corners of Twitter erupted, both to shake their heads at Smith and to tsk her defenders. At least on the topic of \u201cOpen Casket,\u201d Zadie Smith \u2014 and her text \u2014 had been canceled. As far as her critics were concerned, she\u2019d made a moral typo. But shouldn\u2019t her puzzlement stand?A lot of this zealous police work makes sense. Groups who have been previously marginalized can now see that they don\u2019t have to remain marginal. Spending time with work that insults or alienates them has never felt acceptable. Now they can do something about it. They\u2019ve demanded to be taken seriously, and now that they kind of are, they can\u2019t not act. This territory was so hard won that it must be defended at all times, at any cost. Wrongs have to be righted. They can\u2019t affect social policy \u2014 not directly. They can, however, amend the culture. But as urgent as these correctives, cancellations, pre-emptions and proscriptions may be, they do start to take a toll. It can be hard to tell when we\u2019re consuming art and when we\u2019re conducting H.R.There were lobbying outfits \u2014 maternalistic lobbying outfits! \u2014 like Tipper Gore\u2019s Parents Music Resource Center, which released its Filthy 15 playlist (my word, not theirs, but it\u2019s not not a playlist), ultimately won warning labels for music packaging and probably wound up teaching sex ed anyway. Cyndi Lauper didn\u2019t tell 9-year-olds what a she bop was: Tipper Gore did. This was a period in which Florida ruled 2 Live Crew\u2019s album \u201cAs Nasty as They Wanna Be\u201d obscene then banned sales of it, and the Supreme Court had to tell Florida that 2 Live Crew could stay nasty. It was a period in which conservative family groups blew a gasket over the single motherhood of the fictitious Murphy Brown.[Read Christine Smallwood\u2019s magazine feature on David Wojnarowicz.]The culture wars back then always seemed to be about keeping culture from kids. Now the moral panic appears to flow in the opposite direction. The moralizers are young people, not their parents. And the fight is no longer over what we once called family values. It\u2019s for representation \u2014 seats at the cultural table on the basis of race, gender and sexuality \u2014 in museums, on television, in movies. And what\u2019s most valued is existence. And the fight is to keep that existence unobstructed.In the previous incarnation of this conflict, the prevailing mood was mockery and more boundary expansion. All kinds of artists seemed eager to tick conservatives off, while testing how free freedom of expression really was. A queer independent cinema came out of this era. There seemed to be one erotic thriller a month. Tony Kushner wrote \u201cAngels in America.\u201d Madonna happened, over and over. Andres Serrano put a crucifix in a tank of his own urine, photographed it and called it \u201cPiss Christ.\u201dThe animating crisis of that era was sex \u2014 from the paranoia, shame and judgment during the AIDS epidemic to the national cataclysm of the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal. The animating crisis of this era is power: the abuse, sharing and stripping of it. Empowerment. Art might not have the privilege of being art for art\u2019s sake anymore. It has to be art for justice\u2019s sake. Suddenly, but for very different reasons, the kinds of people who used to be subject to censorship are now the purveyors of a not-dissimilar silencing. Something generational has shifted, even among the cool kids and artsy-fartsies. Members of the old anti-censorship brigades now feel they have to censor themselves.So we wind up with safer art and discourse that provokes and disturbs and shocks less. It gives us culture whose artistic value has been replaced by moral judgment and leaves us with monocriticism. This might indeed be a kind of social justice. But it also robs us of what is messy and tense and chaotic and extrajudicial about art. It validates life while making work and conversations about that work kind of dull.Questions about representation and diversity are scarcely new. The 1970s lesbian literary journal \u201cConditions\u201d featured work that wondered how inclusive feminism really was of nonwhite women. In an eloquent elegy of the painter Horace Pippin that accompanied a long overdue 1994 show at the Museum of Modern Art, Cornel West argued that Pippin was basically too good for the \u201csterile \u2018quality vs. diversity\u2019 debate\u201d that had taken root in the museum world and hasn\u2019t really left. But what has shifted is how blindingly monolithic the thinking around representation and diversity has become.I graduated from college in the late 1990s, so I got an identity-politics education in a culture-wars climate. I learned how to read a text (a movie, a book, a painting) for both meaning and a kind of aesthetic morality. How does this film treat this woman? How does it look at her? And, as a consequence, how do we? If you read and write about enough film theory, not only do you become well versed in enough points of view on women and, I don\u2019t know, Alfred Hitchcock, you also synthesize enough of these ideas for there to be no one way to read him or his heroines. He\u2019s open, as they say, to interpretation.What rarely came up was biography. We rarely dwelled on who these artists were. We were students of the work \u2014 its devices, strategies, vision, achievements and problems. We were little deconstructionists. The makers\u2019 personal story? Their intent? Those didn\u2019t matter. The text was all. What has transpired in the past decade \u2014 the shifts in power, politics, media, higher education and economics; the calls for reckonings and representation of all sorts \u2014 might have transported us to an uneasy new place: post-text.A life of daily film criticism entails an element of judiciousness, of moral pacing. In the past, my idea of fairness, when warranted, was to wait until the end of a review to introduce a grievance of racism, misogyny, homophobia or the like. In a review from 2007 of a moist romantic drama called \u201cIn the Land of Women,\u201d I complained about the lack of young directors capable of making even incidental generational statements and pointed out (in a parenthetical) that \u201csadly, we\u2019re talking only about white males.\u201d (It didn\u2019t take long for piqued white-male mail to find my inbox.)Nobody has time to wait for the last paragraph now.I can imagine the distress of graduating from a high school or college campus in the Obama era, having missed the early culture wars but having imbibed the real possibilities of multiculturalism; having fought against hate speech and cultural appropriation and for greater emotional and atmospheric sensitivity; living in the Donald Trump era, in the #MeToo era, with \u201cHamilton\u201d on Broadway and white people more aware than ever of the totality of their whiteness, but with white nationalists on the march even as Confederate statues are being toppled. Things might truly feel apocalyptic. And a determination to stem further distress might be radicalizing.And on FX there\u2019s \u201cPose\u201d, which is set in culture-wars-era Manhattan amid an enclave of queer folks, nearly all of whom are black and Latino. It\u2019s wholly unconcerned with goodness. Nobody is pleading for you to love them. The show would be medicine if it were. Instead, it has the dramatic priorities of a 19th-century novel and the morals of a \u201cFast and Furious\u201d movie. I\u2019ve never seen a show like \u201cPose,\u201d something that feels like half a dozen decades happening at once, that has ideas (and some clunkiness) but also knows exactly what it is, what life is. I can\u2019t believe it works as well as it does. But I\u2019m also thankful that it works at all because, given the rareness of what it is, it would be terrible to have to hate it, at least out loud.Beyonc\u00e9 is, of course, the most traffic-stopping artist we have. She is also the patron saint of these \u201csshhh\u201d times. If \u201cInsecure\u201d feels too important to doubt, Beyonc\u00e9 is almost too iconic to discuss. Dare do something as simple as rank her last three albums in the \u201cwrong\u201d preferential order \u2014 \u201cLemonade,\u201d \u201cBeyonc\u00e9,\u201d then \u201c4\u201d \u2014 or wonder about the wisdom of the choreography during a tiny part of her Coachella performance last spring, and check for the Beyhive to sting up your Twitter account in her name. Other artists know this. Holding her brand-new Album of the Year Grammy last year, Adele practically groveled for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s forgiveness. \u201cLemonade\u201d was, to my ears, the best album of the five, but Adele, in addition to exuding utter earnestness in her adulation, also didn\u2019t want to get stung.An aspect of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s cultural vitality is the moral power she wields. She performs, but she also represents \u2014 as a feminist, a black person and a black woman. She operates as a solo artist but thrives in sisterhood \u2014 as a bandleader, dancer and conjurer of histories. She has come to take herself, that power and what it can do, very seriously. There is activism in her art and a real disdain, from its consumers, for critique of it. \u201cLemonade,\u201d for instance, arrived with a demand that white people refrain from commenting until black people had had their say.This version of the culture wars casts Beyonc\u00e9 as the goddess of empowerment who shan\u2019t be blasphemed. She offers herself as both deity and politician, someone here to embody and correct. That was the thrust of this summer\u2019s \u201cApeshit\u201d video, in which she, Jay-Z and some dancers took over the Louvre to practice a politics of upstaging.They positioned themselves in the space \u2014 in lines and tessellations, as statuary \u2014 so that they became the art, in a way that both made them equal to the permanent collection and rendered it secondary. The video was meant to address the relative exclusion of nonwhite artists \u2014 as creators and subjects \u2014 from that collection, while also testifying to the privilege Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z enjoy of being Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z. Here, they had committed representational vandalism: the black body as physical graffiti.That prerogative doesn\u2019t come from nowhere. Decades of music writing have been less than fair to the work of women \u2014 especially black women. So the aversion to criticism of Beyonc\u00e9 has a ring of historical justice. Her people won\u2019t let you disrespect her. But this is artistry robust enough to withstand \u2014 and be illuminated by \u2014 serious criticism. Yet she rarely receives much. The imagery gets inspected for its allusions even though there\u2019s a lot more to her work than whom it\u2019s channeling, although some of what\u2019s ingenious about, say, that Coachella performance really is the grandeur of all that it synthesizes. I tend to have little if anything bad to say about her. But criticism isn\u2019t about saying what\u2019s bad \u2014 well, not only. It\u2019s partly about situating a work in the world, in your feelings, in your collection. It can take any form and go to any place, the very surprising places an artist like Beyonc\u00e9 typically tries to take us. Not everybody has to like being there, and saying so shouldn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re risking your life.The risk should come from the art itself, the discomfort it can produce and whether it can transcend that discomfort. Avoiding that unpleasantness feels natural, but it denies a truth in art, which is our humanity \u2014 all of it. Take the most effective sequence \u2014 the only one, really \u2014 in Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d: a double viewing of \u201cThe Birth of a Nation\u201d that splits the screen between white supremacists and black activists. It\u2019s as intelligent and rousing an argument for engagement with unpleasant art as I\u2019ve seen in a movie.Out of curiosity, I recently asked some people in my life for a work of art that \u201cmorally upset\u201d them. The wording was vague enough to mean anything. So I got a little of everything: \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s,\u201d \u201cLolita,\u201d \u201cDisgrace,\u201d the paintings of Balthus, \u201cDirty Harry,\u201d \u201cPlaces in the Heart,\u201d \u201cAunt Dan and Lemon,\u201d Guns N\u2019 Roses\u2019s \u201cUsed to Love Her,\u201d \u201cLast Tango in Paris,\u201d the music of N.W.A., the films of Leni Riefenstahl, the art of Anibal Lopez, Santiago Sierra and Teresa Margolles. Some people explained their choice and made a point of clarifying that its being upsetting was a condition of the art itself.But they didn\u2019t clarify what I was looking for in asking. The controversies surrounding most of what\u2019s on that list had been settled, but I was looking for something rawer \u2014 something that started innocent but had become morally upsetting, and because it\u2019s morally upsetting maybe had to go. I guess what I was looking for was \u201cThe Cosby Show.\u201dMy mind went there because somehow I find it more difficult than, say, the rape sequence in the middle of Gaspar No\u00e9\u2019s \u201cIrreversible,\u201d which has always felt morally reprehensible rather than merely upsetting. No\u00e9 was cruising for shock. Since 60 women have accused Cosby of sexual assault, among other things, \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d has had trauma visited upon it. Over the past two years, I\u2019ve gone back and forth about how to handle that trauma. Parting with the show felt like the moral thing to do, out of respect for the women he has allegedly abused. Who is served by keeping it around? There is, after all, so much other stuff to watch and read.Cosby has been sentenced to three to 10 years for sexually assaulting Andrea Constand. And his cultural demise redoubled devotion to \u201cA Different World,\u201d which hails from the Cosby universe but doesn\u2019t involve him. But loving \u201cA Different World\u201d feels easy. And I don\u2019t know that I want easy. Besides, the culture didn\u2019t actually make \u201cThe Cosby Show\u201d go away. Corporations made a choice for us \u2014 a moral choice \u2014 by erasing it from all platforms. But the show is innocent of Cosby\u2019s crimes.The show predicted the cultural climate we\u2019re in now \u2014 America as some fantasy of itself, yet also a place where black people were obviously black and more obviously people, a representation of life rather than imitation of it, comedy that made some of us us. It was pop entertainment, a parenting guide and an essential, unprecedented feat of folk art, and now the River Styx runs through the living room. But the show wasn\u2019t like one of those downed Confederate statues, a tribute erected and defended in cynicism and bad faith. It was called \u201cThe Cosby Show,\u201d but it was never really only his (there are lots of unpaid actors and crew members who can attest to that). Those 6,000 or so hours belong as much to the culture and country as they ever did to him. He canceled himself. He was never the show\u2019s legacy. That was always going to be us.Wesley Morris is a staff writer for the magazine, a critic at large for The New York Times and a co-host of the podcast \u201cStill Processing.\u201d His last feature for the magazine was a profile of Jordan Peele.Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 3, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 4, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Oct. 5, 2018Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018The Haunting of Hill House,\u2019 on Netflix, Is a Family Drama With Scares", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookShirley Jackson was a writer who understood that good scares come to those who wait, but she also knew how to get to the point.The new Netflix series \u201cThe Haunting of Hill House\u201d \u2014 a loose adaptation that ambitiously marries the terrors of a ghost story with an intricate, multigenerational family drama \u2014 opens with a reading of this passage, which suggests fealty to source material. But if you listen closely, you might notice that the perspective has radically shifted, away from the book\u2019s omniscient narrator and toward the man speaking.That man is Steven Crain (Michiel Huisman), who wrote a best-selling book based on his family\u2019s experience in a haunted house. He called it \u201cThe Haunting of Hill House.\u201dIn just its first few seconds, this series pays homage to Shirley Jackson while erasing her at the same time, an apt analogy for this entire enterprise that should delight and frustrate horror fans in equal measure. Jackson makes a return of sorts in the next episode, in the form of a girl in the background reading Jackson\u2019s short story \u201cThe Lottery.\u201d A world in which Jackson wrote \u201cThe Lottery\u201d but not \u201cThe Haunting of Hill House\u201d makes no sense, but when it comes to tales of the supernatural, a rigid adherence to logic is distinctly overrated.Every adaptation of a great horror story implicitly attempts to answer the same question: What part of this source material is the scariest?As much as he revered the book and the movie, King was skeptical of their extreme discretion \u2014 he called it playing for the tie rather than the win \u2014 and as horror became blunter and special effects and makeup more sophisticated, it became harder to keep monsters in the closet.Mike Flanagan, who created the Netflix show and directed every episode, went in a completely different direction. While his series is by no means full of gore, he shows plenty of the supernatural, introducing some very spooky ghosts including a bent-necked woman and an extremely tall floater in a bowler hat. And more riskily, he strays farther from Hill House than previous adaptations do, which sacrifices some of the claustrophobia that a good haunted house story can generate.Hill House is constantly anthropomorphized in the book, but instead of using design to show it to us, Flanagan has a character deliver a long monologue about how the house is like a body. It\u2019s striking that the best episode of the series takes place outside of Hill House and in a funeral parlor, and it unfolds almost entirely through a few virtuosic tracking shots.Instead of telling the story from the book about a group of strangers who are invited to the house by a doctor to study the supernatural, the series dispenses with this medical conceit and focuses on the dysfunctional relationships in a family who once stayed in Hill House. That family, a couple (Carla Gugino, Henry Thomas) with five children, moved into the house in order to renovate and flip it. Instead of making a profit, they paid dearly, and what happened in the house haunts each child through adulthood.Its fractured plot, darting back and forth from childhood to adulthood, underlines how horrific events lodge themselves in your psyche. Early on, we see the father frantic, gathering his kids and fleeing to a hotel. Whatever happened that night hangs over all 10 episodes, and before revealing it, Flanagan shows how the past haunts the present.The worst fear in this \u201cHill House\u201d is not walking alone, but with your relatives. Steven Crain writes a tell-all book that makes him famous, but it also divides the family because his sister Shirley (Elizabeth Reaser) thinks he is exploiting family tragedy. Theodora (Kate Siegel) works as a child psychologist, which also brings up gothic memories, and Luke (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) struggles with addiction. The most rattled child might be Nell (Victoria Pedretti), whose fragile state echoes that of Eleanor Vance from the original book and leads her back to Hill House and a reunion of the whole family. (Timothy Hutton plays the older version of the Crain patriarch.)For horror \u2014 which has a tradition of thinly drawn victims and wildly evocative monsters, and of isolating people in space or in cabins in the woods instead of moving them around in dense narratives \u2014 this is a ton of plot, not to mention the many long theatrical speeches. And Flanagan has woven it together cleverly, with winks at fans of the original story and surprising bits of connective tissue across generations. It\u2019s an intricate, emotionally gripping and sprawling story, but its scale does seem to come at the expense of scares.The major turning points in the series hinge on familial lies, odd coincidence and decisions that are the stuff of midlife crisis novels set in the suburbs of Connecticut, not gothic tales of the uncanny. If it weren\u2019t for the periodic bug crawling out of a corpse\u2019s mouth or a floating ghost peering underneath a child\u2019s bed, you could confuse \u201cThe Haunting of Hill House\u201d for a kitchen-sink drama. For those worried that horror has become so sober and mature that it is losing some of its fun, there is some evidence to found in this solemnly affecting series.The biggest challenge for horror in the age of streaming might be pacing. Getting this right is as important in scary scenes as it is in jokes. This series is deliberate and slow, but it conforms to traditional episodic television structure. Episodes start and end with shocks, and while they are often quite effective, the scares don\u2019t escalate. Flanagan has made an intelligent, engaging supernatural story in which the tension doesn\u2019t mount so much as stop and start, and occasionally sputter.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Offering Inspiration and Advice, Real Vision Is HGTV for Hedge Fund Hopefuls", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byKieran O\u2019Dea rises at 5 a.m. to begin his daily routine, shuffling to his desk to eye his portfolio: a cluster of biotechnology stocks and a bet that Tesla will go bust.His office consists of an unmade bed, two computer screens and a stunning view of Long Island Sound. Mr. O\u2019Dea may be master of his own hedge fund, but he could not be more disconnected from the Wall Street machine. No sell-side research clogs his inbox. He does not own a Bloomberg terminal. And there is no TV tuned to CNBC, the financial news hub ubiquitous on trading floors.\u201cI hardly watch it \u2014 and I don\u2019t have access to any of that other stuff, either,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cI get all my market access from Twitter and Real Vision.\u201dReal Vision offers a way to skip the traditional hedge fund path: slog away at an investment bank or a mutual fund, then settle down in Midtown Manhattan or Greenwich, Conn. For a modest fee, Real Vision will connect investors to a network of elite Wall Street analysts, traders and hedge fund managers, making it easier for novices like Mr. O\u2019Dea to jump the line.Raoul Pal, a former hedge fund executive who also worked at Goldman Sachs and runs an investment strategy service called Global Macro Investor, co-founded Real Vision. Since then, 20,000 people have signed up, paying $180 a year to hear directly from financial insiders.Real Vision also celebrates the hedge fund life \u2014 the outsize trades, houses and swagger \u2014 and tempts aspirants like Mr. O\u2019Dea into thinking that they, too, might join the club.It is a world that Mr. Pal, who earlier in his career pitched ideas to luminaries like Paul Tudor Jones and George Soros, knows well. He said he was motivated to start Real Vision after watching CNBC\u2019s coverage of the financial crisis and thinking there was an opening for deep dives into finance\u2019s most arcane areas.\u201cThe media was too busy treating finance as entertainment and sound bites,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are going to cheerlead while this thing is going up, you have to warn them of the risks. It is a moral obligation.\u201dBut there\u2019s still an element of theater to Real Vision. Recently, Mr. Pal interviewed Michael Novogratz, a billionaire investor specializing in cryptocurrencies, in his office. During the discussion on the ups and downs of Bitcoin, Mr. Novogratz wore pink jeans that matched his sneakers and took a seat in front of an original leather jumpsuit worn by the motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel, standing in a glass case under neon lights.Mr. Pal had flown in from his home in the Cayman Islands, and he displayed an untucked shirt, sneakers without socks and a stubble beard. It could well have been a scene from \u201cBillions,\u201d the television show about the machinations and appetites of hedge fund titans.\u201cI used to think that these guys were gods,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cBut if you spend enough time watching them, you can figure out what they are up to.\u201dAnd if his formative experience was being a world-ranked video game player \u2014 in both World of Warcraft and Smite, he said \u2014 not a striving investment banker, so what? Mr. O\u2019Dea watched the best gamers as he honed his craft once before. How hard could it be?\u201cIt has been my total school \u2014 I mean, I had no idea what a bear market or a bull market was when I started,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cIt was like watching people play video games.\u201dCurrently, 9,790 hedge funds are plying their trade, according to HFR, an industry tracker. With so many options, the pressure to perform has never been greater.The last time hedge funds collectively beat the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was 2008. So far this year, Hedge Knight is up 37 percent Mr. O\u2019Dea said, soundly beating the index\u2019s 9 percent increase and thrashing the near-flat return the fund\u2019s peer group has delivered.Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s grandfather Leonard E. Baum was Hedge Knight\u2019s main financial backer until his death. Propped up against Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s window is a faded photograph of Mr. Baum, a mathematician who put in place the trading framework that James H. Simons, the founder of Renaissance Technologies, employed to make his $84 billion Medallion Fund one of the world\u2019s most successful hedge funds. Sitting in a lawn chair, Mr. Baum has his toddler grandson in a tight hug.If his grandfather was Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s main source of capital, Real Vision is his source of inspiration.In the video, Mr. Hart wears his hair slicked back and spins tales of accumulating art, becoming an expert in Brazilian jujitsu and living in the moment \u2014 what he refers to as \u201cchasing flow.\u201d\u201cI wanted to be that guy,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea recalled.He made a pilgrimage to Texas to meet Mr. Hart, and they bonded over biotechnology companies. Mr. O\u2019Dea was curious about the science of disease: His grandfather suffered from cone-rod dystrophy, a condition that erodes vision, and his younger brother Brennan \u2014 the only other employee at Hedge Knight \u2014 is afflicted with over a half-dozen autoimmune illnesses. Brennan O\u2019Dea spends nine months a year in a small cabin in Idaho, studying biology and scanning the market for cutting-edge companies. He has selected all 12 biotech stocks in Hedge Knight\u2019s portfolio.Real Vision has plenty of believers.\u201cI have been a subscriber since they were two months old,\u201d said Chase Taylor, 35, an Air Force officer whose dream is to sell investment research to hedge funds.He has not worked in the industry, nor did he go to business school. \u201cI figured if these guys are doing it, I can too,\u201d he said.When Mr. Pal told subscribers in early 2017 that he was raising $7 million from outside investors, 1,700 offered to invest. He ultimately increased the sum to $10 million, and 50 subscribers became shareholders, although neither Mr. O\u2019Dea nor Mr. Taylor is among them.Take Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s fund: a dozen biotechnology stocks, some with values below $50 million, and a bet that Tesla goes bankrupt. It is a very risky portfolio, especially for a manager with such limited experience.Real Vision is careful to present its strategies as trading ideas \u2014 not recommendations. At the end of each video, an employee warns investors to weigh their risk appetite before jumping in.Ultimately, Mr. O\u2019Dea\u2019s contention that in finance \u2014 as with video games \u2014 you can ascend to an elite level by scrutinizing what the best players do remains unproven.Which does not mean he won\u2019t give it a shot.\u201cNow, I know what I am doing,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Dea said. \u201cAnd guess what: I am a 29-year-old hedge fund manager.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u2019 Pits Teenage Rage Against Dark Magic", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d is frequently chilling, but it\u2019s rarely much of an adventure. Netflix\u2019s new spin on the lore of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, starring Kiernan Shipka (\u201cMad Men\u201d) as our spooky heroine, gets off to a spellbinding start, but over 10 episodes becomes more toil and trouble than it\u2019s worth.When we meet Sabrina Spellman, she\u2019s carefully crossing days off her calendar, leading to the date where she\u2019s written \u201c16th birthday\u201d and, just underneath that, \u201cdark baptism.\u201d It\u2019s hard being a teenager these days. Or whatever days \u201cSabrina\u201d is set in: The show has a \u201950s retro aesthetic, from the cars to the crinoline, but modern sensibilities about feminism, gender expression and the costs of serving as Satan\u2019s handmaid.The Devil isn\u2019t just in the details here; he\u2019s everywhere, with his clomping hooves and goat head, wreaking gruesome havoc and dispatching his servants to torture and coerce Sabrina into falling in line. But Sabrina doesn\u2019t want to submit to baptism, and she doesn\u2019t want to sign her life over to the Dark Lord. She wants to stay in the ordinary world, alongside her doting boyfriend, Harvey (Ross Lynch), and her spunky besties, Roz (Jaz Sinclair) and Susie (Lachlan Watson). Once you enlist in Satan\u2019s service, you can\u2019t have silly sleepovers anymore.Sabrina is half witch, half \u201cmortal\u201d \u2014 her father was a powerful warlock and her mother a regular human, and since they died, Sabrina has been raised by her witch aunts (Lucy Davis and Miranda Otto) in a musty funeral home. They\u2019re insistent that she do right by the Spellman family name and give herself, body and soul, to the Church of Night.Like any teenage hero, Sabrina would rather do things her way. \u201cI want freedom and power,\u201d she pleads. Too bad, toots \u2014 it\u2019s a man\u2019s world out there, and shivering teenage virgins kneeling in their white slips while powerful older men anoint their foreheads with blood is just how things go.That ritual, with a vulnerable Sabrina quivering in fear while surrounded by eerie witch folk, is but one gorgeous tableau. As with many modern series, the show is often literally too dark to see what\u2019s happening. But in the rare moments of (again, actual) illumination, it\u2019s as rich as an oil painting, with Shipka practically glowing.The constant haze and unnatural color palette make \u201cSabrina\u201d a dead ringer for CW\u2019s murder-soaked spin on the Archie comics \u201cRiverdale,\u201d which is no surprise. The Sabrina character is part of the greater Archie universe, and the two shows share a creator, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. In all the ways that \u201cRiverdale\u201d turns Archie and the gang into \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d Junior, \u201cThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d is more like \u201cTrue Blood\u201d For teenagers, with a parade of supernatural entities and an overpresent mythology that threatens to bleed the joy out of the storytelling.Like most Netflix originals, \u201cThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d is the wrong number of episodes. It could have been a taut and thrilling shorter series, or a set-\u2019em-up, knock-\u2019em-down occult procedural like \u201cSupernatural.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s not quite either, and it burns through its most interesting parts while stalling out during its dullest.Sabrina triumphs over bullies and monsters and misogynists, with maggot-filled apples littering her path, but the series gets repetitive. After a while, determined women shouting Latin incantations while scowling at the camera starts to feel like Harry Potter runoff. The obstacles are too familiar and too pat, and no one is ever really a match for Sabrina\u2019s derring-do.When it\u2019s humming along, though, \u201cSabrina\u201d is a blast. It\u2019s a horror show, with demons galore and a threatening posse of young witches who dress alike and move in an undulating herd. It knows what \u201cThe Craft\u201d knew, which is that teenage girl rage is a powerful force.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Kiernan Shipka Gets a Tarot Card Reading. It\u2019s Mostly Good News.", "Date": "2018-10-20", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe former \u201cMad Men\u201d child actor plays a teenage witch in Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.\u201d Mr. Scoroposki sat opposite her on a matching couch. Between them was a carved wooden table covered with crystals and a hand-drawn diagram of her astrological chart.Still Mr. Scoroposki did foresee some hiccups on the horizon. He leaned in, eyebrow cocked. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about your love life,\u201d he said.\u201cOh, I do need to know about that,\u201d Ms. Shipka said, eyes wide and nodding vigorously.\u201cI figured,\u201d he said with concern, which prompted Ms. Shipka, who turns 19 in November (she\u2019s a Sagittarius), to let out a gleeful cackle befitting, well, a teenage witch.Romantic uncertainty aside, this is an exciting moment for Ms. Shipka, who is stepping into her first big leading role, and it\u2019s a juicy one. She plays Sabrina Spellman, in a reimagining of the 1990s sitcom about a half-witch, half-mortal high school student juggling homework, a boyfriend and a demon overlord keen on possessing her soul. You know, typical teenage stuff.Like that show, \u201cSabrina\u201d places adolescent melodrama in a supernatural milieu, drawing parallels between everyday teenage antics and otherworldly horrors.There are also social overtones. \u201cSabrina\u201d invokes witches as a metaphor for womanhood, and the challenges that girls and women face in a male-dominated world. \u201cI loved the feminist quality of it,\u201d Ms. Shipka said.\u201cWitches are such a thing right now, aren\u2019t they?\u201d she added. \u201cI think it\u2019s interesting how we keep returning to them time and time again. This feels like a very current take on the whole idea. What I like about the show is that it simultaneously feels like an escape but also a commentary.\u201dThe role of Sabrina, with all its layers and contradictions, was also an exciting challenge. \u201cThe way that her character is so multidimensional and still so young, but driven and smart, brave and selfless at the same time,\u201d Ms. Shipka said. \u201cThat was really fascinating to me.\u201dMs. Shipka could have been talking about herself. With her wavy blond bob, sleeveless white Miu Miu shirt, slim black pants and velvet fanny pack, she cut a professional yet playful look.\u201cYoung people deserve to be portrayed with depth,\u201d she said.Did she have an early inkling that the show would change her life? \u201cOh, never. I had no expectations whatsoever,\u201d she said. \u201cI remember leaving the first day of set, and my dad was like, \u2018This seems pretty legit.\u2019\u201dMaybe because she has spent so much of her life in the public eye, and in the company of adults, it\u2019s no surprise that, in person she comes across as preternaturally poised. Her smile radiates genuine warmth and she has no hang up about hugging a reporter upon first meeting.At the astrological reading, Mr. Scoroposki explained that Venus had gone into retrograde, causing a summertime romance to go haywire. \u201cIf you\u2019re wondering what the hell happened, just remember that this, too, shall pass,\u201d he said. \u201cUse this time to reflect and think: \u2018What do I really want? What do I deserve?\u2019\u201dNext, Mr. Scoroposki consulted his tarot cards and had Ms. Shipka shuffle the deck. A recurring card was the King of Wands, which again alluded to the fading dalliance. \u201cThis is telling me you\u2019re right to think, \u2018Oh wait, there\u2019s some sort of imbalance here,\u2019\u201d he said. However, he did see that Jupiter was entering her sign, Sagittarius, for a year, which meant it was a prime time to focus her energies on work.Ms. Shipka seemed to recognize that analysis, nodding profusely.Ms. Shipka was tight on time. She was due at Comic Con later that day, and had only 30 minutes to spare. As Mr. Scoroposki wrapped up his reading, he welcomed Ms. Shipka to come back or call for a check-in. He also gave her a lapis crystal. \u201cIt\u2019s sacred to Jupiter,\u201d he said. \u201cCarry it with you.\u201dDid he have any parting tips? \u201cGo on hikes, get out in nature, be active,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019ll be good for you.\u201dMs. Shipka saw plenty of opportunity for outdoor adventures in Vancouver, where the show is filmed. She also keeps a small trampoline on set to help her stay active and shake off excess energy between scenes.Lapis in hand, Ms. Shipka made her way downstairs and stepped out onto the sun-dappled sidewalk. She glowed with post-reading positive vibes, and if she was at all troubled about the news about her love life, it didn\u2019t show.\u201cOh, I love my Raya,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve gone on dates from it, but nothing that\u2019s come to fruition.

{"Headline": "An Election About Everything", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn Politics With Lisa LererHi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.In 2014, pundits, strategists and reporters dubbed the midterms the \u201cSeinfeld election\u201d \u2014 as in, an election about nothing.Those midterms, the thinking went, had no overriding theme, no sweeping Democratic plan for the middle class, no big G.O.P. proposal to slash spending.Four years later, the exact opposite feels true: President Trump has turned 2018 into an unpredictable, and often uncomfortable, election about the most divisive issues in American life.The past two weeks have only served to underscore that intensity.Traditionally, this kind of unrest should play to Republicans, who have long positioned themselves as the party of law and order. And, typically, the incumbent party benefits during national crises.But that\u2019s assuming the White House is handling the sense of anxiety in a unifying way. In the 48 hours after the synagogue shooting, Mr. Trump did not do any of the things Americans expect of their presidents in these kind of moments. He did not deliver an address calling for harmony, meet with faith leaders, introduce new policies or console the victims. In fact, he didn\u2019t even pause his campaign, the standard response to tragedy.On Monday afternoon, the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced that Mr. Trump and his wife would travel to Pittsburgh to meet with the Jewish community \u2014 but she blamed the media for the toxic political climate that led to the attack.That leaves us in fairly uncharted waters, politically. It\u2019s part of the reason that strategists from both parties are urging candidates to stick to their messages.In Houston, Democratic volunteers told our Texas correspondent, Manny Fernandez, that recent events have been a source of sadness, anger and what one volunteer described as \u201crenewing the spirit to work harder.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s instilling a very strong sense of urgency, that we must have leaders who symbolize respect, integrity and honesty,\u201d said Nancy Nichols, a volunteer for the Democratic Senate candidate Beto O\u2019Rourke in the East Texas city of Tyler.But will these past few weeks drive even more Democrats to the polls? Or remind those all-important suburban women of the kind of divisive rhetoric they don\u2019t particularly like to hear from the president? Or convince Republicans that the president is being treated unfairly by the media?____________________If Texas ever turns blue, the Texas Organizing Project \u2014 or TOP \u2014 will almost certainly have something to do with it.Last month I visited their Dallas headquarters, a bare-bones office in a strip mall off an expressway. I was curious to learn more about their efforts to turn out low-income voters in neighborhoods that have become disenfranchised \u2014 areas politicians avoid because of their low turnout, making residents even less inclined to vote, until whole communities are left out of politics altogether.What does that mission look like up close? The day I arrived, about 80 people in blue T-shirts sat in chairs, listening to a pep talk before heading out to knock on doors. Many of them had found their way to TOP through fliers that advertised $15-an-hour work. But once they were hired, trainers underscored a sense of political urgency and possibility.\u201cWe\u2019re knocking on doors of people that look just like us,\u201d a man told the group. \u201cEvery conversation matters. This is not just a job.\u201dIt usually takes three connections \u2014 a door knock, a call and an offer of a ride to the polls \u2014 to make sure a low-frequency voter actually casts a ballot.In a small nearby room, Shetamia Taylor, a charismatic canvas manager, called on people to practice their scripts, giving pointers about how to generate rapport. Listening was key. Only after a conversation, she said, did you tell voters that \u201cBeto O\u2019Rouke understands the issues,\u201d or that John Creuzot, a district attorney candidate, is \u201con our side.\u201dA paper on the wall reminds Ms. Taylor\u2019s group of their goals over the next two weeks: knock on 8,905 doors; get 1,188 commitments to vote. They are but one piece of a much larger project that aims to reach 72,000 doors in Dallas County before the midterm election, in order to turn out 26,000 infrequent voters.To organizers like Kimberly Olsen, the political field director who helped establish the organization, turning Texas blue is not a mysterious or elusive goal. It simply boils down to math. This year, she said, the numbers may not add up for Democrats outside of the big cities. But someday they could get there.\u201cWe need to be in nine counties,\u201d Ms. Olsen said. \u201cRight now, we\u2019re in three.\u201d____________________In the last few weeks, we\u2019ve polled 14 of the 29 G.O.P.-held districts that are rated as tossups by the Cook Political Report. The average result is a tie. For 10 of the 14, the margin is one percentage point or less.You can see all our polling here._________________________________________________________________________________Thanks for reading.

{"Headline": "How Carrie Mae Weems Rewrote the Rules of Image-Making", "Date": "2018-10-15", "News": "Perhaps our best contemporary photographer, she creates work that insists on the worth of black women \u2014 both in art and in life.Supported byBut first, she wants to show me her peonies. A few weeks before we meet, she emailed me a JPEG of a flower in full bloom, a still-life hello. Frothy white with a bright yellow center, it wasn\u2019t just any peony, but the W.E.B. DuBois peony, which was named for the civil rights activist after Weems called up the American Peony Society with the suggestion. (As she tells it, they happened to have a new variety in need of a name.) The flower was to be the centerpiece of a memorial garden for DuBois at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst \u2014 a small but characteristically thoughtful gesture from an artist who has made her career creating spaces for contemplation in the place of absence, rooting a troubled present in a painful past with projects that feel resolutely forward-looking and idealistic.Canonical, yes \u2014 and yet, in many ways, it feels we barely know her apart from the persona we see in her work, in which she often appears, staring down the camera lens, or with her back turned to it, inviting us to see things through her eyes. She\u2019s as arresting a presence in real life. In conversation, she has a magnetism that\u2019s almost planetary; she is mellifluously voiced and funny, with a habit of repeating \u201cRight? Right?\u201d as she makes her points, which move from critical theory to an anecdote about her Pilates teacher, who tried to break up with Weems because she was too demanding. She\u2019s like that friend who sees right through you and who you trust will set you straight, because she\u2019s just as undeluded about herself.Her photographs and short films, as gimlet-eyed and gutsy as they are visually compelling, have gone a long way toward resetting our expectations of pictures and challenging our assumptions about her largely African-American subjects. A gifted storyteller who works accessibly in text and image, she\u2019s created new narratives around women, people of color and working-class communities, conjuring lush art from the arid polemics of identity. The desire to create images has never not felt powerful, something Weems understood from the first time she held her own camera. She was 20, and it was a birthday present from her boyfriend, Raymond, a Marxist and labor organizer. \u201cI think that the first time I picked up that camera, I thought, \u2018Oh, O.K. This is my tool. This is it,\u2019 \u201d she tells me.OVER THE LAST two years, even those of us who might have once been able to delude ourselves into thinking that structures of power don\u2019t really affect us have been made to see otherwise. For Weems, who grew up in one of the few black families in Portland, the child of a large (she is the second of seven children), close-knit family of sharecroppers who had migrated from Mississippi, that was never the case. Her paternal grandfather had organized tenant farmers on the Sunshine Plantation, one of Mississippi\u2019s first cooperative farms with black and white farmers; Dorothea Lange, she recently discovered, photographed her favorite uncle, Clarence, in the 1930s. Weems\u2019s childhood was a very happy one, filled with caravan trips to the beach and Mount Hood. It was defined in large part by two men: her handsome father, Myrlie, who she says resembled Muhammad Ali \u2014 \u201che was just a really charismatic kind of guy, funny and wonderful and warm, polite, open\u201d \u2014 and her maternal grandfather, who employed most of the family. \u201cHe was Jewish, Native American and black, but looked very Jewish, and he knew that basically he was passing for white and that he could do things that we couldn\u2019t so easily. So he used all of that to make sure that his family was taken care of.\u201d He ran a janitorial service and later owned a popular barbecue restaurant.Weems was 8 when her parents divorced, and because the family remained in some ways intact \u2014 her father lived around the corner \u2014 she told herself for many years that it hadn\u2019t affected her. It was only years later, while talking to one of her aunts, that she realized the divorce marked the point at which she\u2019d stopped drawing and painting. Other memories of that time in her youth have come back, too: of arriving home from school to find her mother weeping in front of the television after Kennedy was shot; of reading Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech over and over again with her father, following King\u2019s assassination.Over the years, Weems has revisited in her work the age she was then \u2014 8, 9, 10, a girl still in the process of becoming herself, with a dawning adult awareness of the world and a self-assurance made all the more poignant with the knowledge that it won\u2019t survive adolescence wholly intact. A 1978 portrait of her daughter, Faith, at 9, is radiant with Faith\u2019s innocence and Weems\u2019s love. A nostalgic 2002 image, \u201cMay Flowers,\u201d hangs prominently on the wall in Weems\u2019s home. It depicts three girls at that age dressed in vintage dresses and flower crowns. The girl in the center, whose name, Weems tells me, is Jessica \u2014 Weems noticed her on the streets of Syracuse with her mother and approached them to ask if Jessica might model for her \u2014 looks directly out at us, warily, fearlessly. It is, like much of Weems\u2019s work, a kind of slanted self-portrait.After her parents\u2019 divorce, Weems moved with her mother and siblings into a large house owned by her grandfather. She would pirouette down the long wood-floored hallway and look out the attic windows, wearing her mother\u2019s work smock, imagining she was a dancer or an actress. \u201cI was simply becoming interested in this idea of being an artist in the world in some sort of way, not knowing really what the arts were,\u201d she says. \u201cI had these great, grand visions that I would move to New York City and that I would always arrive fabulously dressed, and I would always arrive late, and I would always leave early and everybody would want to know who I was. \u2018Who is she?\u2019 That was my fantasy.\u201d After a visit from her drama teacher, her mother agreed to send her to a summer program in Shakespearean theater, freeing her from having to earn money by picking strawberries with the other kids in her neighborhood \u2014 giving her permission, essentially, to create. The program led her to other opportunities in theater and street performance, \u201cdancing at the crossroads at night to bring up the gods,\u201d she tells me.Her father gave her another, equally crucial kind of permission. \u201cMy earliest memories are of my father picking me up and setting me on his knee. I was about 4 or 5. He looked at me, and he said, \u2018Carrie Mae, always remember that you have a right. Right? That no matter who messes with you, you pick up the biggest stick that you can, and you fight back with it.\u2019 This was a great gift. He would say, \u2018There\u2019s no man greater than you. You are greater than no other man.\u2019 This is the bedrock of my understanding, the bedrock of my belief system that really was instilled very, very early in my life, and repeated throughout my life, this idea that we had a right to be there. So, if I arrive at some sort of big, fancy gala, I always feel really comfortable. It just doesn\u2019t really matter who is in the room.\u201dBut equally, if not more essential, was a different, more intuitive kind of education gleaned from self-study, reading and youthful misadventures, including a memorable trip to East Berlin where she was mistaken for Angela Davis. Weems first moved to New York in 1971 \u201cwith a baby on my back and a cardboard suitcase,\u201d as she puts it, only to return quickly to San Francisco. It was too soon; she needed work and child care. Faith, who was born when Weems was 16, was raised mostly by Weems\u2019s aunt and uncle. Weems and Faith are very close (they vacation together in Martha\u2019s Vineyard), and a handful of Weems\u2019s pictures are nearly definitive artistic representations of motherhood \u2014 the emotional intensity, the moments of ambivalence \u2014 but she doesn\u2019t see the subject as central to her work. \u201cI\u2019ve never really been a real mother,\u201d she says. \u201cI think my daughter and I are more friends. Of course, there\u2019s an element of mother and daughter, but because I didn\u2019t raise her, we have a very different kind of relationship.\u201dLooking through the Black Photographers Annual, she saw her future in artists \u2014 mostly men \u2014 who looked like her, who were doing the kind of work she wanted to be doing, and in 1976, she tried New York again. \u201cI came to New York to be with them, to see them, to talk to them, to interview them, to study with them, to become their friends, to see their exhibitions,\u201d she remembers. While studying photography at the Studio Museum in Harlem, she made money as a Kelly Girl \u2014 a kind of temp worker \u2014 and later as an assistant to the photographer Anthony Barboza. She found a community in the Kamoinge Workshop, an organization of black photographers, and a friend and mentor in the photographer Dawoud Bey, who taught her at the Studio Museum, and who recalls her \u201chumility and passion\u201d as a student. Both were influenced by Roy DeCarava\u2019s images, which merged rigorous craft and \u201cthe lives of ordinary black folk,\u201d Bey says. \u201cWe also both shared a sense that our very presence in the world, as human beings who were also black, demanded that we live lives and make work that somehow made a difference, that left the world transformed in some way, and that visualized a piece of that world that was uniquely ours and that participated in a larger cultural conversation inside of the medium of photography.\u201dShe was teaching at Hampshire College in Massachusetts in the late 1980s when her concern became impossible to ignore. \u201cI always had an exercise in self-portraiture in my classes. Invariably, all of the female students were in some way covered. They were always slightly behind the thing, whether it was their hair or an object or a piece of clothing,\u201d she says, raising her hands in a gesture of coy femininity to her face. \u201cThey were always sort of hidden. They were never square. They were always doing something to obscure the clarity of themselves. Because women were always sort of interested in being objects, because we\u2019ve been trained to be objects. We\u2019ve been trained to be desirous in some sort of way, to present ourselves in that sort of way.\u201dIn \u201cThe Kitchen Table Series,\u201d Weems stares out at us in a way that insists we not simply look at her but really see her \u2014 a charged exchange, but also a beautifully leveling one: Here we are, human to human, across the table from one another. She plays a character: friend, parent, breadwinner, lover, a woman who resists classification, a woman of the world, of political conscience. These are roles that transcend race, but behind her, on her wall, we see a photograph of Malcolm X, his fist upraised, reminding us of an inescapable precedent of imagery, of a larger conversation that black women had been missing from.As Weems tells it, the idea of making a series of tableaux vivants about a woman\u2019s life began with an evening with a man and a chance shot at her kitchen table, the expository triangle of light demarcating a kind of domestic stage. In 1989 and 1990, she worked on it obsessively. The narrative, which explores the life cycle of a romance, unfolds over nearly two dozen photographs and accompanying text panels. In one panel, she writes, \u201cIn and of itself, being alone again naturally wasn\u2019t a problem. But some time had passed. At 38 she was beginning to feel the fullness of her woman self, wanted once again to share it all with a man who could deal with the multitude of her being.\u201d In the final image, she\u2019s playing solitaire.\u201c\u2018Kitchen Table\u2019 is about really unpacking these relationships, about unpacking monogamy, the difficulty of monogamy, the trumped-upness of monogamy, this sort of ideal that never seems to pan out,\u201d Weems explains. \u201cLife is pretty messy stuff. Can we use this space, this common space known around the world, to shine a light on what happens in a family, how it stays together and how it falls apart? What women have to be and what men have to be, because you\u2019re always struggling for equilibrium. Somebody always has the upper hand. Every once in a while you get stasis. If you\u2019re lucky.\u201dAs if on cue, Weems\u2019s husband arrives at home and comes out to say hello. They first met in 1986, in the darkroom at the Visual Studies Workshop, where she had a residency. She had seen his name on an announcement for a black caucus in support of the Society for Photographic Education. \u201cI was like, \u2018Hmm, Jeff Hoone, that\u2019s an interesting name for a brother. I don\u2019t know any brothers named Hoone.\u2019 So I wrote him this note, thinking that he was a black man: \u2018It\u2019s very nice to know that a brother is in charge over there, running this organization at Syracuse University.\u2019 \u201d A mutual friend told her he would be stopping by the darkroom that day. \u201cAnd Jeff walked in, and I was a little taken aback. I think I was probably embarrassed because of the letter that I had written. He walked in, and I looked at him, and I thought, \u2018Oh my God. This is going to be my husband.\u2019\u201dFOR A LONG TIME, her father\u2019s womanizing made Weems wary of commitment. \u201cI thought, \u2018Well, I really don\u2019t want to have any serious relationships with men.\u2019 I see what my father is doing, and I love him. So I was really pissed off at him for a while. It\u2019s like, \u2018Daddy, you really need to understand the impact you\u2019ve had on my life. It ain\u2019t all been good.\u2019 At a certain point, I had so deconstructed my father that he almost became ash. That was pretty scary. So, I came to understand one day that I had to accept that he was a man and not a god.\u201d She was in her 40s when she decided to throw a sleepover party for the two of them, flying out to Oregon, taking him to the beach, shopping for matching pajamas, gambling, talking the entire time. \u201cWe just worked through some things. You can\u2019t do this on the phone for five minutes. It\u2019s touch-base time, Dad.\u201d She ended up taking him to a recording studio to do an interview, in which he talked about his childhood in the South and his love for her mother. \u201cIt was just one of the great conversations of my life,\u201d she says. At his funeral in 2003, Weems played excerpts from the interview.Burying her father also gave way to a new appreciation for her mother, \u201cthis dynamic, powerful woman.\u201d These days, #MeToo has her thinking once again about gender and power, about color and power and the ways, subtle and not, in which private relationships can reflect larger structural imbalances. She touches on the bravery of her friend, the author Tanya Selvaratnam, who recently went public with claims that her ex-partner, the former New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman, had abused her. She recounts her own experiences on the board of a major arts organization in which her suggestions were sidelined, even after other women in the room supported them, only to be put forward after a man voiced support. No one is immune to this kind of unconscious bias: Recently, a female assistant confronted Weems with the fact that a male assistant was being paid more. \u201cReally, Carrie?\u201d she says, recounting her disgust with herself.Part of that involves mobilizing others. This year, out of the blue, Weems received a phone call from Jessica, the young girl \u2014 now a woman \u2014 who once modeled for Weems in \u201cMay Flowers.\u201d Jessica now has a daughter of her own, and a partner, a woman who also has a child. They\u2019re struggling to make a go of it. \u201cI just decided, \u2018You\u2019re going to be the subject of a whole project. It\u2019s just going to be you,\u2019\u201d says Weems. \u201cWhat happens to a black woman who is her age, who drops out of school but has ambition. Who is trying to do the right thing, who is raising children, who\u2019s decided that she\u2019s also gay.\u201d For the project, Jessica will also be self-documenting, telling her own story. Weems gestures as though she\u2019s presenting a gift, passing it on matter-of-factly. \u201cI said, \u2018Here\u2019s a camera.\u2019\u201dHair by Nikki Nelms. Makeup by Yumi Lee at Streeters.

{"Headline": null, "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byTravel TipsWhile there may not be a playbook for handling pint-size petulance at 32,000 feet, pediatric behavioral experts offer insights into how to avoid, or at least contain, that next temper tantrum. Her advice? For children 2 and older, preface the trip with a chat about the (potentially overwhelming) sensory experiences related to airplane travel so they know what to expect. \u201cChildren like predictability,\u201d explains Dr. Nickels. \u201cLet them know that they must sit for a long time, hear strange noises, feel bumps, wear a seatbelt and sit close to strangers.\u201d According to Dr. Nickels, this narrative will reduce anxiety and help the parents refer back to that conversation (\u201cRemember we talked about how you wear the seatbelt until the pilot tells you it\u2019s safe?\u201d) when the child get antsy during the trip. A fact of parenthood: Children are easily bored. One recommended strategy is to keep your children busy so they do not react to the confines of the environment. Parents should be armed with books, developmentally appropriate games (coloring books, Legos, dolls) and electronics. But you can\u2019t just plop these items down on the tray and dive into Netflix. Why? \u201cParents\u2019 tuning out leads to kids\u2019 acting out,\u201d cautions Dr. Nickels. \u201cYou need to hold your child\u2019s attention. Switch up their playtime-reading, stickers, drawing and make snack time an activity, not a detail.\u201d Another potential land mine: hunger. Since a hungry child is a volatile child, it\u2019s essential to have easy-to-transport food (grapes, cheese sticks, goldfish crackers, bars) on hand to keep blood sugar at optimal levels.About those electronics. It\u2019s tempting to let an iPad or other tablet serve as makeshift babysitter. But, nonstop electronics can backfire. Dr. Young posits that gorging on electronics can induce peevishness and tantrums. Dr. Nickels concurs: \u201cChildren do not transition rapidly from digital absorption to reality.\u201d Without parent enforced breaks, kids fall into a daze ignoring hunger, thirst, the need to use the bathroom and exhaustion. Then, when the device is switched off, they go into \u201ddistress mode,\u201d a professional term for a freak out. To avoid overstimulation, set usage limits (\u201cYou can watch two cartoons and then have a snack and read for a while\u201d) before handing over the tablet.Rewards can encourage good behavior. Dr. Nickels is a fan of the goody bag. She advises filling a small sack with four surprises to be distributed at specific points during the flight. Let your children know about the goody bag but not what is inside. This way, they can focus on a goal. Electronics can also be leveraged as a reward for good behavior. Screen time can be earned by spending \u201cX\u201d amount of time doing other activities.Of course, these strategies are not foolproof. So, what can you do if you are that parent with a child in full blown tantrum mode? You can\u2019t blame fellow passengers for becoming irritated, especially if the parents are ignoring the situation. According to Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, passengers will have more empathy if they see that you are trying to diffuse the meltdown. So, standing up and delivering a statement like \u201cI\u2019m sorry my child is being disruptive, please bear with me\u201d can help. But sometimes things can get hostile. On a Jet Blue flight from Miami to Boston, a nearby passenger berated Becca Schoen when her 15-month-old daughter Leah became fussy and started crying. Recalls Ms. Schoen: \u201cMy daughter had missed her nap and was overtired. I was trying to calm her down \u2014 walking the aisle, rocking her \u2014 and after I sat down, just as Leah was settling down, a woman whipped around from the row in front and said \u2018This is outrageous! You need to start walking her again!\u2019 I was mortified. I went to the back of the plane with the baby and began crying myself.\u201d In an aggressive situation like this, Ms. Nelson suggests reaching out to a flight attendant for support. \u201cFlight attendants are trained to de-escalate conflict,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can move a family, offer complimentary food or drink to the frustrated passenger or try to reason with the child themselves.\u201d Even if your child hasn\u2019t uttered a peep, some parents head conflict off at the pass by proffering gift bags to their fellow passengers with a cute note apologizing for unruliness in advance. George Clooney and his wife Amal famously handed out wireless noise canceling headphones to the entire first class cabin on a flight with their infant twins in 2017. But, a less glitzy offering does the job just as well. Cambi Clarke prepared gift bags for passengers in the row ahead, the row behind and aisle seats abutting theirs, all containing an apology note along with chocolate, ear plugs and snacks. \u201cI did not want to be that mom that everyone hates,\u201d says Ms. Clarke. \u201cIt was a preventive measure that made me feel less anxious.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Maybe.But why is it so hard for her to see him now in her mind\u2019s eye? Portrayed in a flux of waxing and waning certainty by Ms. Anyanwu, Nkechi keeps reframing scenes from her relationship with the charismatic MJ (Ian Quinlan), sometimes through a cold lens of regret, sometimes through the magnifying glass of myth.And as the images shift and change, she thinks: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m remembering something or someone else. Maybe I\u2019m mixing him up with another love or person or feeling or time.\u201d Nkechi (who is usually called N) concludes hopefully, \u201cBut maybe he did exist.\u201dThe very youthful profundity of such thoughts saturates this lyrical production, directed as a flickering string of moments by Awoye Timpo. \u201cGood Grief\u201d is shaped by the existential self-consciousness that grips adolescents dealing with the cold fact of mortality.It dares to be as fanciful, histrionic, awkward and downright terrified as young people are in that period when the hormones kick in and emotions seesaw between extremes. It\u2019s a time when your own incandescent vitality makes death seem both impossible and irresistible.Death, accordingly, comes up often in the playful but absolutely serious conversations of N, the daughter of Nigerian-Americans in suburban Pennsylvania, and her classmate MJ. What does it feel like to die? What happens after? And not just to the dead people, but to those who are left behind.Such talk is delivered in fragments in \u201cGood Grief,\u201d which takes place between 1992 and 2005, or rather in an indefinite present in which N restlessly recalls that period. The script jumps almost haphazardly among those years, from the day N meets MJ in elementary school to the shadowed months of her life that stretch into seeming endlessness after he is killed in a car crash.What was once a teasing abstraction has become an implacable reality. And N finds herself forever reliving, and rewriting, those days when she and MJ \u2014 her best friend and almost lover \u2014 would talk and talk and talk about who they were, and how they might be remembered.\u201cGood Grief\u201d could benefit from a more poetic set than the tiered black box provided by Jason Ardizzone-West, with often cold lighting by Oona Curley. I appreciate that everything is occurring in N\u2019s stark midnight of the imagination. But the look doesn\u2019t always match Ms. Anyanwu\u2019s language, which reaches for the stars within the darkness.The script could use more consistency and cadence in its fantasy sequences to achieve the fugue-like effect I presume Ms. Anyanwu is aspiring to. Presenting the scene in which N learns about MJ\u2019s death as a television wrestling match makes sense. But in tone, it\u2019s a one-off riff that doesn\u2019t rest comfortably in context.\u201cGood Grief\u201d still registers throughout as an affecting study of the ambivalence of bereavement. And it is acted by a sensitive cast that finds the authentic emotion within even the most stylized scenes.Oberon K.A. Adjepong and Patrice Johnson Chevannes deftly combine brusqueness and gentleness as N\u2019s helpless parents, who apply scraps of the lore and philosophy of their Nigerian culture in dealing with their bereaved and unresponsive daughter. (\u201cDid you just African proverb me?\u201d N asks her mother in exasperation.)Nnamdi Asomugha, as her jovially supportive but also grief-stunned brother, and Hunter Parrish, as a high school hunk with unexpected depths, are also spot on. But it\u2019s the relationship between the assertive N and the dashing, good-bad boy MJ that gives the play its most haunting emotional substance.In a presumably autobiographical role, Ms. Anyanwu makes it clear that N\u2019s strident, take-charge confidence is a shield with plenty of cracks. And Mr. Quinlan\u2019s MJ manages to embody both a young woman\u2019s dream and a young man\u2019s rudderlessness.Even though they have known each other for most of their lives, N and MJ haven\u2019t quite figured out who and what they are going to be to each other. They do know they feel less lonely \u2014 and better understood \u2014 when they\u2019re together than when they\u2019re with anyone else. This makes the possibility of a sexual connection seem both natural and perhaps ruinous.Advertisement"}

Take Ms. Lo\u2019s recipe for pan-roasted cauliflower, which relies on a store-bought spice mix \u2014 tangy with dried mango and black salt \u2014 to effortlessly turn the vegetable into a quick, South Asian-style chaat.The cauliflower is broken into florets and browned in a saucepan (an impossible task when cooking a large amount), then seasoned with a sauce of cilantro, yogurt and green chiles. To make the garnish, Ms. Lo warms chopped almonds in the toaster oven, which she considers a valuable and versatile tool in any small, efficient kitchen.In her book, Ms. Jones wrote that \u201cthe secret of making cooking for one fun and creative is not to think of a meal as self-contained, but to understand that home cooking is an ongoing process, one dish leading to another.\u201d This is distinct from leftovers, warmed up as they are.To preserve vegetables when cooking in small amounts, Ms. Lo cuts them with care. \u201cIf you\u2019re cutting an onion, you cut it from the growth side, not the root side,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you leave the brown paper skin on so it holds the moisture. Then you cut off what you\u2019re going to use and only peel and chop that part.\u201dFrom shopping to prepping to eating, cooking for one requires more efficiency to avoid waste or a mountain of leftovers.\u201cI think a lot of learning to cook for yourself is about portions, and just making sure you\u2019re cooking the amount you\u2019re going to eat,\u201d Ms. Lo added.\u201cPeople want more recipes for one,\u201d said Mr. Kim, who usually pours himself a glass of wine and plays an episode of the Netflix show \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d on his laptop while he cooks. \u201cCooking for myself is part of my ritual,\u201d he said. \u201cIt keeps me sane.\u201dMr. Kim also believes that cooking on a smaller scale happens to yield more delicious food. \u201cI think it\u2019s a volume situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re making a huge batch, it\u2019s hard to make it taste the way you want.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a way to nurture yourself and nourish yourself,\u201d Ms. Miller said.Ms. Miller\u2019s approach is exact. \u201cOne thing I believe strongly in is buying small quantities of food so you don\u2019t end up wasting ingredients,\u201d she said.When she buys something big, like a whole chicken, Ms. Miller might roast it and use the meat for four consecutive recipes, cooking each one differently but still using up every part of the bird.Otherwise, she\u2019ll portion meat or fish individually and pack them in the freezer. \u201cGetting good at using your freezer is key,\u201d Ms. Miller said. (Likewise, Ms. Lo vacuum-seals bacon in packages of two slices so she can grab a single portion from the freezer.) Ms. Miller also uses ice cube trays to freeze sauces, such as chimichurri, and to store any excess herbs in olive oil before they have the chance to spoil in the fridge. Later she\u2019ll pop out the herb cubes one at a time to finish a soup or stew.She first began cooking for herself when she lived in Paris while attending culinary school. She started small, with rice and saut\u00e9ed vegetables from the market, but later, at a restaurant called Mama Shelter, she tasted a shepherd\u2019s pie made with duck and decided to recreate it at home, just for herself, using mashed potatoes and a piece of store-bought, fat-encased duck confit.\u201cMost people are taught from a young age to be kind and generous to other people,\u201d said Ms. Miller. \u201cWhy not turn some of that kindness and generosity toward yourself?\u201dAdvertisement"}

The utility called the nine counties affected by the outage \u201cextreme fire-risk areas.\u201dIn its statement, the utility said it began telling customers about the potential outages late Saturday.But in brief telephone interviews on Sunday night, people working in the emergency room at two hospitals in the affected areas said they were unaware of an impending loss of power. A man who answered the phone at a men\u2019s homeless shelter in Oroville, Calif., said that he, too, did not know about it and that the power was still on.Matt Nauman, a spokesman for Pacific Gas and Electric, said customers were warned this year that the utility might pre-emptively turn off power in a situation like Sunday\u2019s. \u201cPeople have had multiple contacts,\u201d he said, emphasizing that the utility had reached out to all customers that could be affected.Taste, an upscale restaurant and wine bar in Plymouth, Calif., was preparing to serve customers on Sunday evening \u2014 with or without electricity.\u201cWe\u2019re going to put some extra candles out there and anyone who wants to hang out with us, we\u2019re going to hang out here with them,\u201d said Marc Jensen, the general manager and sommelier.

{"Headline": "\u2018Deutschland 83\u2019 Was a Hit Abroad but a Flop at Home. What About \u2018Deutschland 86\u2019?", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBERLIN \u2014 When the spy series \u201cDeutschland 83\u201d had its premiere in 2015, it was portrayed as a breakthrough moment for German television. At that point, the country had yet to produce any prestige shows with an international following, unlike France and Denmark. The series, which followed a young East German soldier corralled into working as an undercover agent on the other side of the Iron Curtain, was the first German show to air on an American network, SundanceTV. In Britain it became the most-watched foreign-language drama ever.In making \u201cDeutschland 86\u201d \u2014 the second season of the show, which began airing on SundanceTV in the United States last week, and has been streaming on Amazon Prime in Germany, Austria and Switzerland since Oct. 19 \u2014 its creators had to confront the awkward reality of the first season\u2019s geographically divergent popularity. \u201cI would be honest and say it was quite painful,\u201d Ms. Winger said in a recent interview in Berlin alongside her husband. \u201cEvery interview I gave for two years began with, \u2018How does it feel to have made the most publicized flop in the history of German TV?\u2019 \u201dAlthough Ms. Winger says the first season\u2019s reception had little impact on their creative decision-making, \u201cDeutschland 86\u201d introduces an international setting and a more diverse cast. Its first episode finds East German foreign intelligence operative Lenora Rauch (Maria Schrader) working in South Africa with Rose Seithathi (Florence Kasumba) of the African National Congress. The spy been tasked with carrying out an illegal arms deal to help fill the coffers of the dwindling East German treasury. When the plan hits a snag, Lenora asks her nephew, Martin Rauch (Jonas Nay), for help, setting in motion a series of intrigues that take him across the continent.Ms. Winger said they had always planned to use a second season to explore the ways East Germany saw the world outside of its borders. \u201cYou don\u2019t often hear about how the East Germans felt their role was in global politics,\u201d Ms. Winger said. The Wingers also wanted to examine lesser-known elements of the Cold War, settling on the attempts by communist and Western powers to influence politics in Africa. \u201cThe Cold War is now romanticized as this simple, black-and-white world, but if you look a bit closer, you find it was much more complicated,\u201d Mr. Winger said.Germany\u2019s lack of enthusiasm for the first season, Mr. Winger said, was surprising partly because of the country\u2019s seemingly enormous appetite for television about its own tumultuous 20th-century history. But he pointed out that most German television takes an earnest, deferential approach to the subject matter, and some viewers might have been put off by the more freewheeling and humorous take on the Cold War in \u201cDeutschland 83.\u201d\u201cIn Germany, there is a certain look that is called \u2018authentic,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Winger said. \u201cI think there is a certain audience in Germany that doesn\u2019t want its historical drama to be stylized.\u201dHe said he also received numerous complaints about minor historical errors, like, for example, an inaccurately worn West German army uniform. \u201cEvery TV series builds its version of the past,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not going for historical detail, we were going for psychological realism.\u201dMr. Winger noted that RTL, a TV station known in Germany for its reality programming and police procedurals, was always an awkward fit for a prestige spy drama. He said the network was willing to broadcast a second season, but only if the Wingers tweaked it to be closer to its other, more popular series. \u201cYou should have seen the notes,\u201d Ms. Winger said. Ultimately, the show\u2019s production company, UFA Fiction, financed a second season with Amazon Prime as the German distributor, allowing the Wingers to maintain their original vision for the show.\u201cI don\u2019t think we made the show more for an international audience,\u201d Ms. Winger said. \u201cIt\u2019s such intense work, that when you\u2019re making it, you\u2019re making something that first and foremost you like.\u201dIn the years since \u201cDeutschland 83\u201d premiered, a number of other German series have been exported overseas. \u201cBabylon Berlin,\u201d an expensive coproduction between the German public broadcaster ARD and the private Sky channel, was sold in 60 countries. Last year, Netflix premiered its first German-language show, \u201cDark,\u201d and recently announced that it was producing five new German-language shows in addition to an already planned crime show, \u201cDogs of Berlin.\u201dMs. Winger recalled attending a recent TV showcase for Amazon Prime in London, where she was struck by the geographical diversity of the series being presented. Like Netflix, Amazon Prime has moved into producing more original foreign-language series, including \u201cBeat,\u201d a coming crime series set in Berlin.\u201cNow it\u2019s less that there\u2019s American shows and then a couple of things from other places, or that there are German shows and there are American shows, it\u2019s that there are good shows and bad shows,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always felt that way, but now I feel like everyone feels it.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Private Life,\u2019 a Piquant Look at a Couple\u2019s Campaign to Conceive", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byRachel is a writer whose new novel is about to be published. Her husband, Richard, used to run an experimental theater and now, without undue sourness, runs an artisanal pickle company. The couple live in a cluttered, cozy apartment on an East Village block not yet overrun by money. They are literate, witty people (played by Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti) who might rather be smart than nice but are generally pretty nice anyway, even to each other. Their mutual prickliness is a sign of long intimacy, as if they were two cut-to-match pieces of sandpaper. Over the years of their relationship \u2014 he\u2019s 47, she\u2019s about a half-decade younger \u2014 neither one has been too badly scraped up or smoothed out by the other.It\u2019s a happy marriage, in other words, though one that is touched with midlife melancholy. Contentment and disappointment sit so close together on the spectrum of shared experience that it can be hard to tell one from the other. The one thing that\u2019s missing from Rachel and Richard\u2019s lives \u2014 the pursuit of which gives \u201cPrivate Life,\u201d Tamara Jenkins\u2019s piquant and perfect new comedy, its shape and momentum \u2014 is a baby.A heartbreaking adoption near miss lies in the recent past, and they are in the midst of a long, fertility-treatment roller-coaster ride when we first meet them. Literally in the midst: The opening scene is of Richard administering an injection to Rachel\u2019s backside. But while \u201cPrivate Life\u201d has funny and heartfelt insights (as well as some potentially useful information) on modern technologically assisted reproduction and its discontents, the movie is not only or even primarily about fruitless efforts to multiply. Someone once said that life is what happens while you\u2019re making other plans. This movie is about the plans that happen while you\u2019re trying to make another life.Rachel and Richard are not the only household in the picture. Richard has a brother named Charlie (John Carroll Lynch), a prosperous periodontist who lives in the suburbs with his wife, Cynthia (Molly Shannon), and their teenage daughter, Charlotte (Emily Robinson). Charlotte has a half sister, Sadie (Kayli Carter) \u2014 biologically unrelated to Richard or Rachel \u2014 who is adrift and unhappy at 25, trying to finish college and figure out how to live for her art.But if everyone is a little bit ridiculous, nobody is set up to be mocked. The comedy, like the pathos, comes from recognition, and not in a narrowly sociological sense. These are just people, after all.Ms. Carter, a less familiar presence, in some ways tackles the biggest challenge. Sadie is, at least potentially, a foil, a rival, the object of generational resentment and a symbol of hope (or despair) for the future. That\u2019s a lot of baggage for a young person to handle, and Sadie does so partly by ignoring it altogether. She doesn\u2019t regard herself as a supporting character in her aunt and uncle\u2019s narrative. She\u2019s the protagonist of her own movie, as Cynthia and Charlie are of theirs. An equally interesting movie \u2014 about empty nesting rather than incubation \u2014 could have focused on their marriage.Not that I would want anything different about \u201cPrivate Life,\u201d even as I often found myself wishing that everyone in it would take it easier on themselves and one another. Though if they did, it wouldn\u2019t really be life, and it wouldn\u2019t be art either. The joy of this film is how completely it\u2019s both.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Review: \u2018Titans\u2019 Keeps Things Dark in the DC Universe", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe show is based on the longstanding comic-book team most commonly known as the Teen Titans, whose changing lineup over the years has included superhero sidekicks like Robin, Superboy and Aqualad. Here the membership is mostly adult and tending toward creaky and angst-ridden.Dick Grayson a.k.a. Robin (Brenton Thwaites) has split with Batman, afraid that his mentor\u2019s brutality was rubbing off, but in his new job as a Detroit police detective he still gets a charge out of dragging thugs\u2019 faces through broken glass. The crime-fighting couple of Dove (Minka Kelly) and Hawk (Alan Ritchson) aren\u2019t aging well \u2014 he needs a new hip and a Viagra prescription, while she can\u2019t stop thinking about her old boyfriend, who happens to be Robin.The unnamed amnesiac (Anna Diop) asks everyone if they know who she is, and those whose responses she doesn\u2019t like risk being reduced to piles of ash. (At some point she\u2019ll realize that she\u2019s Starfire.) The one teenage member of the nascent team, Rachel (Teagen Croft), who will come to be known as Raven, may have it worst of all: Her supernatural abilities, manifesting in a metaphorically volcanic split personality, have made her the target of a murderous religious cult.That\u2019s a lot to unravel, and the three episodes available for review only begin the process, using Rachel\u2019s plight as a mechanism to start bringing the characters together. A potential sixth member of the team, the shape shifter known in the comics as Beast Boy (Ryan Potter), gets just one brief scene that positions him as possible comic relief down the road.What the opening episodes do make clear is that the high-powered team behind the show \u2014 the Oscar-winning screenwriter Akiva Goldsman, the uber-producer Greg Berlanti and the DC veteran Geoff Johns, a one-time \u201cTeen Titans\u201d writer \u2014 is aiming for the superhero version of kitchen-sink realism rather than comic-book gloss. Like Netflix\u2019s Marvel series and Mr. Berlanti\u2019s DC series for the CW network, \u201cTitans\u201d borrows from police procedurals, action thrillers and teenage dramas, but it goes grayer, quieter and more psychological.It also goes more graphically violent than a typical broadcast or cable superhero show, though it\u2019s far short of the bloodthirstiness displayed in the Marvel-Netflix \u201cPunisher.\u201d The neck-snappings and eye-gougings feel a little more earned because the show is also more serious than usual about making violence a subject rather than a voyeuristic bonus. (It also exhibits some welcome self-awareness, such as when Robin wonders whether Rachel is old enough to be watching \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d)There\u2019s no knowing, though, how well the show will work once the team is assembled and time and story lines and flashbacks need to be parceled out among five or six heroes. (The early episodes favor Robin and Raven.) If you\u2019re partial to the more serious end of the comic-book spectrum, you may already be watching \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d on CW, \u201cJessica Jones\u201d and a few others on Netflix, \u201cLegion\u201d on FX, \u201cThe Runaways\u201d on Hulu and \u201cGotham\u201d on Fox. \u201cTitans\u201d may deserve to join the list, but it\u2019s a big ask.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Facebook Hack Puts Thousands of Other Sites at Risk", "Date": "2018-10-02", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySAN FRANCISCO \u2014 When Mark Zuckerberg introduced an online tool called Facebook Connect in 2008, he hailed it as a kind of digital passport to the rest of the internet. In just a few clicks, users would be able to log in to other apps and sites with their Facebook passwords.The tool was adopted by thousands of other firms, from mom-and-pop publishing companies to high-profile tech outfits like Airbnb and Uber.But the impact could be significantly bigger since those stolen credentials could have been used to gain access to so many other sites. Companies that allow customers to log in with Facebook Connect are scrambling to figure out whether their own user accounts have been compromised.The hack and its fallout underscore the lengths to which Facebook has cemented itself as the identity of the internet, and what happens when the security systems of one company \u2014 trusted by so many \u2014 fail.\u201cJust the sheer fact that this exists will magnify the scale of any hack,\u201d said Jason Polakis, an assistant professor of computer science at the University of Illinois at Chicago.In Europe, where tough new data privacy regulations went into effect in May, the authorities are preparing an investigation of the Facebook breach. Ireland\u2019s Data Protection Commission, which is responsible for overseeing Facebook in the region, said it was gathering information and establishing the scope of its inquiry.Tinder, the dating app, has found no evidence that accounts have been breached, based on the \u201climited information Facebook has provided,\u201d Justine Sacco, a spokeswoman for Tinder and its parent company, the Match Group, said in a statement. Tinder, as well as other Match Group apps, rely on Facebook Connect as a method of logging in.Ms. Sacco added that Facebook could do more to help by providing a specific list of users hit by the attack.Over the past decade, Facebook has sold outside companies on Facebook Connect with a simple proposition: Connect to our platform, and we\u2019ll make it faster and easier for people to use your apps.The Connect tool was about achieving ubiquity. Users would be more apt to sign up for new apps and sites if doing so was easier, Facebook argued. It also brought an added measure of security, since users wouldn\u2019t need to create and remember new passwords every time they signed up for a new app.But in July 2017, that measure of security fell short. By exploiting three software bugs, attackers forged \u201caccess tokens,\u201d digital keys used to gain entry to a user\u2019s account. From there, the hackers were able to do anything users could do on their own Facebook accounts, including logging in to third-party apps.But there are still questions about an additional 40 million Facebook accounts that may have been affected. Facebook forced those 40 million users to log out and reauthenticate their credentials. It was unclear whether these accounts used Facebook to connect to outside apps.Citing \u201can abundance of caution,\u201d Facebook said it was building a tool to help outside developers identify users who were affected in the hack by pinpointing potentially compromised accounts on their services.In a conference call with reporters on Friday, Facebook said it had not assessed the scope of the breach, nor did the company discover who was responsible for the attack.Hackers often target large databases of credentials, which can provide access to other accounts if users created the same password for multiple sites or have logged in to third-party accounts with their Facebook account.Since Friday, Facebook has held calls with developers at other companies to explain steps they can take to assess the damage at their own organizations.The security team at Uber, the ride-hailing giant, is logging some users out of their accounts to be cautious, said Melanie Ensign, a spokeswoman for Uber. It is asking them to log back in \u2014 a preventive measure that would invalidate older, stolen access tokens.Uber has reviewed its login data from the past year and hasn\u2019t found any indications that Facebook credentials were used improperly.\u201cBut we still have to go through the investigation,\u201d Ms. Ensign said. \u201cFor those that are most at risk, we have logged them out, so they\u2019ll have to log back in to the account.\u201dFacebook faces fallout from regulators both at home and abroad. On Friday, Senators Mark Warner of Virginia and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, both Democrats, used the occasion to renew their calls for legislation reining in large tech companies.The European Union\u2019s probe will be an early test of its new data-protection law, the General Data Protection Regulation. The law allows Facebook to be fined up to 4 percent of its global revenue, though many consider such an outcome unlikely.\u201cG.D.P.R. was designed to address the big tech giants, who are enormous, have huge resources and do very complicated things with personal data,\u201d said James Castro-Edwards, the head of the data-protection practice at the London law firm Wedlake Bell. \u201cThis is the sort of battle that G.D.P.R. was drafted to be used in.\u201dAs Facebook\u2019s power has grown, some outside companies have become wary of relying on it too much.While Tinder originally relied exclusively on the Facebook login for several years, the dating company last year introduced a way for people to create new accounts without using Facebook. Since then, fewer than 25 percent of new users sign up for Tinder using Facebook Connect.Similarly, Netflix stopped allowing users to connect using their Facebook accounts three years ago, and new customers must create user names and passwords when they sign up.But for the thousands of other companies that rely on Facebook to serve customers, it is unclear whether or not they will know the extent of the damage.\u201cSo many websites support Facebook login, and it was vulnerable for so long that it\u2019s hard to give an idea of the scope of this attack,\u201d Mr. Polakis said.Adam Satariano contributed reporting from London.Advertisement"}

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.Happy Halloween!We\u2019re six days away from Election Day, and the Florida ballot might just be the stuff of nightmares. First come the tight races for Senate, House and governor. Then, a slew of local races \u2014 everything from Statehouse to school board.And then, finally, comes the parade of ballot measures \u2014 13 in total.Among other issues, Florida voters will decide on whether to permit casinos, ban vaping in indoor workplaces, restore felon voting rights, end a certain kind of betting on greyhound dog racing, increase the judicial retirement age to 75, mandate death benefits for emergency medical workers and increase the amount of home value exempted from property tax.Whew.Floridians are hardly alone. When voters across the country head to the polls, they will be deciding not just on candidates but on a long list of complex policy issues \u2014 the majority added to the ballot through efforts by voters and advocacy groups.Over the past two years, there\u2019s been an explosion in the number of citizen-crafted initiatives that end up on the ballot, as voters frustrated with deadlocked government take legislating into their own hands.Some of the measures, like an effort in North Carolina to create a constitutional right to hunt and fish, seem designed by political parties to drive their voters to the polls. Others, like the push to legalize marijuana, are the result of persistent political movements.In total, 69 of the 155 statewide measures on the ballot this year are citizen-initiated, according to Ballotpedia. That\u2019s a slight dip from two years ago, when 71 citizen initiatives were on the ballot.But it\u2019s a significant increase from the past few decades, says Mr. Altic. From 1980 through 2014, an average of 54 citizen initiatives appeared on the ballot.The biggest topic this year is election policy. Twenty measures in 15 states would reshape redistricting, voting requirements, ballot access, campaign finance and ethics. Taxes, marijuana, Medicaid expansion and Marsy\u2019s Law, which expands the rights of crime victims, are also popular proposals.The campaigns around the initiatives can cost serious cash. A single California proposition that would limit profits for dialysis companies has attracted nearly $110 million in spending.They can also reverberate down the ticket. California Republicans have been fairly blatant in their strategy to use a gas tax repeal measure to drive conservatives to the polls. And in North Carolina, Republicans hope the hunting and fishing mandate, along with a proposal requiring an ID to vote, will juice turnout.Governors and state legislatures are pushing back, using a variety of tactics to overturn, diminish or declare unconstitutional initiatives put on the ballot by the same voters who elected them. This year, 10 citizen-initiated measures were taken off the ballot before November.____________________Here\u2019s some of what we found:\u2022 The percentage of candidates who are white men is the lowest it\u2019s been in the last four elections.\u2022 More than a quarter of all the candidates running this year are female, including 84 women of color \u2014 a 42 percent increase from just two years ago. There are at least 215 candidates of color, and a record 26 openly L.G.B.T. candidates \u2014 more than five times the number in 2010.\u2022 Among Democratic candidates, white men are actually a minority, making up just 41 percent of candidates for Congress and governor this year.\u2022 Despite all the diversity, white men will remain a majority. Women and candidates of color will most likely make up close to a third of Congress and governor\u2019s mansions next year, which is about the same as now. Winning all of the races that are considered competitive would increase their share to nearly 40 percent.____________________You can see all our polling here.____________________________________________________________Note: In yesterday\u2019s newsletter, we left the credit off our lead artwork.

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I\u2019m Lisa Lerer, your host.Senator Lisa Murkowski didn\u2019t say much. She mostly listened, as the group of women gathered in her office shared their stories of sexual violence.When Ms. Murkowski spoke, said Hilary Morgan, a consultant from Anchorage, it was to tell the women how her \u201cheart had been breaking\u201d for the last two weeks.\u201cShe said she\u2019s probably six inches shorter because of the weight of everything,\u201d said Ms. Morgan, who was part of that group of women, 130 in all, who had flown 15 hours from Alaska to Washington with less than a day\u2019s notice to meet with their senator.This morning, Ms. Murkowski voted no on advancing the confirmation of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. She was the lone Republican to oppose him.It\u2019s easy to forget how hard it is to be an independent in Washington.

She opposed a Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act because of threatened Medicaid cuts, and was against the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as education secretary because of risks to rural school budgets.Yes, those votes are outliers: She has also voted for a number of the administration\u2019s priorities, including the tax bill. But they\u2019re more opposition than nearly any other Republican senator, including Mr. Flake and Mr. Sasse, has shown during the Trump administration.Ms. Murkowski doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time worrying about being out of step with her party, says Andrew Halcro, an old friend who served with her in the Alaska Legislature.\u201cIf history is any indicator, she\u2019ll just shrug it off and continue to do her job,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve seen Lisa Murkowski take a tough vote for the last 20 years, her decisions have always come down to people, not politics.\u201dIf Ms. Murkowski is unique, perhaps it\u2019s because her home state\u2019s politics are unlike any other\u2019s.Her father, former Senator Frank Murkowski, appointed her to the Senate in 2002 when he became the state\u2019s governor. (She was picked over an up-and-coming mayor from Wasilla, Sarah Palin.)Eight years later, Ms. Palin backed another Republican, Joe Miller, who defeated Ms. Murkowski in the primary. Against the wishes of party leaders, Ms. Murkowski launched a write-in campaign. She won the election, largely thanks to the backing of women and Alaska Natives \u2014 an unusual coalition for a Republican.\u201cThere will be long-term resentment among Republican voters due to Senator Murkowski\u2019s lack of courage today,\u201d said Penny Nance, president of the conservative group Concerned Women for America. \u201cConservative women never forget.\u201dTheir remarks line up with those of national Republicans, who, polls show, strongly back Judge Kavanaugh. But, as always, politics in Alaska are a different story.Issues of sexual violence clearly weighed on Ms. Murkowski during her vote today. Judge Kavanaugh, she said in remarks to reporters outside the Senate chamber, is \u201ca good man.\u201dBut, she added, \u201cif people who are victims, people who feel that there is no fairness in our system of government, particularly in our courts, then you\u2019ve gone down a path that is not good and right.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with issues right now that are bigger than the nominee.\u201d____________________A remark by the Democratic Senate candidate in Tennessee, Phil Bredesen, caught our eye today, as we track how the campaigns are responding to the Kavanaugh confirmation.His stance cost him the backing of a top Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA Action. (They had not yet put any money into his race.)It\u2019s a political play that makes a lot of sense: Mr. Bredesen is running a tight race in a red state. He needs to win independents and disaffected Republicans. For a Democrat in Tennessee, publicly losing national Democratic support might be better than having it.____________________I spent the morning on Capitol Hill, observing all the chaos around today\u2019s historic vote.People packed themselves into the offices of senators (including Joe Manchin\u2019s, above).Everywhere Ms. Murkowski went, she was trailed by reporters.And outside the Capitol, the streets were flooded with protesters, many of whom were arrested.____________________There are so many! But here are five that come to mind, in reverse chronological order:_____________________________________________________________Thanks for reading. Politics is more than what goes on inside the White House. On Politics brings you the people, issues and ideas reshaping our world.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Need a Song for Your Commercial? Try These Campers", "Date": "2018-10-14", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAdvertisingWhen Bose was trying to find the right song for a commercial promoting its latest wireless headphones in partnership with the National Football League last fall, it didn\u2019t dig through catalogs of blockbuster hits from big-name rock stars or hip-hop artists. Instead, it chose a newly written song \u2014 \u201cGet Loud for Me\u201d \u2014 by a little-known singer named Gizzle.\u201cWe had a good idea that it would probably do well in the sports space, but everything else was a pleasant surprise,\u201d said Gizzle, who wrote the song with Mike Sabath.And it was all thanks to a so-called sync camp.Gizzle, whose real name is Glenda Proby, had written songs for artists like Puff Daddy, Kanye West and Nicki Minaj, but she wasn\u2019t known as a singer. At least, not until she penned the song at one of the camps, multiday gatherings put on twice a year by Sony/ATV Music. There, clients of the music publishing company gather to write songs for use in commercials, movie trailers, TV shows and video games.Gizzle\u2019s song accounts for one of about 300 signed deals involving music created in the camps, said Brian Monaco, the president and global chief marketing officer of Sony/ATV Music. Sony/ATV will share the publishing rights with the artist of any song that\u2019s written in the camps.The camps, which last three to four days, began in 2012 and have been held in cities like Los Angeles, Nashville and Toronto. Mr. Monaco prefers to hold the camps in a studio away from the main areas of a city so that the artists aren\u2019t distracted. It has to have at least six rooms that can be used for writing and producing, and a rehearsal space. For one Los Angeles camp, he chose Fonogenic Studios, which is in Van Nuys, Calif., and partly owned by a member of the Foo Fighters.\u201cI like it because it\u2019s a little off the beaten track, so people won\u2019t leave in the middle of a session to go to Starbucks, because there\u2019s nowhere to go,\u201d Mr. Monaco said. He also held a Los Angeles camp at Village Studios, where Bob Dylan, Lady Gaga and others have recorded.Sony/ATV invites 15 to 20 clients to each camp. On the night of their arrival, Mr. Monaco hosts a dinner so everyone can meet. The next morning, he divides them into groups of three to write songs. He will often make them aware of a brand that is looking for a particular type of song for a commercial or a film. Representatives of the brands sometimes attend as well.Each day, the attendees switch groups.There can sometimes be creative differences.\u201cThere have definitely been some disagreements, but never deal breakers, never any punches thrown,\u201d said Kevin Bard, a singer and songwriter who has attended all the camps. \u201cPeople disagree on music, but that\u2019s kind of what makes it great.\u201dMr. Monaco recalled one artist who persuaded his group that the song they were working on needed some salty language, forgetting that the music was aimed at a family-friendly commercial audience.\u201cI said: \u2018Why would you be cursing? There\u2019s no brand that\u2019s going to use this,\u2019\u201d Mr. Monaco said.After that, Sony started having one of its representatives sit in on the sessions. The representatives generally offer guidance if the writing is heading down the wrong path, but they try not to critique otherwise.\u201cIf you start making demands on people\u2019s creativity, I think it would ruin the process,\u201d Mr. Monaco said.The groups work from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., although some will keep working until late at night if they\u2019re trying to finish or improve a song. On the final day, everyone gets together to listen to all the songs created \u2014 usually 20 to 30.While Sony/ATV\u2019s camps are unique, other music companies, like Warner/Chappell, have teams of ad music experts that help brands connect with artists and custom-made music. Ron Broitman, executive vice president and head of synchronization at Warner/Chappell, said he had seen a surge in demand for top songwriters, producers and artists to create music for brands.\u201cMusic can make or break a campaign,\u201d said Denise Kohnke, founder of House United, a strategic marketing company.\u201cIt was quite a surreal feeling to see something you created on TV and to see the reaction it had with people, where they were tracking it down and leaving YouTube comments,\u201d he said of his work at the camps. \u201cIt opened all of our eyes to the power that TV and film holds.\u201dOne of the camp\u2019s big success stories is MoZella, whose real name is Maureen Anne McDonald. She wrote multiple songs for commercials before moving on to collaborations with major artists, including helping to write \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d for Miley Cyrus and \u201cLove So Soft\u201d for Kelly Clarkson.\u201cAfter that, touring picked up, and the awareness of what I\u2019m doing definitely increased,\u201d Mr. Scibilia said. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy. Pretty astronomical difference.\u201dOnline, people would write, \u201cLove this song and found you through a Jeep commercial,\u201d he said. He has since had about 25 songs synced to commercials, TV shows and movie trailers.Mr. Scibilia said the camps had given him a chance to make a living writing songs and lifted his profile as a performer.\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a portal for people to enter into your world,\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Slumping Stock Market Enters Negative Territory for the Year ", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAnother wave of selling hit the nearly decade-long bull market as investors worried that the ideal climate they have long enjoyed \u2014 a surging economy, low interest rates and fast-growing corporate profits \u2014 would soon be behind them. The benchmark Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index shed 3 percent on Wednesday, wiping out its gains for the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was down 4.4 percent, and has fallen more than 12 percent since early September.Just over a month ago, the S.&P. 500 was up nearly 10 percent for 2018, with expectations that coming quarterly corporate earnings reports \u2014 juiced by a generous tax cut and strong economic growth \u2014 would keep sending stock prices upward. It hasn\u2019t worked out that way. Instead of celebrating quarterly profit and sales numbers that have largely lived up to expectations, investors have zeroed in on potential risks to the economic and corporate profit outlook for the coming year. Rising commodity costs tied to tariffs on imports, expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep raising interest rates, and an economic slowdown in China could all start to bite. And that\u2019s on top of investors\u2019 anxiety about what the midterm elections could mean for their portfolios.\u201cIt was kind of a market that was looking for a reason to have some money come out of it,\u201d said Tony Dwyer, chief market strategist with the brokerage firm Canaccord Genuity in New York. \u201cAnd it found it.\u201dThe Dow Jones industrial average fell 608 points, or 2.4 percent, on Wednesday. And the Nasdaq has now fallen into correction territory \u2014 a decline of more than 10 percent from an earlier peak, which indicates a drop that\u2019s more serious than a garden-variety slump. The S.&P. 500 is down to 2,656.10, more than 9 percent off its recent peak on Sept. 20, meaning it, too, is nearing a correction. Some market observers think that investors may be moving to the sidelines before what could be a very close and bitter election. \u201cI think people just want to clear the decks and get the heck out before the midterm elections, frankly,\u201d said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. President Trump has repeatedly cited the strong performance of the stock market as evidence of the success of his administration\u2019s business-friendly approach. And as the market has slid lately, he has ratcheted up his criticism of the Federal Reserve\u2019s plan to raise interest rates as economic growth remains strong. Low interest rates have helped support economic growth and the stock market since the financial crisis 10 years ago. But with unemployment at a 49-year low, the Fed is now raising interest rates, saying it wants to keep the economy from overheating, which could set off inflation. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates again at its next meeting in December.The rise in interest rates has been particularly painful for some pockets of the markets. Shares of homebuilders are down more than 16 percent this month, as rising mortgage rates have made houses less affordable. Smaller companies \u2014 which are heavily exposed to floating-rate debt \u2014 have also been hurt by rising rates, which increases the cost of their debt payments. The Russell 2000 index of small-capitalization stocks has fallen more than 13 percent in October. And the president\u2019s trade war with China has increasingly preoccupied the markets, analysts said. Official numbers released by Beijing last week showed China\u2019s economic growth has slowed to 6.5 percent, its lowest level since 2009. The slowdown in China, the world\u2019s second-largest economy, could mean falling sales for American companies that export to that market. As large consumers of metal who have invested heavily to gain access to the Chinese auto market \u2014 the world\u2019s largest \u2014 carmakers are particularly vulnerable to such risks. On Wednesday, Ford cited weak sales in China for falling profits. Company officials said issues surrounding trade disputes \u2014 including tariffs on imported steel and aluminum \u2014 could cost Ford $1 billion this year. \u201cWhat is really happening here is that people are saying, \u2018We just don\u2019t know about trade. We don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to hit the margins or the earnings streams next year,\u2019\u201d said Michael Purves, chief global strategist at the brokerage firm Weeden & Company. Mr. Purves said investors were eager for a resolution to the trade dispute and nervous that it could escalate further.\u201cI think there is a game of chicken going on between Trump and the markets right now,\u201d he added. On Wednesday, the market tumble snowballed over the course of the day. Technology companies that have driven big market gains were badly battered. Shares in the tech heavyweights Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook all fell more than 5 percent. Netflix fell more than 9 percent after a media report that Apple planned to announce a subscription television service that would go head-to-head with its streaming service. The news wasn\u2019t all bad for tech. Later Wednesday, Microsoft reported results that exceeded analyst expectations, sending its shares higher in after-hours trading. And Tesla shares also rose in after-hours trading after the electric-car maker reported its first profit in two years. Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "After a Long Wait, India\u2019s #MeToo Movement Suddenly Takes Off", "Date": "2018-10-09", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMUMBAI, India \u2014 After a year of fits and starts, India\u2019s #MeToo movement has leapt forward over the past week, getting concrete action in two of the country\u2019s most powerful industries: entertainment and the news media.Phantom Films, a major Bollywood production house that made \u201cSacred Games\u201d for Netflix, was suddenly dissolved on Saturday, with two of four partners publicly apologizing for mishandling an employee\u2019s complaint that she was sexually assaulted in 2015 by a third partner, Vikas Bahl.The Bollywood actress Tanushree Dutta filed a new complaint with the police, reviving her 10-year-old case against a prominent actor, Nana Patekar, for allegedly ordering changes to a movie dance sequence so he could grope her.\u201cIt almost felt like the women were waiting,\u201d Ms. Kukreja said in an interview. \u201c \u2018Am I allowed to share my trauma? Am I allowed to share my story?\u2019 \u201dBy Monday afternoon, the influential political editor of The Hindustan Times, Prashant Jha, had been stripped of his management role as the company investigated a former reporter\u2019s complaint that he had sexually harassed her. On the same day, seven women sent a letter to The Times of India, the flagship paper of the country\u2019s most powerful media company, accusing a top editor of years of unwanted touching, explicit messages and sexual propositions. The editor, K. R. Sreenivas, was put on leave amid promises of \u201ca speedy and fair inquiry.\u201dOther journalists are under investigation by their employers or have apologized for inappropriate behavior, and #MeToo accusations have begun spreading to other industries, including advertising and politics. At least four women have accused a government minister for external affairs, the former newspaper editor M. J. Akbar, of sexually harassing them when he was a journalist. Mr. Akbar was traveling overseas on Tuesday and has not made any comment about the allegations.The flurry of activity has created a commotion among the educated elite here, but it has had little immediate effect on the vast majority of women in India, a deeply patriarchal and traditional society in which women and girls often have little control over their lives and are frequently abused.Women\u2019s rights advocates said that for India, the events of the past week had been stunning, with the movement in the country gathering momentum.\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a wave has come,\u201d said Vrinda Grover, a New Delhi lawyer and human rights activist who helped draft some of India\u2019s laws on sexual harassment and child abuse. \u201cUntil now, we have seen consequences only on the women who complained. This time, the consequences are for those who have committed the misconduct.\u201dSandhya Menon, a freelance writer who tweeted the first public complaints about Mr. Sreenivas and two other journalists on Friday, said her goal had been to improve men\u2019s behavior and push employers to hold harassers accountable.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this level of action,\u201d Ms. Menon said in an interview. (Mr. Sreenivas declined to comment beyond saying that he was cooperating with the newspaper\u2019s investigation.)\u201cThis behavior has to be shamed,\u201d the former reporter, Sonora Jha, now a professor of communication at Seattle University, said in an interview.Mr. Adhikari, who is retired and lives in the Washington area, said in an email that he did not recall the incidents described. \u201cI would sincerely apologize if I made anyone uncomfortable in my presence, but I deny sexually harassing anyone,\u201d he wrote. Nevertheless, citing the \u201cstain on his reputation,\u201d he resigned as a fellow at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, and said he would stop writing his column for The Times of India.Ms. Kukreja, the comedian, said that it had been cathartic to see so many women speak out now, but that it was also difficult to hear so many stories of men behaving badly. \u201cI had four days straight of panic attacks,\u201d she said, adding that she had found peace by performing a stand-up comedy set for 15 minutes each night.Speaking out has had its risks. The backlash on Twitter has been intense, with some commenters demanding evidence or suggesting that the women had encouraged the come-ons.Some of the women who shared their stories said that they had gone to their bosses or human resources departments, but that no action had been taken. India\u2019s court system is so glacial that a rape case against one prominent editor, Tarun Tejpal, is still pending five years after it was filed.The case of Ms. Dutta, the Bollywood actress, shows just how arduous it can be to pursue a sexual harassment claim.She first made the allegations against Mr. Patekar while they were working on a film in 2008. Ms. Dutta said Mr. Patekar pushed to change a dance routine to make it more physically intimate.She fled the set, and a mob surrounded her car, smashed the windshield and trapped her inside.She filed a police complaint against Mr. Patekar, who denied the allegations. And she spoke openly to the Indian news media, which covered the story extensively for several days. Then everyone moved on.Ms. Dutta, 34, a former Miss India who now lives in the United States, urged caution about characterizing this moment as anything like the conversation that has occurred in Hollywood.Still, India is evolving, she said. \u201cMaybe the evolution is slower compared to the West, but evolution is inevitable. It is happening in the remotest, darkest corners of our planet.\u201dFollow on Vindu Goel on Twitter: @vindugoel.Vindu Goel and Ayesha Venkataraman reported from Mumbai, and Kai Schultz from New Delhi.

When officers arrived, they found Laquan McDonald, a black teenager, near the scene. He refused to stop when they told him to. He had a three-inch pocketknife. The officers followed Laquan down South Pulaski Road and 41st Street. Officer Jason Van Dyke arrived. Dashboard-camera footage shows Officer Van Dyke shooting Laquan 16 times, the teenager\u2019s body spinning as the bullets were pumped into it. Supported byThe midterm elections are nearly upon us, and the breakout story this year has been the record number of women running for office. But equally impressive is the number of minority candidates on ballots across America. One minority woman is Lupe Valdez, the Democratic nominee for governor in Texas. A former Dallas County sheriff, she is also the first openly gay Latina to be nominated by a major political party for the top post in the state. Ms. Valdez is from a family of migrant workers and was raised in one of the poorest ZIP codes in San Antonio. In July, the incumbent, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, had $28.9 million. Ms. Valdez, who on the stump has promoted a message of equality and change, had a mere $222,000. Supported byWhen Daniel Payne, a white junior at the University of Mississippi, saw that a major benefactor of the journalism school he attends had posted racially insensitive comments on social media, he immediately thought \u201cit was going to be really, really bad.\u201dThe post spread quickly on social media, and within hours it looked as though the University of Mississippi, a name almost synonymous with racial strife, would be rocked by yet another controversy. But students, faculty and community members have been surprised by how the episode was handled. Chancellor Jeffrey Vitter immediately condemned the post. The journalism school faculty held an emergency meeting at 7 a.m. the following day, and two public forums were scheduled for that night.Mr. Meek had donated $5.3 million to the journalism school, which was renamed the Meek School of Journalism and New Media in 2009. The school also denounced Mr. Meek\u2019s post. A letter was sent to the entire university community explaining the process of removing Mr. Meek\u2019s name from the building. A subsequent note explained that Mr. Vitter planned to expedite the process.Whether Mr. Meek\u2019s name will be removed from the journalism school remains unclear.

{"Headline": "\u2018Terrace House\u2019 Has Never Been So Heartwarming and Humiliating", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byAmerican reality television has, in recent years, become so ubiquitous and hypertrophied as to be staid. All the moves are telegraphed, all the story lines exhausted. Which is why the Japanese reality show \u201cTerrace House\u201d \u2014 the first iteration of which dates back to 2012 \u2014 feels so refreshing. It moves at a leisurely pace. It asks little of its participants. It soothes rather than rankles.While \u201cTerrace House\u201d has gradually gained international acclaim after stints in Tokyo and Hawaii that aired on Netflix from 2015 to 2017, its current season, called \u201cOpening New Doors,\u201d has solidified the show\u2019s status as an international phenomenon. Set in the smallish city of Karuizawa, it has featured an unlikely love match, the return of one of the show\u2019s memorable figures, several people suffering from romantic butterfingers and a surprising acceptance of acid jazz as viable pop music.Netflix recently released the fourth batch of \u201cOpening New Doors\u201d episodes. So three New York Times superfans \u2014 Jon Caramanica, Andrew R. Chow and Amanda Hess \u2014 engaged in one of the show\u2019s greatest pastimes, commentary on \u201cTerrace House,\u201d charting the highs (the beautiful male tears!), the lows (get out of here, Taka!) and the questions (how does Noah drink so much off camera?) of the engrossing and enchanting \u201cOpening New Doors.\u201dBut I didn\u2019t know any of that when she unexpectedly arrived this season in the middle of a quiet Christmas celebration at the house, carting an obscene bouquet of white roses and enough wine to sedate the entire cast. To me she was a stranger; to the housemates, a legend. I loved this moment. It was like the show flipped into a whole new genre \u2014 romantic suspense? \u2014 ignited by a dramatic history I never knew existed.But then she turns a little bit bad, too, helping to foment one of the unequaled, most embarrassing moments in \u201cTerrace House\u201d history. Seina owed Shohei almost nothing, but she could have revoked her drunken profession of feelings before he, like, rented out a church to ask her to be his girlfriend. Stay in the house for too long, and you end up revealing the less-ideal parts of yourself.At least, I used to hate Mayu. This final batch of episodes somehow managed to turn her into a pitiful figure. \u201cTerrace House\u201d doesn\u2019t really do villains, not for long anyway, and it makes the show much more interesting.But his fate as a villain was sealed when he told Shohei he had drunkenly kissed Seina, maybe one or two days after Shohei had asked Seina to be his girlfriend and mightily struck out. Throughout the conversation, Noah was laughing, some combination of awkward and sinister. Shohei maintained his composure, but Noah only giggled harder \u2014 cold evidence of his empty soul.And once that distractible party animal turned his attention to Seina, Yui launched a dinner table prosecution that reduced the unflappable Seina to stutters. I can\u2019t wait for her interactions with the new member, Shunsuke, a wholly new archetype in the show\u2019s history.That she took weeks to make her move \u2014 on camera, at least \u2014 underscores another one of her unflattering qualities: She\u2019s also the most aware of how she appears through the show\u2019s lens, both in visual and narrative terms. (\u201cTerrace House\u201d airs roughly in real time in Japan, and the participants are allowed to watch the show, as well as interact with the outside world \u2014 the narrative and metanarratives intertwine.) You can see her modulating her reactions in real time, and then performing those modulations very, very deliberately. Initially, it was dramatic, but it\u2019s become dull. She\u2019s got nothing on Kim, Kourtney, Khlo\u00e9 or Kris.So why do people come to \u201cTerrace House,\u201d and then why do they leave? Some come for the nebulous bounty of exposure, but more appear to come because they are at a crossroads. \u201cTerrace House\u201d is a parallel universe in which they can devote themselves to self-problem-solving (unless you are Yuudai, in which case you mostly get lectured, no matter how many times you promise to work hard). And most people leave because of love \u2014 they found it, or they very pointedly didn\u2019t.While they are in the house though, the mood is for sure purgatorial. (The seeming off-the-grid location in Karuizawa, population around 20,000, enhances that energy.) \u201cTerrace House\u201d is clearly a liminal space, but between what and what? It differs. I think the way in which each cast member gives a specific meaning to the \u201cTerrace House\u201d experience is its strongest feature \u2014 for Shion and Tsubasa, it was a place to be jolted by unexpected love; for Shohei, it was a source of creative energy (and a path to Spotify streams); for Yui, it was an opportunity to define herself as an adult, living away from home for the first time; for Ami, it was a reminder that she hates guys who express any interest in her.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix\u2019s Cash-Fueled Road to Streaming Dominance", "Date": "2018-10-17", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe streaming service surprised Wall Street with huge gains in subscribers in the third quarter. The results showed why AT&T and Disney spent big on their latest acquisitions.Here are some notable numbers from Netflix:130 million paying customers as of September$14.9 billion in revenue in the last 12 months$1.3 billion in profit for the same period7.6 million more paid subscribers expected to be added in the last three months of 201823 Emmy Awards this year, the same as HBOHere\u2019s another: $18.6 billion.It\u2019s also far more than what traditional players like the Walt Disney Company, HBO or NBCUniversal generally spend on entertainment.The size of that number explains why Netflix is valued so highly relative to other entertainment businesses. The company\u2019s market capitalization stands at about $156 billion. Disney, by comparison, is valued at about $174 billion.Those figures look out of whack when the sizes of the companies are compared. Netflix had $14.9 billion in revenue and $1.3 billion in profit for the last 12 months. Disney generated $58 billion in revenue and $10.1 billion in profit for the 12 months that ended June 30. (Disney won\u2019t report results for its most recent quarter until Nov. 8.) In other words, Disney made eight times the money that Netflix did, but it\u2019s worth only about 12 percent more. Another way to consider it: Netflix investors are paying about $120 for every $1 of profit it generates. For Disney, investors are paying about $17. Netflix is the streaming pioneer, but it\u2019s about to get some serious competition. Those astronomical deals put Netflix\u2019s $18.6 billion content spend in a slightly different light.\u201cThere are so many competitors,\u201d Reed Hastings, Netflix\u2019s chief executive, said on an earnings call Tuesday. \u201cDisney\u2019s going to enter. AT&T is going to expand HBO. YouTube is on fire. And there\u2019s video gaming like Fortnight. There are so many ways to have great entertainment on the screen.\u201dNetflix\u2019s appetite for content means it has to spend big, resulting in what\u2019s known as \u201cnegative free cash flow.\u201d More money is going out the door than coming in, a difference that Netflix covers by borrowing even more.But Netflix can also show a profit because accounting rules allow entertainment companies to record most of their production or licensing costs later on.A show like \u201cStranger Things,\u201d entirely funded and owned by Netflix, costs as much as $8 million per episode. Netflix pays for all of that upfront, but the cost isn\u2019t counted until the show is available on the service, often a year or more after production. The next season is expected to be released in the summer of 2019. Multiply that by the hundreds of hours of original content that Netflix produces every year, and the cash starts to bleed out. The company had negative free cash flow of $2 billion last year. It expects that figure to rise to about $3 billion this year and about the same next year.For Netflix, it\u2019s all part of the plan. An aggressive content strategy fuels a successful marketing strategy that leads to more subscribers. (There is also mounting debt.)Promoting \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d now in its final season, was \u201creally about selling Netflix,\u201d Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer, said on the call. \u201cIt\u2019s getting people excited about seeing something they can only see on Netflix.\u201dDisney, for example, plans to pull its Marvel films, like \u201cBlack Panther\u201d and \u201cThe Avengers,\u201d from Netflix once those licenses start expiring next year. Viewers will likely have to go to Disney\u2019s new streaming service or Hulu to watch those movies.AT&T is likely to do the same with its blockbuster features, such as \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d or hit series like \u201cFriends\u201d once those syndication rights start expiring.It might explain why Mr. Hastings doesn\u2019t seem too bothered by the competition.\u201cThat\u2019s going to make it exciting for us,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for consumers. Incredible for producers. I mean there\u2019s never been so much TV and movies being created around the world. So the game is on.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "LeBron James Once \u2018Hated\u2019 Southern California. How He Came to Embrace It.", "Date": "2018-10-18", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLOS ANGELES \u2014 The sun had already set when LeBron James and his high school teammates pulled up to the beach in a limousine-length Cadillac Escalade. They had come straight from the airport, with 50 Cent blaring from the speakers.\u201cIt was dark as hell,\u201d Willie McGee, one of the other players from St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio, recalled in a telephone interview. \u201cBut I had never seen the ocean.\u201dIt was January 2003. An 18-year-old senior on the cusp of global celebrity, James arrived with his team on this auspicious trip to Los Angeles for a nationally televised game against Mater Dei High School, a basketball powerhouse from Santa Ana, Calif. But first, the beach. Unlike James, most of his teammates were visiting California for the first time.\u201cThat was one of the best things about that trip,\u201d Romeo Travis, another player on that team, said. \u201cFor us Ohio guys, being out there bumping 50 Cent in a stretch limo was surreal.\u201dAs for the game itself, which was played at Pauley Pavilion, on the U.C.L.A. campus, James actually shot the ball poorly in a narrow win. But his struggles hardly mattered: For one night, on the grandest stage of his embryonic career, in one of the most glamorous cities in the world, he was the biggest star of all.\u201cI remember it not because it was a great game,\u201d said Sonny Vaccaro, a former Nike and Adidas executive who was sitting courtside, \u201cbut because it was historic.\u201dOver the years, he has found the weather to be pleasant. He developed an interest in the city\u2019s art scene. His wife likes it here. He recently put his children in school here. And now he has upended the N.B.A. by joining the Lakers, instantly thrusting them back into the postseason picture while minting himself as a mogul in the making.\u201cWe made a decision,\u201d James told reporters recently, referring to his family, \u201cthat this was our next journey.\u201dLeBron James will open the 2018-19 season with his third N.B.A. team, the Los Angeles Lakers.\u201cHis home will always be Ohio,\u201d Mark Olivier, one of his former youth coaches, said in an interview. \u201cBut this is a new stage of life for him.\u201dJames\u2019s first exposure to Southern California \u2014 specifically, Southern Californians \u2014 came in the eighth grade, when his summer league team, the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars, took a 20-hour van ride to Orlando, Fla., to play in a national tournament. In the championship game, the Shooting Stars ran into a juggernaut: the Southern California All-Stars, which had several sets of flashy uniforms and the swagger to match. James, who later wrote in a memoir that he thought the California players were ridiculously arrogant, missed a 3-pointer at the buzzer, and his team lost.\u201cI have since been to Southern California many times,\u201d James wrote. \u201cIt is a cool and beautiful place, filled with riches and glamour and secret places hidden in the pockets of the Hollywood Hills. But right then and there, I hated Southern California.\u201dJames wound up making at least two trips to play for the Soldiers, including one for a tournament at California State University, Dominguez Hills, just outside Los Angeles. The secret was out: James was the best high school player in the country.\u201cHe went crazy in that tournament,\u201d Olivier, a former president of the Soldiers, said. \u201cYou could see that the game was just really easy for him.\u201dOlivier said he had hoped to take his players to Disneyland \u2014 they were always talking about it, he said \u2014 but their schedule was packed and traffic was unbearable. So they settled for a water balloon fight at their hotel. Olivier came away with the impression that James enjoyed his time in California.\u201cThe weather,\u201d Olivier said. \u201cThe weather. The weather. We have no seasons here. How can you not like it?\u201dBy the time James was a high school senior, St. Vincent-St. Mary was playing a national schedule \u2014 and charging $15,000 appearance fees. Dinos Trigonis, a talent evaluator in the Los Angeles area who helped put on high-profile high school games, thought the price was worth it to lure the team to Los Angeles to face Mater Dei.Trigonis knew that several players from Mater Dei had played for the Southern California All-Stars, the team that defeated James in the eighth grade. So Trigonis pitched the payback factor to St. Vincent-St. Mary and the team\u2019s coach, Dru Joyce II.\u201cThey never forgot about it,\u201d Trigonis said. \u201cIn their minds, it was almost like a rematch.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about a big, dumb, stupid steak,\u201d he said. \u201cI remember Coach Dru being like, \u2018Yo, that\u2019s a $50 plate!\u2019 But all the seniors were sitting up top, and we looked at each other like, \u2018Man, we don\u2019t want this.\u2019 Afterward, we went to Burger King or something.\u201dStill, James was edging irrevocably closer to the glamour of big-time sports. At his news conference, he was asked about his diamond earrings.\u201cThey cost 25 cents each out of a gumball machine,\u201d he said, deadpan.James\u2019s high school team, St. Vincent-St. Mary, played against Mater Dei at Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles in 2003.At the time, Joyce expressed concern that all the attention was too much, too soon, and that James was easy prey for nefarious forces who did not have the best intentions. After all, James was just a teenager. But he was worth millions.On game day, James dressed at the locker that belonged to Jason Kapono, then a star for U.C.L.A., before taking the court in front of a capacity crowd that included television actors along with agents and sneaker company executives who were jockeying to sign him. \u201cI remember seeing Urkel on the sidelines,\u201d McGee said, referring to a character on \u201cFamily Matters.\u201dThe game, which was broadcast by ESPN2, seemed almost ancillary. James had 21 points, 9 rebounds, 7 assists and 7 turnovers in a 64-58 win. The trip, though, left an impression.\u201cCome on, now,\u201d McGee said. \u201cIt was the dead of winter back home in Ohio, and we got the chance to go to California. Man, we were in love.\u201dA few months after the win against Mater Dei, and a couple of months before the Cleveland Cavaliers made him the top pick in the 2003 N.B.A. draft, James returned to Los Angeles with a group of friends for a playoff game between the Lakers and the San Antonio Spurs.James, who was being courted by potential sponsors, was about to sign a seven-year deal with Nike worth more than $90 million, among the first of many partnerships that would demonstrate his business savvy.James attended the 2003 ESPY Awards in Hollywood.Vince Bucci/Getty ImagesTravis, who came along on the trip \u2014 \u201cThe Lakers got blown out,\u201d he said \u2014 recalled that they stayed at the same hotel as the Spurs, which was a thrill because Tim Duncan was one of his favorite players.Travis, McGee and James still keep in touch via group texts with a few friends from Akron. Travis, who plays pro basketball in the Philippines, said he heard rumblings over the winter that James might go to the Lakers, which did not come as a total surprise.\u201cFor a famous guy, L.A. is one of the best places to be because there are so many other famous people,\u201d Travis said. \u201cIf he walks into a restaurant and there are 10 other famous people there, everyone will be like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s LeBron,\u2019 and they keep going about their day because they\u2019re used to it.\u201dHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s just about a little bit of normalcy, which he hasn\u2019t had since he was 16 years old.\u201dAt the same time, James has numerous business interests based in Los Angeles, including his production company (SpringHill Entertainment) and a digital platform (Uninterrupted). His companies have projects in development with networks like HBO, Starz, Showtime and Netflix. He also plans to exercise his acting chops in a coming reboot of \u201cSpace Jam.\u201dLos Angeles has embraced its new \u201cking.\u201dYet James has consistently fought the perception that he moved here because of Hollywood. It is worth noting that he said he plans to spend his summers in the Akron area, where he still has a home.\u201cMy decision was based solely on my family and the Lakers,\u201d James said. \u201cAs far as my businesses, those things were taken care of long before I came out here to be a part of the Laker franchise.\u201dSo James has another full season ahead of him, with dreams of lifting a new team to familiar heights. He lives with his family in the Brentwood neighborhood, not too far from the beach where, in some ways, long ago, his latest journey began.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "Excited for the \u2018Sabrina\u2019 Reboot? Here\u2019s How the Teenage Witch (and Her Cat) Have Evolved", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byHaving already reinvented Archie and the gang on the CW\u2019s \u201cRiverdale,\u201d the comic book writer and showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa has modernized another classic Archie character: Sabrina Spellman (also known as Sabrina the Teenage Witch), who returns to TV Friday with Netflix\u2019s \u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina.\u201d The series stars Kiernan Shipka of \u201cMad Men\u201d as Sabrina, a young woman struggling to choose between becoming a witch or remaining mortal, as forces of evil conspire against her.The new series is a sharp departure from the lighthearted sitcom high jinks of Sabrina\u2019s previous live-action series, \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch,\u201d starring Melissa Joan Hart. But Sabrina has undergone a lot of reinventions since her debut 56 years ago. Here\u2019s a refresher on her history, both onscreen and on the page.Created by the writer George Gladir and the artist Dan DeCarlo, Sabrina debuted in issue 22 of the comic book series Archie\u2019s Mad House, in 1962. She was introduced as a mischievous teenager who enjoys playing tricks on her classmates. The issue establishes that Sabrina can never fall in love or she will lose her powers (a character trait reminiscent of Kim Novak\u2019s witch in the 1958 film \u201cBell, Book, and Candle\u201d), but that aspect of the character is dropped fairly quickly, as many of her stories involve going on dates and flirting with boys. Later issues reveal that Sabrina lives with her aunts Hilda and Zelda, who look like stereotypical witches \u2014 unlike Sabrina, who dresses as a modern teenager. Sabrina appeared in issues of Archie\u2019s Mad House all through the 1960s before moving to other Archie Comics titles, but she received her biggest boost in visibility after her jump to television.In 1969, Sabrina was introduced to new audiences in an animated TV special titled \u201cArchie and His New Pals.\u201d Soon after, she appeared in recurring segments on \u201cThe Archie Comedy Hour,\u201d in which the character tries to use her magic to solve problems while hiding from Archie and his friends that she is a witch. In 1970, Sabrina received a spinoff, \u201cSabrina and the Groovie Goolies,\u201d in which she encounters wacky situations involving the Goolies, a group of monsters based on Frankenstein\u2019s monster, Dracula, a mummy and a wolf man. The Goolies were later spun off into their own series, and Sabrina\u2019s show was retitled as the first \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch.\u201dIn 1996, a TV pilot film of \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch\u201d starring Melissa Joan Hart (and featuring the future \u201cDeadpool\u201d Ryan Reynolds) debuted on Showtime. The pilot was picked up for a series by ABC, but most of the film\u2019s cast was jettisoned except for Hart. The series began on Sept. 27 that year, and it was seen by more than 17 million viewers. It was the highest-rated series in ABC\u2019s T.G.I.F. lineup for the next four years.In this version, Sabrina is the daughter of a male witch and a human, and she discovers she\u2019s a witch on her 16th birthday. Partly because of a curse, Sabrina is unable to be with her parents, so she lives with her aunts Hilda (Caroline Rhea) and Zelda (Beth Broderick). A typical episode might feature Sabrina trying to use her powers and having them backfire, usually resulting in some sort of life lesson. Several details from the live-action series were later added to the comics: In addition to Sabrina\u2019s half-mortal parentage, her cat, Salem, who in the comics was a regular orange tabby, became a talking black cat, and Hilda and Zelda were turned into normal-looking people. The show ran for four seasons on ABC before it was canceled and picked up by the WB, which aired its final three.While the live-action series was airing on ABC, a Saturday morning cartoon titled \u201cSabrina: The Animated Series\u201d was also produced. This series was more directly inspired by the comics, with Sabrina portrayed as a middle schooler who already knows about her witch ancestry. The show did retain Salem as a talking cat, however. Hart\u2019s younger sister, Emily, played Sabrina, while Melissa voiced Hilda and Zelda. The series ran for 65 episodes but was canceled from ABC around the same time ABC canceled the live action \u201cSabrina.\u201d Sabrina went on to make a few more animated appearances in \u201cSabrina\u2019s Secret Life\u201d from 2003 to 2004 and \u201cSabrina: Secrets of a Teenage Witch\u201d from 2013 to 2014, although neither show achieved the success or popularity of earlier series.The new Sabrina series has its roots in recent comic history. In 2013, Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa began writing Afterlife With Archie, a horror series in which Riverdale is plagued by a zombie outbreak caused after Sabrina uses her magic to resurrect Jughead\u2019s dog from the dead. The series was filled with gore and graphic violence, and it was a huge success. Aguirre-Sacasa followed it up with another mature horror series titled \u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina.\u201d The book features a 1960s-era Sabrina dealing with becoming a witch while being targeted by Madame Satan, an evil witch who is seeking revenge on the Spellman family. Aguirre-Sacasa was hired as Archie Comics\u2019 chief creative officer in 2014, and he developed \u201cRiverdale\u201d for the CW, which debuted three years later. Many fans expected that Sabrina would eventually make an appearance on the show, but instead a new series, based on \u201cChilling Adventures,\u201d was created for Netflix. Longtime Sabrina fans may be shocked by \u201cChilling Adventures\u201d (especially with all of the Satan hailing), but the new series gives Sabrina a refreshing new essence.Advertisement"}

Yes, let\u2019s walk instead of take a car service. Yes, I can traipse around the city and still catch my plane back to Los Angeles later that evening. Yes, I can hop the temporary barricade around the LGBT memorial to get a closer look.Among his many triumphs on \u201cQueer Eye\u201d \u2014 where, in each episode, five tasteful gay men make over a messy subject \u2014 Mr. Berk transformed an empty church hall into a bustling community center and turned the disarrayed home of a Burning Man devotee into a polished bachelor pad. Now filming a third season in Kansas City, Mo., the Fab Five (as the cast members are known) still radiate empathy, and Mr. Berk still enjoys posing for a selfie. The beard is new, but it can\u2019t hide his smile.\u201cSort of like the LGBT community,\u201d Mr. Berk said. \u201cThey\u2019re not like everybody else. It\u2019s that rainbow, that shimmer of light that makes us different.\u201dMr. Berk, 37, grew up in rural Missouri. Design was an outlet from what he described as an oppressive upbringing in the Assemblies of God Church, and he redid homes for friends as he got older. Eventually he moved to New York City and became the creative director of Portico, the luxury design company that began in SoHo.Climbing the High Line stairs at Gansevoort Street, Mr. Berk was amazed to see the lush plantings and the new luxury buildings that hovered over the park. None of this was here in 2003, when he lived around the corner with a view of abandoned tracks.\u201cWhen you think about what this was 100 years ago, industrial, polluted, chaotic \u2026,\u201d Mr. Berk said, looking past the sculpture, toward the Hudson River that sparkled between buildings. \u201cAnd now it\u2019s this oasis.\u201dIn the midst of his smelling fest, a young woman banged on the window and mouthed, \u201cI love you\u201d to Mr. Berk. He mouthed, \u201cI love you\u201d right back.Compared to Flatiron district giants like Bed Bath & Beyond and Restoration Hardware, where Mr. Berk worked long ago, the place reminded him of old-time boutiques and their employees who \u201cknew everything about every little gadget.

A monumental jade-colored staircase led to a public space where at least 20 visitors typed furiously on laptops among Turkish-rug-covered couches, eggplant ombr\u00e9 Italian Renaissance columns and what felt like a jungle of plants.In this building, too, was the Afro-Caribbean-inspired Broken Shaker, a rooftop bar with batik-patterned cloth wallpaper, tiki mugs, miniature 1950s dance party scenes and nautical needlepoint. A hallway off the bar was covered in floor-to-ceiling graffiti and had dangling straw lanterns.\u201cThe thing I love about The Freehand,\u201d Mr. Berk said, \u201cis nothing goes together but everything goes together.\u201dTaste and smell deluged the space, but the luxury fabrics and furniture, washed with light streaming through the tall windows, were also a bounty of sight and touch. \u201cIt\u2019s a full experience,\u201d Mr. Berk said. \u201cIt has an effect on all five of your senses.\u201dWe dropped by a streetwear mecca where we felt very \u2014 how shall I say? \u2014 unattended to.

Cheese.\u201d But one difference is their scale of operations. While Mr. Murakami has dozens of employees in Tokyo, FriendsWithYou currently has three people on its payroll here. (That\u2019s not counting Mr. Sandoval\u2019s 12-year-old daughter, who, he said, \u201ccould send me a big invoice one day for being our R&D all this time.\u201d)\u201cWe both really like making things; we like being in the studio,\u201d Mr. Borkson said. Of the two men, he\u2019s more likely to try to contextualize their work in terms of Nicolas Bourriaud\u2019s theory of \u201crelational aesthetics\u201d or Alejandro Jodorowsky\u2019s \u201cpsychomagic.\u201d At one point, he also insisted that Little Cloud was \u201ca sweet gift of love but also gangsta and powerful.\u201d It\u2019s \u201ca strong and assertive way of spreading love,\u201d he said.They ended up partying together. \u201cWe were almost like ravers, doing these drugs to have an out-of-body experience, especially through music,\u201d Mr. Sandoval said. \u201cHow do we create these euphoric sensations, minus the drugs?\u201dThey started by making plush toys, hand-sewn creatures that they called \u201camulets,\u201d with a nod to their supposed healing powers. People were in the market for good luck, and Tower Records placed an order for 10,000 in 2002. In 2005, Bonnie Clearwater at the Museum of Contemporary Art in North Miami gave them a show: They created what would become the first in a line of colorful, tactile museum playrooms. But museumgoers were not their only audience, and their gallery history has been anything but straightforward; various dealers, including Emmanuel Perrotin, Paul Kasmin, Jeffrey Deitch and Kathy Grayson at The Hole, have played roles at different points.Since partnering with the Toronto-based Guru Studio in 2012 to create the show, the artists have stayed involved with \u201cTrue\u201d well beyond the pilot and are still designing new characters and writing premises for stories. \u201cThey wanted to teach the ABCs and 123s,\u201d Mr. Borkson said. \u201cAnd we wanted to teach love and empathy.\u201d \u201cA rainbow is so magical,\u201d Mr. Sandoval said. \u201cFor us it\u2019s this metaphysical and spiritual symbol about believing in something larger than yourself.\u201dThe artists plan to carry the rainbow together, each supporting one end, so it\u2019s also a symbol of their partnership.

{"Headline": "Apple News\u2019s Radical Approach: Humans Over Machines", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byIn a quiet corner of the third floor, Apple is building a newsroom of sorts. About a dozen former journalists have filled a few nondescript offices to do what many other tech companies have for years left to software: selecting the news that tens of millions of people will read.One morning in late August, Apple News\u2019s editor in chief, Lauren Kern, huddled with a deputy to discuss the five stories to feature atop the company\u2019s three-year-old news app, which comes preinstalled on every iPhone in the United States, Britain and Australia.\u201cWe put so much care and thought into our curation,\u201d said Ms. Kern, 43, a former executive editor of New York Magazine. \u201cIt\u2019s seen by a lot of people and we take that responsibility really seriously.\u201dThe former journalist has quietly become one of the most powerful figures in English-language media. The stories she and her deputies select for Apple News regularly receive more than a million visits each.Their work has complicated the debate about whether Silicon Valley giants are media or technology companies. Google, Facebook and Twitter have long insisted they are tech entities and not arbiters of the truth. The chief executive of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, and others have bet heavily on artificial intelligence to help them sort through false news and fact-based information. Yet Apple has unabashedly gone the other direction with its human-led approach, showing that a more media-like sensibility may be able to coexist within a technology company.Apple\u2019s strategy is risky. While the company has long used people to curate its App Store, the news is far more contentious. The famously secretive company has also provided little transparency on who is picking the stories for Apple News and how those people avoid bias.For the first time recently \u2014 and after extensive negotiations on the terms of the interviews \u2014 Apple agreed to let a Times reporter in on how it operates Apple News.There are ambitious plans for the product. Apple lets publishers run ads in its app and it helps some sign up new subscribers, taking a 30 percent cut of the revenue. Soon, the company aims to bundle access to dozens of magazines in its app for a flat monthly fee, sort of like Netflix for news, according to people familiar with the plans, who declined to be identified because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. Apple also hopes to package access to a few daily-news publications, like The Times, The Post and The Wall Street Journal, into the app, the people said.Apple\u2019s executives grandly proclaim that they want to help save journalism. \u201cThere is this deep understanding that a thriving free press is critical for an informed public, and an informed public is critical for a functioning democracy, and that Apple News can play a part in that,\u201d Ms. Kern said.But there are early signs that Apple is not the industry\u2019s savior. Many publishers have made little on ads in Apple News, and Apple\u2019s 30 percent cut of subscriptions it helps sell does not help. Having experienced Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s disruption of their industry, many publications are wary of Apple, according to conversations with executives from nine news organizations, many of whom declined to comment on the record for fear of upsetting the trillion-dollar corporation. Some were optimistic that Apple could be a better partner than other tech giants, but were leery of making the company the portal to their readers.\u201cWhat Apple giveth, Apple can taketh away,\u201d said Bill Grueskin, a Columbia University journalism professor and a former editor at The Journal, Bloomberg and other publications. Once readers are trained to get their news from Apple, he said, news organizations will realize: \u201cYou\u2019re at the mercy of Apple.\u201dFor decades, newspapers had one of industry\u2019s most direct relationships with customers: Broadsheets and tabloids reported the news, printed it and delivered it to your door.Then the internet arrived, and Google and Facebook became the middlemen between publishers and their readers, while leveraging that position to dominate digital advertising and decimate newspapers\u2019 advertising business model.The rise of Google and Facebook in news was partly driven by algorithms that provided enormous scale, enabling them to surface millions of articles from thousands of sources to their billions of users. The algorithms were largely designed to keep users engaged and clicking, meaning they tended to promote posts that drew clicks and shares, which often meant the sensational. That elevated fringe and partisan sites that produced intentionally misleading, highly partisan or downright false content.(A Google spokeswoman said the company aimed to avoid misinformation by screening publishers before letting them into Google News. She added that Google this year began helping news organizations sell subscriptions. A Facebook spokeswoman said the company helps publishers reach more readers, earn ad revenue and sell subscriptions. She said Facebook\u2019s algorithm recently decreased the visibility of pages that share clickbait.)Into that environment came Apple. In late 2015, the iPhone maker released a free news app to match users with publications they liked. People selected their interests and favorite publications, and the app returned a feed of relevant stories.The announcement attracted little fanfare. Three months later, Apple announced an unusual new feature: humans would pick the app\u2019s top stories, not algorithms.Apple said it remained convinced of the benefits of people.\u201cWe are responsible for what\u2019s in there,\u201d Roger Rosner, Apple\u2019s chief of apps and Ms. Kern\u2019s boss, said about Apple News. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to let it be a total crazy land.\u201dTo create its newsroom, Apple needed journalists. Starting in 2015, it poached editors from The Times, The Journal, CNN and Bleacher Report, among other publications. To lead them all, an Apple recruiter found Ms. Kern, a rising star in the New York magazine world.\u201cYou don\u2019t generally have the whole package, but she did,\u201d Adam Moss, New York Magazine\u2019s editor in chief, said of Ms. Kern\u2019s news judgment, story ideas and work ethic.Last year, Mr. Moss said, Ms. Kern came into his office with the news that Apple had approached her about a job.\u201cI said to her, \u2018Why would you want to do that?\u2019\u201d recalled Mr. Moss. \u201cWith the literary skills and the artistic skills Lauren had, to go into a company that was really dominated by engineers was a recipe for enormous frustration.\u201dMs. Kern said it was an opportunity to help journalism from the other side. Going to tech also came with a raise; she would not say how much. She moved from Brooklyn to one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most expensive ZIP codes, where she bought a car for the first time in 13 years, a golden retriever named Leo for her son, and a spacious house with chicken coops in the back. (She plans to leave the coops empty.)In interviews, Ms. Kern was lighthearted but matter of fact. Friends and former colleagues described her as fiercely dedicated to two things: her son and her job.\u201cShe has an executive\u2019s brain. Most places I work, journalists are such poor managers,\u201d said Noreen Malone, a former colleague at New York Magazine. \u201cIt was always clear Lauren was going to run something.\u201dNow Ms. Kern leads roughly 30 former journalists in Sydney, London, New York and Silicon Valley. They spend their days consuming news across the internet, fielding 100 to 200 pitches a day from publishers, and debating which stories get the top spots.Ultimately, they select five stories to lead the app, with the top two also displayed in a prominent window to the left of the iPhone home screen. They also curate a magazine-style section of feature stories. The lineup typically shifts five or more times a day, depending on the news. A single editor in London typically chooses the first mix of stories for the East Coast\u2019s morning commute before editors in New York and then Cupertino step in.Ms. Kern said she and her team did not run the story because they didn\u2019t trust it. Why? It\u2019s not a formula that can be baked into an algorithm, she said.\u201cI mean, you read a story and it doesn\u2019t quite pass the smell test,\u201d she said.Ms. Kern criticized the argument that algorithms are the sole way to avoid prejudice because bias can be baked into the algorithm\u2019s code, such as whether it labels news organizations liberal or conservative. She argued that humans \u2014 with all their biases \u2014 are the only way to avoid bias.\u201cWe\u2019re so much more subtly following the news cycle and what\u2019s important,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the only legitimate way to do it at this point.\u201dApple executives said they are convinced that Apple News is not only a cure for the ills of how people consume news in the internet era, but also a lifeline for journalism \u2014 and democracy.\u201cFrom the very beginning, Tim said we have a responsibility to help the news industry,\u201d said Mr. Rosner, referring to Apple\u2019s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental to democracy.\u201dIn actual newsrooms, there is skepticism that a tech giant will rescue the industry.Daniel Hallac, chief product officer for New York Magazine, said traffic from Apple News has doubled since December to now account for nearly 12 percent of visits to the magazine\u2019s website. Traffic from Facebook has dropped about a third, to 8 percent of visits, while Google\u2019s share has increased slightly to nearly half of the site\u2019s traffic. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic about Apple News,\u201d he said.Eddy Cue, Apple\u2019s senior vice president who oversees its services push, said publishers can run their own ads alongside their stories in Apple News and keep all of the revenue. \u201cThat\u2019s very rare,\u201d he said. He noted most major publishers take advantage of that feature. Apple also places ads for publishers for a 30 percent cut.But news publishers said selling ads for Apple News is complicated, and that advertisers\u2019 interest was limited because of the lack of customer data. Slate also attributed its issues to minuscule revenue from the ads Apple placed. Apple recently made it easier for publishers to place their own ads, but Mr. Cue conceded Apple is not terribly good \u2014 or interested \u2014 in advertising.Another potential issue is that Apple News mostly helps a small coterie of publishers. In July, Florida\u2019s largest newspaper, The Tampa Bay Times, received 79 percent of its outside web traffic from Google and 20 percent from Facebook, said Conan Gallaty, the paper\u2019s digital chief. Apple accounted for 1 percent, he said.\u201cOf the major three \u2014 Facebook, Google and Apple \u2014 Apple probably kept the furthest distance in engaging with regional and local publishers,\u201d he said.Mr. Cue said Apple is most interested in helping publishers sell subscriptions. Apple News now enables people to subscribe at the tap of a finger, leveraging many iPhone owners\u2019 preloaded credit cards.But there is concern here, too. Apple nabs 30 percent of subscription revenues the first year and 15 percent each subsequent year. In contrast, Google takes a 5 percent cut; Facebook takes nothing. Apple also owns the customer relationship, unlike Google or Facebook, refusing to pass along even subscribers\u2019 email addresses.Given those terms, some news executives said Apple News could cannibalize future subscribers, leaving news organizations with less revenue and less data per customer.Mr. Cue said Apple primarily delivers customers who wouldn\u2019t have subscribed otherwise and that its revenue share was \u201ca relatively small cut,\u201d in part to offset its costs. \u201cIt\u2019s not a huge moneymaking business,\u201d he said.In April, Apple bought Texture, an app that lets readers pay $10 a month for access to about 200 magazines. It now plans to incorporate the service into Apple News, drastically expanding its reach, according to people familiar with its plans.Given Apple\u2019s ambitions and growing team of former journalists, will it ever start producing the news and not just aggregating it?\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about future plans, but that\u2019s certainly not what we set out to do,\u201d said Mr. Rosner.So there\u2019s a chance?\u201cWho knows?\u201d he said.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "\u2018Bodyguard\u2019 Was a Sensation in Britain. But Can It Conquer America?", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBut two months ago, the country found a way to come together, heal the divisions and ignore the politicians. Well, the real ones at least.The BBC One series \u201cBodyguard,\u201d written by Jed Mercurio (\u201cLine of Duty\u201d), debuted here in late August, drawing more than 10 million television viewers over seven days for its first episode, the largest audience for a new drama on British TV since \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d You may never have heard of this show, which stars Richard Madden (\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d) and Keeley Hawes (\u201cThe Durrells in Corfu\u201d), but it had Britain riveted.Unfolding in unfashionable weekly installments, \u201cBodyguard\u201d fueled nonstop speculation in the British media about the twists, turns, implications and resolution of its hall-of-mirrors plot, which involves an Afghanistan war veteran assigned to guard the chilly and ambitious home secretary, together with assorted terrorist threats and back-stabbing political intrigue.Do you care? Should you care? Why was it so popular in Britain? Will it hit the same cultural nerve in the United States? Here is a spoiler-free guide to who\u2019s who, what\u2019s what and some theories (O.K., speculation) about why \u201cBodyguard\u201d kept the Brits riveted.David Budd (Richard Madden), a former soldier, is assigned as the protection officer for Britain\u2019s home secretary, Julia Montague (Keeley Hawes). Budd is estranged from his wife, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and angry about the decision to send British troops to Afghanistan, which Montague supported.A quick succession of high-adrenaline events is woven into lower-key intrigue that includes venomous rivalry between the police and the secret service, and a mysterious document that may implicate someone very high up in government and allow Montague to make a grab for power. Sexual tension makes an obligatory, steamy appearance. Meanwhile, the poker-faced Budd remains mostly inscrutable. Is he really protecting Montague? Or does he intend to use his position to take revenge for Afghanistan?There isn\u2019t an exact correspondence in the United States government. The home secretary in Britain is responsible for immigration, citizenship, policing and all matters of national security, making him or her an extremely senior figure in government.Another bit of British terminology: MI5, known as the Security Service, is responsible for domestic intelligence, like the F.B.I. Together with the police, the service reports to the home secretary. In \u201cBodyguard,\u201d the director general of MI5, the snaky Stephen Hunter-Dunn (Stuart Bowman), is engaged in a bitter fight for territorial control with Commander Anne Sampson (Gina McKee), the head of the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command.In a telephone interview, Madden said he was \u201cabsolutely blown away\u201d by the success of \u201cBodyguard.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still catching up with the extent of it,\u201d he said, adding that the show touched on \u201ca lot of subjects we can relate to around privacy; how much right the government have to read your texts and emails, how that would play out.\u201dMark Lawson, a culture columnist for The Guardian, attributed the show\u2019s success to its blend of gripping narrative and salaciousness. \u201cBodyguard\u201d combines \u201cthe most popular genres in British TV\u201d \u2014 the crime drama and the conspiracy thriller \u2014 while \u201calso incorporating the always popular subplot of forbidden sex,\u201d he wrote in an email.Mercurio\u2019s \u201cexceptional gift for tension\u201d is enhanced by a reputation for killing off major figures in early episodes of a series, Lawson said. \u201cThe viewer sitting down to watch \u2018Bodyguard\u2019 was nervously aware that the \u2018James Bond Rule\u2019 \u2014 the protagonist must survive to play another day \u2014 may not apply.\u201dMercurio himself didn\u2019t seem to have any particular theory about why \u201cBodyguard\u201d had resonated so widely in Britain. \u201cThere is always a measure of good fortune about these things,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. Although he had wanted to write about the world of politics, he said he hadn\u2019t used Brexit as a backdrop since it would have been \u201cimpossible to predict what political events would be happening.\u201d Instead, he said, he chose to focus on national security.One theory holds that despite the topical themes, the key to the show\u2019s popularity lies in its escapism \u2014 it was a relief to watch a world in which Brexit doesn\u2019t exist, and a lone hero can resolve all problems (except his own, of course) in time-honored action-star fashion.But Brexit angst probably figures into it somehow. \u201cIt\u2019s set in a version of Westminster in which not only can no politicians trust each other, but neither can any of them rely on the police or the spies,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cMy hunch is that future historians will find the huge success of \u2018Bodyguard\u2019 a reflection of the \u2018trust no one\u2019 mood in U.K. culture in this period.\u201dOne big difference for United States audiences is that Netflix will release all the episodes of \u201cBodyguard\u201d simultaneously, whereas British audiences largely watched the show from week to week, with cliffhangers building chatter and suspense. \u201cWe are all in the same time zone here, and it reminded everyone of that lost pleasure of picking over the same hour of TV,\u201d said Piers Wengers, the BBC executive in charge of dramas.British television drama, Wengers said, is built on the traditions of British theater and on heavily serialized narrative, often written by one person. \u201cYou get a single vision,\u201d he said. \u201cI think \u2018Bodyguard\u2019 had the time-honored trick of forcing viewers to lean in and think about what would happen next.\u201dMercurio said he hoped storytelling would prevail even if watching habits were different. \u201cIt\u2019s very fast-paced with lots of thrills,\u201d he said. \u201cI would hope that\u2019s what people respond to.\u201dAdvertisement"}

(And have you spotted all the ghosts?) Share your thoughts in the comments section, and read what everyone else is saying.Shirley Jackson\u2019s 1959 novel \u201cThe Haunting of Hill House,\u201d a ghost story about a mansion plagued by paranormal events, has been adapted for the big screen twice, in 1963 and 1999 (both films were called simply \u201cThe Haunting\u201d). Earlier this month, Netflix released the book\u2019s first TV adaptation, a 10-episode series created by the horror filmmaker Mike Flanagan. In Flanagan\u2019s retelling, a couple and their five children take up temporary residence in Hill House, an experience that ends in bizarre tragedy; 26 years later, the grown children and their estranged father reunite and attempt to make sense of the supernatural phenomenon they encountered all those years before.Katie Rife argues that, terrifying though the show may be, what makes it so effective is the deep sadness rendered by Flanagan\u2019s thematic focus on generational trauma and mental illness. But if you\u2019re looking for pure scares, don\u2019t worry: \u201cEpisode five,\u201d Rife writes, \u201cwhich details a woman\u2019s lifelong torment at the hands of a buzzing black void in the shape of a nightmarishly mangled woman known as the Bent-Neck Lady, had this writer sleeping with the lights on for the first time in years.\u201dComparing the series with the novel, Sophie Gilbert is more critical, noting that this latest adaptaion \u201cabandons Jackson\u2019s distinctly female gothic for a more generic examination of grief and trauma.\u201d The series is \u201cstylish, moving, and sinister,\u201d she continues, adding, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard not to feel like something has been lost in translation \u2014 that horror as a genre, bereft as it is of female voices, is missing what actually terrifies many of us.\u201dMiles Surrey compares the show to a spookier version of the NBC drama \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d noting that both series are centered on a family that is grieving the death of a parent. Surrey writes, \u201cWhether or not actual ghosts are manifesting around them \u2014 the series frequently has ghosts lurking in the background of shots, if only to freak you out even more \u2014 the Crain family is haunted by grief, unspoken anxieties, and shame, which only builds up over the years as everyone avoids each other.\u201dThe series\u2019s source material is considered one of the 20th century\u2019s finest horror novels \u2014 and maybe the definitive haunted house story. Here, The Times\u2019s Books desk compiled a list of 13 other works centered on haunted houses, from Henry James\u2019s \u201cThe Turn of the Screw\u201d to Stephen King\u2019s \u201cThe Shining.\u201dThe Bent-Neck Lady is a spectral figure who features in the fifth episode, to the apparent horror of every viewer who endured this particularly chilling hour. At Slate, Sam Adams has a spoiler-heavy analysis of the ghost and her significance to the story.Flanagan tells The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Mike Bloom that he loved both the original novel and the 1963 film adaptation by Robert Wise. Flanagan describes his thought process when Netflix approached him about turning it into a series: \u201cI went back through the book, and I figured the only way through the woods was [that] we were going to need a much larger character palette to carry a series. I\u2019m just naturally drawn to family drama, and I think in horror, in particular, the way people behave in their families is different than the way they behave out in the world. It strips away all the pretext.\u201dMichiel Huisman tells Jennifer Vineyard that filming the series was almost as spooky as watching it: \u201cMike Flanagan basically told us from the beginning that whenever we\u2019re shooting on the set of \u2018Hill House,\u2019 we would have a couple of ghosts on hand, in full makeup,\u201d Huisman says. He continues: \u201cSometimes, all of a sudden after take four, I would look around and finally see someone, and I\u2019d be like, \u2018What?! Has that person been standing there the whole time?\u2019\u201dAdvertisement"}

He was 76.His death was confirmed on Sunday in a statement by the Screen Actors Guild. It provided no other details. Some news reports said that he had died at his home in Los Angeles and that he had had leukemia.Mr. Wilson\u2019s breakout role was as the murderer Richard Hickock in \u201cIn Cold Blood,\u201d a 1967 adaptation of Truman Capote\u2019s book by the same title. It was his second film.The book recounted the murder of four people on their farm in Holcomb, Kan., in 1959 by Mr. Hickock and Perry Smith, two petty criminals who had mistakenly thought that there was a safe on the premises stuffed with money.The director, Richard Brooks, shooting on location in Holcomb, filmed the murder scenes in the actual farmhouse where the killings had taken place. He also purposely selected little-known actors, Mr. Wilson and Robert Blake, to play the killers.\u201cBrooks wanted to create a film so unique to itself and so realistic that no one would relate it to movie stars,\u201d Mr. Wilson told The Independent of London in 2000. \u201cI think he would have been happier if he could have hanged us at the end of the film so we couldn\u2019t talk about it.\u201dThe film was well received by critics. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times praised the performances of Mr. Wilson and Mr. Blake.\u201cTheir abilities to demonstrate the tensions, the torments and the shabby conceits of the miserable criminals give disturbing dimensions to their roles,\u201d Mr. Crowther wrote.More recent audiences know Mr. Wilson as Hershel Greene, a veterinarian and farmer, on \u201cThe Walking Dead,\u201d which follows a group of survivors in the American South after much of the population has been turned into a horde of ravenous zombies.Greene first appeared in 2011 during the show\u2019s second season, when he agreed to let the central group of survivors take shelter on his farm. When the farm is overrun by zombies, he accompanies them to a former prison. He becomes a moral authority on the show, stern but kind, and loses a leg after he is bitten by one of the undead. The character was killed at the end of the show\u2019s fourth season.The first episode of the ninth season aired on Sunday night. Angela Kang, \u201cThe Walking Dead\u2019s\u201d showrunner, announced during a panel at New York Comic Con on Saturday that Hershel would make a cameo appearance at some point during the season.Mr. Wilson was born in Atlanta on March 29, 1942. His father was a building contractor who wanted him to be an architect or an engineer, and who died when Mr. Wilson was young.He studied architecture in Georgia but dropped out before completing his undergraduate degree, deciding to hitchhike to California to study acting. He acted in local theater there until his first movie role, as a murder suspect in Norman Jewison\u2019s \u201cIn the Heat of the Night\u201d (1967). \u201cIn Cold Blood\u201d was released later that year.Mr. Wilson appeared in several dozen more films, including \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d (1974), \u201cThe Right Stuff\u201d (1983), \u201cDead Man Walking\u201d (1995), \u201cThe Last Samurai\u201d (2003) and \u201cMonster\u201d (2003).He played a cruel dog-owner in three movies based on Phyllis Reynolds Naylor\u2019s \u201cShiloh\u201d novels, and Saint Albert Chmielowski in \u201cOur God\u2019s Brother\u201d (1997), a film adaptation, by the Polish director Krzysztof Zanussiof, of a play written by Pope John Paul II.Mr. Wilson also had recurring parts on the CBS police procedural \u201cCSI: Crime Scene Investigation\u201d and Netflix\u2019s science fiction drama \u201cThe OA.\u201dHis survivors include his wife, Heavenly (Koh) Wilson.\u201cI\u2019ve played killers, and I\u2019ve played saints,\u201d Mr. Wilson told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2006. \u201cIt\u2019s been an interesting life.\u201dDoris Burke contributed research.Follow Daniel E.

It\u2019s a very different viewing experience, however.\u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d was a ready-made, a stranger-than-fiction saga that provided foolproof drama while benefiting greatly from Ms. Demos and Ms. Ricciardi\u2019s meticulous and exhaustive approach. (After serving 18 years in prison for sexual assault and being exonerated by DNA evidence, Mr. Avery was arrested and convicted in the murder of Teresa Halbach and imprisoned again, this time for life; his then-teenage nephew was also convicted in Ms. Halbach\u2019s murder.)Part 2 takes place with both men offscreen, their presence limited to prison telephone calls, and the trials and police investigations that filled much of the first season are seen only in flashback snippets. Its movement is incremental and quotidian, reflecting the torturous process of filing appeals and re-examining forensic evidence. That\u2019s another way of saying that it\u2019s slow, especially through the first four or five of its 10 episodes (which stretch across 10\u00bd hours).It\u2019s also more self-consciously constructed. It has an A plot, in which Mr. Avery\u2019s new lawyer, Kathleen Zellner, a specialist in post-conviction exonerations, conducts an exhaustive re-examination of his case. And it has a B plot, in which Mr. Dassey\u2019s lawyers try to prove that he was convicted because of a coerced confession. Bridging the two are scenes with the men\u2019s intertwined families that can be repetitive but at their best are powerfully emotional.Ms. Zellner, tough and smart in equal measure, is Part 2\u2019s star. At first the long discussions of ballistics and blood stains she conducts with her cadre of experts can be eye-glazing, but by the fifth episode the investigation kicks into gear. Over the second half of the season, Ms. Zellner develops a set of plausible alternative theories and suspects that provide the kind of sensational twists \u2014 in theory at least \u2014 that drew people into the original.The season\u2019s identification with the supremely confident Ms. Zellner\u2019s point of view is so complete that you may not notice right away how much time she spends sliming people \u2014 prosecutors, cops, potential suspects, other lawyers. More problematic, if you care to think about it, is the way in which the show\u2019s focus on detection and questions of criminal justice takes the focus almost entirely away from Ms. Halbach, the victim.Ms. Demos and Ms. Ricciardi are not great stylists, and \u201cMaking a Murderer\u201d often dulls out tonally and visually, locked into an unvarying mood of melancholic Americana \u2014 somber guitar music, lights going out in lonely houses at dusk. Someone else might make a spikier, darker show out of this material.But their method gathers force and pays off over time. They\u2019re especially attuned to Mr. Avery\u2019s steadfastly loyal parents, Dolores and Allan, whose declining health and spirits are the emotional core of Part 2 \u2014 a wasting away in tragic rhythm with their imprisoned son. It\u2019s a semi-spoiler, for the viewer not aware of Mr. Avery\u2019s and Mr. Dassey\u2019s current fates, to note that even Ms. Zellner has to work to put on a brave face by the end of Part 2.

Both are still in prison.With \u201cMaking a Murderer Part 2,\u201d new players are introduced, like Avery\u2019s new star lawyer, Kathleen Zellner, who joined the case after Avery became famous, bringing an arsenal of creative tactics. Laura Nirider and Steven Drizin, Dassey\u2019s post-conviction lawyers, are also prominent.Why did you decide to continue with the story of Steven Avery for new episodes, rather than look at a new case?What convinced you that there was indeed something more to point a camera at?With Kathleen Zellner, we had this character that we recognized could really be the engine of the story moving forward. She does not work her case from behind the desk. She goes to the crime scene; she gets the evidence; she gets experts involved. And she, herself, is doing nothing but asking questions and trying to find answers.

But all that changes when 5-year-old Jimmy (Parker Sevak) recites a poem of his own \u2014 \u201cThe sun hits her yellow house/It is almost like a sign from God\u201d \u2014 while waiting to be picked up from school. His words, spoken in a trance-like state, rouse Lisa\u2019s creative aspirations, and she decides to nurture his gifts like a young Mozart: waking him from nap time for tutoring, writing down his every stanza, taking over his after-school care from his perpetually late babysitter, who is interested in him only slightly more than his absent, divorced parents. Meanwhile, she co-opts his poetry as her own, stirring excitement in the professor (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) who\u2019d hardly noticed her before.Most concertgoers are familiar with Hector Berlioz\u2019s \u201cSymphonie Fantastique,\u201d that psychedelic, orchestral odyssey of unrequited love not-so-loosely based on the composer\u2019s own creepy obsessions. But few are aware that Berlioz also composed a sequel to the repertoire staple, which he designated to be performed directly after the symphony concluded. It is understandable that this work, \u201cL\u00e9lio,\u201d is rarely heard, given that it requires an additional chorus and vocal soloists, who are hidden behind a curtain for most of the piece. Subtitled \u201cThe Return to Life,\u201d \u201cL\u00e9lio\u201d orients around a spoken monologue in which the hero of \u201cSymphonie Fantastique\u201d awakens from his hallucinatory dreams, finds happiness and resolves to compose a new piece \u2014 which the ensemble then plays. A gigantic new commission from the Ghanaian sculptor El Anatsui and a \u201chammock cafe,\u201d constructed by Joan Jonas and the Ho Chi Minh City-based collective Art Labor, are among the works by 32 artists and groups featured in the 2018 Carnegie International, the latest edition of Pittsburgh\u2019s century-old art show.Their new collaboration, \u201cJACK &,\u201d created with Christopher Myers, is about going forth into not death but life \u2014 the wider, freer, sometimes more perplexing world that awaits people when they get out of prison and need to shape a fresh place for themselves in society. Starring Mr. Alston as a formerly incarcerated baker, it\u2019s a multimedia dreamscape that mixes monologue, comic duets and dance.Advertisement"}

Seinfeld, who was wary of advice from the prosaic company brass, nonetheless agreed that a \u201creal female character\u201d was essential.Decades later, Seinfeld recalled his good luck here Sunday night at the Kennedy Center as Louis-Dreyfus accepted the Mark Twain Prize, considered the top honor in comedy, for a career that has continually tested the boundaries traditionally set for women in the field.\u201cI could not get enough of her,\u201d Seinfeld said of their partnership on screen. \u201cThat whole time, nine years, I was not acting. I couldn\u2019t.\u201dOn Sunday, Louis-Dreyfus became the sixth woman to receive the Mark Twain Prize in its 20-year history, a theme that threaded through the ceremony.\u201cIn the early \u201990s, at a time on network TV when actresses were expected to have great timing and great tans and great eating disorders, Julia made the bold choice for her character Elaine Benes to wear long, loose dresses, flat shoes and oversized coats,\u201d Fey said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t need to give us midriff.\u201dAnd there were Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson, stars of the Comedy Central show \u201cBroad City,\u201d who credited Louis-Dreyfus with their own comedic confidence.\u201cJulia, you lead the charge for authentic and flawed female characters in comedy,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cEvery time you create a character, you open a door, a door for another generation of young women to goofily walk through.\u201d\u201cShe hung out with the guys, but without changing who she was to please them,\u201d Glazer said.The two filmed an elaborate sketch with a professional dance troupe practicing the signature Elaine Benes dance, then brought the troupe on stage for a final performance. (The dancers\u2019 attempt to engage the crowd \u2014 which skewed older \u2014 failed.)The actress Ellie Kemper of the Netflix show \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d spoke in a video tribute about that same influence, noting how important it was that Louis-Dreyfus also produced \u201cVeep.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s crucial that women have those positions, to promote women,\u201d she said.The comedian Keegan-Michael Key said that \u201cmen have it easy. It\u2019s the women like Julia who have fought to create the path for other women to follow. Open doors, change the dynamic.\u201dSome tributes tripped over the very tropes they were trying to mock, perhaps intentionally.\u201cShe was one of the guys,\u201d George Shapiro, one of the producers of \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d said in a video tribute.The other women who have received the Mark Twain Prize are Whoopi Goldberg, Lily Tomlin, Ellen DeGeneres and Carol Burnett.The ceremony for Louis-Dreyfus made frequent allusions to politics. Fey mentioned that she and Louis-Dreyfus \u201cboth won Emmys for people who should never be vice president,\u201d referring to her time playing Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee, on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201dIn her remarks, Louis-Dreyfus, who has supported Democratic candidates and climate-related causes, said that she grew up in the Washington area \u201cin the quaint old rule-of-law period.\u201dIn the crowd Sunday were several Trump administration officials, including Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, and Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, who entered the Kennedy Center with a coterie of security guards.Many of those who spoke talked about Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s kindness, how constant and straightforward it was, even in the middle of a show\u2019s production, or after a triumph.Mary Gross, a fellow cast member on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in the 1980s, said that Louis-Dreyfus would send guests on her shows handwritten thank-you notes, even though \u201cbeing on the show is the prize.\u201dLisa Kudrow, a star of \u201cFriends,\u201d said that after Louis-Dreyfus won the Emmy one year, she sent Ms. Kudrow, a fellow nominee, flowers with a note attached: \u201cYou were robbed. -Julia.\u201dTony Hale, the actor who plays her worried-looking sidekick on \u201cVeep,\u201d said that he was often asked how he felt about the show ending next year.\u201cIt\u2019s a job. I\u2019ll be fine. My identity is not based on this show. That\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cMy identity is based on Julia.\u201dThe chaotic nature of their work, Mr. Hale said, was what allowed Louis-Dreyfus to display her tenderness.\u201cThe main difference with Julia is she consistently handles it with grace and integrity,\u201d he said of the demands of producing television. \u201cJulia knows what matters and makes it a priority above everything else.\u201dEven Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s earliest roles said something about the plight of female comedians in an industry long unfriendly to them.At the end of the ceremony, which will air Nov. 19 on PBS, Louis-Dreyfus revealed that around the time she got the role on \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d she tried out as Portia in a Broadway production of \u201cThe Merchant of Venice\u201d directed by Sir Peter Hall.Not getting the role still haunted her, she said. So on Sunday, she performed several lines from the play, reading them with ironic drama, at one point lurching into the Elaine Benes dance.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "He Almost Couldn\u2019t Walk His Daughter Down the Aisle. What Is Causing His Leaden Feet?", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "Help Dr. Lisa Sanders get to the bottom of unsolved medical mysteries.The 60-year-old man held tight to his daughter\u2019s arm as they waited for their cue to walk down the gravel path of the garden to the altar where the bridegroom waited. As the first notes played, Joe\u2019s daughter gave him a smile and a nod, and they started down the aisle. Joe could hear the crunch of the gravel beneath his feet, but he couldn\u2019t feel it. For the past several months, his feet had felt like numb lumps of clay. In his other hand, he gripped the cane that provided his much-needed stability. He had to concentrate with every step, but he was determined not to embarrass his daughter, or himself, by falling. He\u2019d already fallen once that morning, but luckily only his wife and in-laws had been there.Walking with his daughter on her wedding day had been Joe\u2019s goal for the past few months, and it wasn\u2019t at all clear that he would get here. Certainly, when Joe, a dentist in Fairfield, Conn., first noticed the feeling of pins and needles in his feet, he had no idea that he would be struggling to walk just a year and a half later.Joe already knew he was a very lucky man. Nearly 15 years earlier, he was found to have Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (W.M.), a type of slowly progressive lymphoma that can\u2019t be cured. And based on what he was told, and what he read, he had already outlived most patients with this disease by a good three to four years. When the disease was diagnosed, he had no symptoms. His doctor noticed that his lifelong anemia had worsened and that his red-blood-cell count had dropped even lower than normal. Concerned, the doctor sent off some tests, including a bone-marrow biopsy.The biopsy provided the answer. Most of the room in Joe\u2019s bone marrow \u2014 the place where blood is made \u2014 had been given over to one type of white blood cell, leaving very little room for the cells that made the other blood products, like red cells and platelets. The type of white blood cell filling up the space was what is known as a B lymphocyte, and its job is to produce antibodies. In Joe\u2019s case, a single white blood cell had gone wild, reproducing vigorously, loading his bone marrow with clones, all of them making antibodies, which now crowded into his circulation.Joe went to the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, where one of the world\u2019s experts on W.M. practices, and was treated with the best therapies available at the time. They didn\u2019t work. When his oncologists looked at his bone marrow after treatment, it was worse than when they started. Despite their best efforts, the disease had progressed. Now they turned to an experimental drug called Ibrutinib. The drug was being tested on patients with W.M. as well as several other types of cancers. His response to this new medication was immediate and remarkable \u2014 the kind of response that every patient enrolled in a study of an experimental drug prays for. Within months, his disease was in what\u2019s called V.G.P.R., or very good partial response. Although the disease remained in his bone marrow, the number of antibodies in his circulation dropped, and his red blood cells rose; each is nearly normal in number. The only side effect he has had from the medication was a rash on his upper chest, and so for Joe, the decision to continue to take it was an easy one.Because of the effectiveness of the medication, Joe never had to leave his dental practice. For years, only his assistant even knew he had an illness at all. He had been on Ibrutinib for more than four years when he first noticed the funny pins-and-needles feeling in his left foot and ankle. It started around Christmas. It was no big thing. He only mentioned it in passing when he travelled to the Dana Farber Clinical Institute where he was being treated for his W.M. By summer, that had changed.In June, Joe traveled to Ireland with his wife and in-laws. After they settled into their hotel in Dublin, Joe and his wife, Linda, headed out to see the city, but Joe didn\u2019t get far. For the past few months, he had been feeling that uncomfortable sensation of pins and needles in both feet and ankles, as if they had gone to sleep. He also began to notice a subtle loss of sensation in his feet, and that made walking difficult. He had to watch every step he took; he walked more slowly and tired more quickly. Even his octogenarian in-laws walked faster than he did.At his next appointment, Joe explained how bad his feet and lower legs felt. His hematologist sent him to see a neurologist to get some testing to help identify the cause of the odd sensation. He also sent off blood samples to look for some of the most common causes of what is called a peripheral neuropathy. When the results of those studies were normal, he ordered an M.R.I. of Joe\u2019s brain and spine.One of the first tests done to understand a peripheral neuropathy is a nerve-conduction study, which measures how well nerve fibers are working. The test can determine if it is the nerve fibers themselves that are damaged or if the injury is focused on the fatty sheath surrounding the nerve, known as myelin. Based on the results of the nerve-conduction study and his own exam, the neurologist focused on what he considered the two most likely causes of the man\u2019s neuropathy: the kind of neuropathy sometimes seen with W.M. or a side effect of Ibrutinib, the medication Joe was taking to treat his W.M.The M.R.I. showed bright spots in two places in the spine: one in the neck and a second in the upper chest. These abnormalities raised a third possibility: that Joe\u2019s cancer, while appearing well controlled, had secretly invaded the central nervous system in a rare complication known as Bing-Neel syndrome \u2014 named for the two doctors who first described the devastating, often deadly complication of W.M. nearly 100 years ago. If that\u2019s what Joe had, the cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds his spine and brain, would be dotted with the same lymphocytes that took over his bone marrow.Joe had to stop taking Ibrutinib a few days before he had a lumbar puncture to get the cerebrospinal fluid to look for Bing-Neel. However, before he could restart the medication, Joe suddenly became confused. He developed a fever. He became incontinent. Linda called the doctors in Boston from their home in southern Connecticut. He needed to go to the hospital, they told her.Linda rushed him to Yale New Haven Hospital. He had a thorough evaluation, looking for an infectious cause of his symptoms. When none was found, he was restarted on his chemotherapy and Ibrutinib, and almost immediately he got better. Joe and Linda recalled that something similar happened the last time he stopped the medicine \u2014 that time for a colonoscopy \u2014 but they hadn\u2019t made the connection between the stopped medicine and the strange symptoms, until it happened this second time.While at Yale New Haven Hospital, Joe was seen by a hematologist and a specialist in the neurological effects of cancer known as a neuro-oncologist. After his hospitalization, he continued to see these two doctors to learn if they had any answers to why his feet and legs were now numb and his hands and fingers had that same prickly sensation, as if they\u2019d gone to sleep and never woken up.Something Old? Or Something New?The good news was that there was no evidence that Joe\u2019s cancer had infiltrated his spine or brain. There was no sign that he had Bing-Neel. Some of his spinal fluid was sent to Washington University in St. Louis, and there they found evidence that the advancing neuropathy could be from an autoimmune process in which his immune system was mistakenly attacking his own body. These revved-up, misdirected antibodies could be connected to his cancer, or they could be independent of his cancer. Joe\u2019s brother had an autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis, and the tendency to develop autoimmune diseases can run in families. No matter where the neuropathy was from, the treatment was the same \u2014 suppression of the rogue immune system. He was started on a six-month course of intermittent high-dose steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins, or IVIG.At the end of the six months, Joe\u2019s neuropathy was no better. But it wasn\u2019t any worse either. Joe was grateful for that, because it allowed him to continue to work. And best of all, he was able to walk his daughter down the aisle with the help of his cane. But two months later, after the immune suppression was stopped, the cane wasn\u2019t enough. He needed a walker. When he went back to Dana Farber, his oncologist was worried by the rapid progression of his symptoms. Indeed, he was so worried that he wanted Joe admitted to the hospital to give them a chance to figure out why he was losing his sensation in his legs and now his strength as well.During this hospitalization, the focus shifted from his peripheral nerves \u2014 which send information and instructions to and from the spine and brain \u2014 to the central nervous system. In addition to the areas that lit up in his earlier scan, an M.R.I. done at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital during this admission showed some possible inflammation of the bottom of the spinal cord. The concern was that this was evidence that his W.M. had invaded his central nervous system, even though they had not found evidence of this in the spinal fluid. But his symptoms seemed to be progressing in front of their eyes; by the time he left the hospital, he was using a wheelchair. And so, when he came back to Dana Farber for a follow-up, his doctors recommended that Joe get radiation directed at the bottom of his spine. He had the radiation therapy. It didn\u2019t help. Although it saddened him, Joe let his office know that he would not be returning until he got better.Desperate, Joe and his wife reached out to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. He spent several days there and had dozens and dozens of tests performed. They were unrevealing.A Fight From the BrinkBack in Connecticut, the neurology team at Yale was also concerned by Joe\u2019s continued progression. He was unable to walk at all. He was incontinent of urine and stool. He had almost no sensation below his waist. Earlier studies suggested the presence of antibodies that were attacking the nerves in his legs and lower body. Perhaps if they could take out the fluid containing these antibodies \u2014 the plasma that carries the red blood cells through the body \u2014 and filter out the antibodies, they could stop the destruction. There was no evidence that such an approach, a technique called plasmapheresis, would work in this disease. It hadn\u2019t been studied. But it seemed reasonable that it could work.The neurologists reviewed the very real risks and unclear benefits with Joe and Linda. Given how much Joe had lost, he was ready to try anything. A thick catheter was placed under his skin and into the large vessels that carried blood to the heart. That allowed the circulating plasma in his body to be diverted into a machine that eliminated the antibodies, and then the fluid was reintroduced to his circulation. He had plasmapheresis performed five times.He was to be sent to Gaylord Hospital in Wallingford, Conn., to help get him stronger and see if removing these antibodies had any effect. But before he was even able to leave the hospital, a huge blood clot slammed into Joe\u2019s lungs. His ability to circulate oxygen collapsed. So did his blood pressure. And Joe spent the next two months \u2014 72 days \u2014 in the hospital. He hovered near death for weeks. The only medications he received were those directed at keeping him alive. Even the Ibrutinib, which had kept his W.M. at bay for the past several years, was stopped.Joe fought his way back from the pulmonary embolus and all the subsequent complications. His family had been called in to say their goodbyes twice, but Joe always, somehow, made it through each of these life-threatening complications. He was tough. And lucky. And he survived, despite his doctor\u2019s fears.Diagnosis is a groundbreaking documentary series from The New York Times, Netflix and Dr. Lisa Sanders that harnesses the power of you, our readers, to help find diagnoses for people suffering from mysterious medical conditions. Your ideas could potentially help save a life. Readers with the most promising suggestions may be included in an eight-part Netflix series that will air in 2019.Finally, early this fall, he recovered enough to travel back to Gaylord and begin his recovery. And slowly, with incredibly hard work and toughness of spirit, Joe has gotten stronger. After his long hospital stay, he was too weak to even sit up. He described himself as a salamander \u2014 able only to lie on his back. Even talking was exhausting, at first. Now he can sit up. He can feed himself. He can transfer himself in and out of his chair. He felt lucky to be able to get back to nearly the same level of (dis)ability he had before he got so very sick. But he is still incontinent. He still can\u2019t walk. He is still mostly numb and mostly paralyzed below his waist.But mostly \u2014 that\u2019s new. He had been completely numb and paralyzed. One morning, not too long ago, Joe noticed, almost accidentally, that he could move the toes on one foot. He couldn\u2019t wait to show this to anyone who walked into his room. His wife, his two daughters and everyone who has come to know Joe at Gaylord were excited to see even this tiny bit of progress. Now he can move the toes on both feet.Since leaving the hospital, Joe has also started to feel a burning sensation in his legs and feet. Though not really painful, it\u2019s not a particularly pleasant sensation \u2014 unless you haven\u2019t felt anything at all for nearly a year. To Joe, feeling anything feels like progress. He\u2019s still far, far from being able to even stand. But having any sensation, any ability to move, is new.Why is he getting better? And how much better will he get? None of that is clear. Not to Joe. Not to his doctors. Is it because his W.M. is better? The disease is still there but has progressed very slowly, even though his Ibrutinib was stopped. Or was the neuropathy caused by the Ibrutinib itself? And now that the medication has been stopped, can his body recover? That kind of side effect has not been reported with this medication. Or was it from the plasmapheresis performed months earlier?What do you think is going on here? Is this something you recognize? Do you know these medications, these diseases?

{"Headline": "I'm Just a Middle-Aged House Dad Addicted to Pot", "Date": "2018-10-06", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMr. Pollack is a writer. AUSTIN, Tex. \u2014 My name is Neal, and I\u2019m a marijuana addict.A year ago I wouldn\u2019t have said that, because it would have meant giving up marijuana. I would rather have given up breathing.When I had my first cup of coffee in the morning, I pressed the little button on my vape pen, waited for the blue glow, took a huge inhale and then blew it into the mug so that I could suck in the THC and caffeine at the same time. Then I took another hit, and another. In the afternoons, I\u2019d smoke a bowl, or pop a gummy bear, or both. At night, I got high before eating dinner or watching the ballgame. Maybe I\u2019d stop getting stoned a little bit before bed, but what was the point? If I went to bed high, I could wake up high, too.But I\u2019m not a child with intractable epilepsy, or a veteran with PTSD, or a person who just wants to chill a little, or Willie Nelson. Unless you count writing articles about marijuana, I\u2019m not profiting from the industry. I\u2019m just a middle-aged house dad with a substance-abuse problem.Like most pot addicts in denial, I spent years telling myself that marijuana isn\u2019t addictive, and so I didn\u2019t have a problem. But clearly I did. And I\u2019m not the only one who suffers this way.I started smoking regularly in the \u201990s, when I was in my mid-20s. Pot made everything better \u2014 food, music, sex, cleaning \u2014 and it made nothing worse. I got depressed less often. I laughed all the time.But I also lost my temper for no reason. Did I yell at strangers in public? Probably. I barely remember, because I was stoned. But I do remember that once, high as a promotional blimp, I got into a bar fight with a former friend and broke his tooth with a beer bottle.Back when my writing career was booming, I got invited a couple of times to do readings in Amsterdam, a bad gig for a pot addict. Once, after ingesting a couple of THC pills, I dumped a pitcher of water over my head and insulted the Iraqi representative to National Poetry Day Amsterdam. Another time, I pulled down my pants and flashed a crowd of several hundred. If I had any boundaries, weed erased them thoroughly. The boom ended fast.In 2016, I became the Texas correspondent for a national marijuana newspaper, which gave me lots of excuses to get up to Colorado, America\u2019s new weed utopia. With legalization upon us, I started saying things like: \u201cImagine if you loved coffee but it had been illegal your entire life. That\u2019s what I feel like!\u201d I began to refer to Colorado as \u201cFree America.\u201dIn March of 2017, my mother died. The hour before she passed, I was outside the hospital, getting a shipment of medical gummies from a friend. I was high when I watched her die, I was high at her funeral, and I was high every day for the next eight months. To say I was \u201cself-medicating\u201d to deal with grief would be too kind. My addicted self took grief as a no-limits license to get stoned.In early November, I had the chance to fulfill my lifelong dream of attending a Dodgers World Series game. I spent way too much money on a ticket that turned out to be fake. So high that I couldn\u2019t remember where I\u2019d parked, I started screaming outside the stadium. If I\u2019d been sober, I would have just called the vendor and gotten a refund. That\u2019s what I ended up doing, eventually. But not before security guards surrounded me.I looked into a car mirror and saw an old man, sobbing over a baseball game. That was the moment I accepted that I had a problem. Three weeks later, I quit.I\u2019ve been sober for 11 months.

My daughter is turning 1 this week, so I\u2019m deep in yellow-cake recipes and buttercream, contemplating sprinkles and candles and round cake vs. sheet. (Round is so classic, no?)\u201cI felt like I couldn\u2019t do justice to tofu until I learned to make it this way. It\u2019s custardy on the inside, crisp and lacy on the outside, and just perfectly seasoned throughout.\u201dHere are five dishes for the week:I love this comforting but sophisticated chicken recipe, which is made in one pot, on the stove, and is substantial enough to be a meal with crusty bread or small boiled potatoes alongside.

They never have to know.View this recipe in your weekly plan._____Melissa Clark brilliance, and a pretty fun way to do dinner. Melissa bakes the bacon on a sheet pan, which is objectively the best way to do it. Add rice (make extra to serve with the shakshuka below, if you like) and a can of black beans to round out the meal, and try to follow her suggestion and add a ripe avocado to the taco \u2014 which technically makes it a BLAT taco. Not quite as catchy, but even more delicious.View this recipe in your weekly plan._____This is a smart twist on the North African dish, which can be found throughout the Middle East made with spiced tomatoes and bell pepper. This version swaps out tomatoes for a big bunch of chard, and deletes the spices in favor of jalape\u00f1o and lime. Serve with tortillas, hot sauce and cheese; you could add rice here, too.View this recipe in your weekly plan._____A superb and simple way to do dinner: Sprinkle cod with a mixture of white miso, ginger, garlic, butter and panko bread crumbs, and then bake until that coating caramelizes and crisps. This recipe includes broccoli and brown rice, for a full meal. Miso lasts forever in the fridge, but that won\u2019t be an issue regardless. Once you make fish this way, you\u2019ll do it again and again.

But that expenditure actually fell as a percentage of the overall (and rapidly growing) economy.Corporate tax revenues have fallen by a third from a comparable period a year ago, a direct consequence of the tax law signed last year, which reduced the top corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent.For the full 2018 fiscal year, corporate tax receipts were nearly $205 billion. That figure is a drop from $297 billion in fiscal year 2017.And because the tax law change didn\u2019t take effect until January, its full effect won\u2019t be known until the 2019 fiscal year.At a conference yesterday celebrating Wired magazine\u2019s 25th anniversary, two of the biggest names in tech addressed some of their divisive business strategies:More from Paul Mozur of the NYT:The military exploited Facebook\u2019s wide reach in Myanmar, where it is so broadly used that many of the country\u2019s 18 million internet users confuse the Silicon Valley social media platform with the internet. Human rights groups blame the anti-Rohingya propaganda for inciting murders, rapes and the largest forced human migration in recent history.Facebook has since removed accounts with a total of 1.3 million followers that supposedly focused on entertainment, but that instead appeared tied to the military.This is the latest in a series of disinformation campaigns \u2014 including from Russia and Iran \u2014 to plague Facebook. But as Mr. Mozur points out, it is \u201camong the first examples of an authoritarian government\u2019s using the social network against its own people.\u201dThe Microsoft co-founder, who helped popularize personal computing with Bill Gates and later used his wealth to transform Seattle, died yesterday.

He and Mr. Gates tweaked and massaged the code, and it became the operating system that guided the IBM personal computer, introduced in 1981. That product, called Microsoft Disk Operating System, or MS-DOS, was a watershed for the company.

She was 58.Her husband, Brian Larky, said the cause was cancer.Throughout her film career, Ms. Wells told stories of people whose voices were underrepresented, particularly women, and often developed female characters who were as complex as they were strong.\u201cShe was such an incredible feminist voice \u2014 long before it was fashionable,\u201d said Nina Jacobson, a friend who founded the production company Color Force, which was behind movies like \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d and \u201cThe Hunger Games.\u201d\u201cA woman can feel destroyed by the end of a relationship, feel lost and then go and build a life for herself, which Audrey did,\u201d said Ms. Jacobson, who also noted that \u201cUnder the Tuscan Sun\u201d included a lesbian relationship before such story lines were mainstream.Ms. Wells also contributed to films like \u201cChocolat,\u201d \u201cThe Princess Diaries\u201d and \u201cGeorge of the Jungle,\u201d Ms. Jacobson said.\u201cWhat Audrey\u2019s work was doing was expanding the depth and complexity of the female characters,\u201d Ms. Jacobson said, adding that \u201cshe gave them the opportunity to be as dimensional as white guys get to be all the time.\u201dAudrey Ann Lederer was born in San Francisco on Jan. 25, 1960, and grew up in Sausalito, Calif.

But Ms. Wells was also a working mother who led by example, letting her daughter know when she was on deadline.Ms. Wells met Mr. Larky at a dinner party in 2012.

Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s chairman and chief executive, said at the time.WarnerMedia already licenses its films and shows to other streaming businesses, but it will have to forgo that revenue once it carries that content exclusively for its own service. \u201cFriends,\u201d for example, a WarnerMedia property, is licensed to Netflix in a deal that will run out in a few years.In an interview after his appearance, Mr. Stankey estimated that a quarter of the WarnerMedia library licensed to other streaming services comes up for renewal every year.WarnerMedia already has several streaming products. Its best known is HBO Now, which was introduced in 2015 and now has over five million customers. Last month, WarnerMedia started selling a video subscription service offering feature films and shows based on characters from DC Comics, another Warner property, that is being heavily marketed across studio lots in Hollywood.Mr. Stankey described the new service as a \u201ccollection of boutiques,\u201d with HBO as its \u201canchor tenant.\u201dAs part of the introduction, HBO will sharply ramp up its programming slate, Mr. Stankey said. But HBO itself will remain focused on high-end entertainment and not become a warehouse for all Warner content, as some had feared.Later in that meeting, he said HBO must \u201cbuild that brand so that it\u2019s broad enough to make that happen.\u201dNow, it appears the streaming service would be more akin to a high-end mall, with HBO bringing in new customers.\u201cHBO is a really important brand, a really important property for us,\u201d he said at the conference. \u201cHowever, I don\u2019t think HBO as its own stand-alone brand will meet the needs of the broad scale of audience and customers that we want to address.\u201dThough declining to say how much the coming service would cost, Mr. Stankey said that it would be more than HBO Now, which costs $15 a month. In addition to HBO and some Warner Bros. films, it will most likely include shows from its TV library. It will not include CNN.Notably, AT&T\u2019s service will coincide with a new offering from the Walt Disney Company, which also plans to start a streaming product next year.Disney beat out Comcast in a fierce bidding war for the majority of 21st Century Fox, pushing to win the streaming market by stocking up on valuable content.\u201cDisney doesn\u2019t have a paid premium service like we do with HBO,\u201d Mr. Stankey said. \u201cWe\u2019re also AT&T. We already have tens of millions of direct consumer relationships.\u201dComparing AT&T\u2019s approach to Disney\u2019s, he added, \u201cWhat\u2019s important to understand is that ours is a unified offering \u2014 we\u2019re not expecting people to buy three different pieces.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Marriott Workers Struggle to Pay Bills, and Credit Union Fees", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWorking as a dishwasher at the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown, Amos Troyah made about $30,000 in a recent 12-month period. Roughly $2,000 of it was spent on an especially frequent expense: fees on his checking and savings accounts at the Marriott Employees\u2019 Federal Credit Union.The fees came in increments like $6 and $10 \u2014 minimum-balance fees, excess-transaction fees, automatic money-transfer fees. On occasion, they were joined by that pooh-bah of personal finance charges, the overdraft fee, at a hefty $35.Thousands of Marriott workers around the country are on strike, complaining that stagnant wages and unsteady hours have made it difficult to stay afloat. At a time when they are under particular pressure, the credit union may be adding to their struggles. Other employees said Mr. Troyah\u2019s experience with fees was common.For more affluent Marriott employees, on the other hand, credit union membership can be a very good deal. Typical interest rates on car loans and mortgages obtained through the credit union are below the national average, according to financial filings. And better-paid employees less frequently need services that incur high fees, like overdraft protection.What\u2019s more, while the credit union is officially independent from Marriott, the board that oversees it consists primarily of Marriott managers who may not always be sensitive to the inequities these policies impose.The Marriott workers\u2019 experience is a stark example of trends that are increasingly bearing down on the nearly 100 million people nationwide who have credit union accounts.Credit unions \u2014 not-for-profit institutions that are owned by their depositors and receive a federal tax subsidy \u2014 were long considered a way to democratize banking. They were meant to serve workers who lacked access to the same financial services as middle managers or executives. Many early credit unions were managed by workers from small offices off factory floors. With the money made on loans, often to better-paid workers, they could offer checking and savings accounts at little or no cost.This philosophy largely persisted into the 1990s, even as credit unions grew larger and hired professional managers. \u201cYou had this relationship with people you were serving that you never lost track of,\u201d said Randy Chambers, the president of Self-Help Credit Union in North Carolina, which has merged with a handful of smaller credit unions across the state.Some credit unions still see their mission in such terms. But in recent decades, many have subtly shifted their approach. As falling interest rates made loans less lucrative, credit unions largely turned to fees to help replace the lost income. Over the past quarter-century, the average value of the fees collected for every dollar of interest income has risen to nearly 17 cents, from just under 7 cents.For credit unions harder pressed to fund their operations, that figure can get much higher. The GE Credit Union of Connecticut makes 34 cents in fees for every dollar of interest on loans, according to last year\u2019s regulatory filings. The Montgomery County Employees Federal Credit Union in Maryland makes 44 cents.But even against this backdrop, Marriott is an outlier. It takes in 52 cents in fees for every dollar of interest income.As a result, some Marriott workers find themselves in a kind of financial double jeopardy: Low pay from Marriott keeps their account balances minimal, and those modest balances lead to more fees, crimping their assets further.\u201cThe money gets into my account, and they take it out when I overdraft,\u201d Mr. Troyah said. \u201cThey are robbing me.\u201dOn its own, raising more income through fees is defensible. For example, in a given month, only a minority of accounts typically go into the red. Not charging overdraft fees or minimum-balance fees is, in effect, a decision to ask other members to subsidize that minority.\u201cPeople came around to the idea of it not being all that fair to do it that way,\u201d said Mike Schenk, chief economist at the Credit Union National Association, an industry trade group. \u201cThat you ought to pay for the services you use.\u201dBut the effect in many cases is that the people least able to bear the costs of operating a credit union are gradually paying more of them.Overdraft fees in particular have provoked controversy within the credit union world. \u201cWe have a hard time taking seriously any depository institution claim to trying to serve the underserved, making credit available to financially distressed people and charging those same people $30 to $35 for overdraft,\u201d said Rebecca Born\u00e9, senior policy counsel for the Center for Responsible Lending, which is affiliated with the Self-Help Credit Union.The Marriott credit union, whose membership of about 32,000 includes housekeepers, dishwashers and cooks, would seem to fill that bill. While fees can be an issue for any credit union with financially strapped members, Marriott\u2019s are unusually high: more than 1.7 percent of the credit union\u2019s assets. That is three times the percentage generated by fees at credit unions serving workers at Safeway, Publix and Nordstrom \u2014 broadly similar service-sector employers.Glenn Newton, the credit union\u2019s chief executive, said that looking at such measures can be misleading because the modest wealth of his members leads to low average deposits. That leaves the credit union with less money for generating income. In effect, he said, the credit union must pay the same costs per member as other credit unions, but has fewer ways to offset those costs.He urged adjusting the analysis to account for the small deposits \u2014 say, by considering how much greater its assets would be if its average deposit was more typical of the industry. That would bring the fee ratio in line with other service-sector credit unions.As a practical matter, however, the fees that an average Marriott credit union member pays across all services \u2014 $94 last year \u2014 are far higher than at these other institutions, and higher than at credit unions of a similar size.Jose Ramirez Paredes makes just over $13 an hour cleaning banquet rooms and other public areas at the Baltimore Marriott Waterfront. Mr. Ramirez Paredes said through an interpreter that he helped support his stepson, as well as a daughter and two grandchildren living nearby. He sells Amway products on the side to cover his expenses, which include a mortgage and a car payment that together cost him about $1,000 per month.But even so, he often falls short. The August statement for Mr. Ramirez Paredes\u2019s credit union account shows more than $800 in overdraft fees so far this year. Mr. Newton said that overdraft fees had declined by nearly 10 percent between 2013 and last year, and that he believed such cases were unusual.Workers like Mr. Ramirez Paredes and Mr. Troyah say their financial problems are heightened by Marriott\u2019s decision to rely more on temps and less on full-time employees, who have seen their hours cut back and their annual earnings fall. According to Rachel Gumpert, a spokeswoman for Unite Here, the union that represents the company\u2019s striking workers, a central issue in the dispute is that workers are having to hold down multiple jobs to support themselves because they aren\u2019t receiving enough hours at the hotel chain.Mr. Ramirez Paredes says that even though he is considered a full-time employee, he is frequently assigned to work only three or four days per week, sometimes as little as one day. (If his hours in a six-month period fall too much, he will lose his full-time status.) Mr. Troyah\u2019s W-2 forms show that his income declined from about $34,000 in 2016 to about $28,000 in 2017 because, he says, Marriott cut his hours.Both men said that they had asked their managers why they didn\u2019t receive more hours, and that the managers had told them business was slow. But that claim was at odds with the presence of workers dispatched from staffing firms. Marriott declined to comment.Lekesha Wheelings, who has worked as a line cook at the Philadelphia Marriott Downtown for the past 12 years, says that she makes just over $19 an hour, but that she, too, is sometimes sent home early and ends up with fewer than 40 hours per week.Ms. Wheelings, who lives with her eldest daughter and supports twin 17-year-old children, said she made nearly $45,000 in 2016, but only about $39,500 last year because she worked less.To cope with the strain in her personal finances, Ms. Wheelings has at times resorted to what is known as a mini-loan from the credit union, a six-month loan of up to $500 with an 18 percent interest rate \u2014 generally the legal limit for federal credit unions \u2014 and a $35 application fee. Including the fee, the effective annual interest rate on such a loan is about 40 to 50 percent.But even more reasonably priced short-term loans can hurt those with the most precarious finances, making them more likely to run up fees on the checking side. \u201cIf someone can\u2019t afford more debt, the expectation is that it would increase their overall financial burden and lead to more overdraft fees,\u201d Ms. Born\u00e9 said of the mini-loans.During the months in which she was repaying a mini-loan beginning in late 2014, the Marriott credit union deducted at least $450 in overdraft fees from Ms. Wheelings\u2019s checking account, according to her statements. The loan repayment left less money for such expenses as an $8.47 Netflix subscription and a $17 membership in a legal assistance service, but the overdraft protection allowed them to glide through each month, at a steep markup.Ms. Wheelings says she plans to keep using the credit union but would like to pay fewer fees. Mr. Ramirez Paredes, alarmed by the fees, says he plans to close his account.By contrast, more affluent workers, including some executives at Marriott, appear to benefit at little cost from the credit union, securing favorable interest rates on car loans and mortgages while largely avoiding heavy fees.Public records show that several current and former executives have obtained large mortgages from the credit union. They include Don Cleary, the Canada president for Marriott International, who received a $1 million mortgage in December 2016; William McGowan, a longtime design and project manager ($875,000 in December 2014); Michael Rhoads, senior director of international accounting ($825,000 in November 2016); and Norman Jenkins, a former senior vice president ($765,000 in February 2017).\u201cThe proper comparison isn\u2019t whether or not an hourly associate has access to the same loans or interest rates as a company executive,\u201d said Mr. Newton, the chief executive. \u201cRather, it\u2019s whether the credit union offers value to the members, based on their individual credit profile, versus what they could have received at other financial institutions.\u201dMr. Newton said the loans the credit union does offer to low-paid workers, like the mini-loan, are a more affordable option than products they could obtain elsewhere, such as payday loans.Credit unions are legally separate from the companies whose employees they serve. But there is often significant overlap between managers of the two organizations.At the Marriott credit union, five board members are Marriott employees with \u201cvice president\u201d in their title; three are employees with \u201cdirector\u201d in their title. The only \u201con property\u201d employee on the board is the general manager of the Bethesda Suites Marriott in Maryland.While any member can run for a seat on a credit union\u2019s board, many boards are stacked with company executives and those with financial expertise to oversee their increasingly sophisticated operations.Some credit unions take steps to make sure they remain sensitive to the needs of members. The State Employees\u2019 Credit Union in North Carolina maintains a local advisory council composed of workers at each of its more than 250 branches, in addition to its board. The local bodies meet with managers four times a year and are apt to give them an earful if they encounter fees or lending policies that workers regard as unfair. That approach is relatively uncommon in the industry, though Mr. Newton said the Marriott credit union had periodically sought feedback from members in surveys.\u201cMembers should elect the board to look after their own interests, and one of those should be balancing who pays for what,\u201d said Jim Blaine, who ran the State Employees\u2019 Credit Union for decades before retiring in 2016. But in practice, he added, \u201cyou can have a board of senior managers who truly don\u2019t understand that 75 percent of people live paycheck to paycheck.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "In Japan, the Kit Kat Isn\u2019t Just a Chocolate. It\u2019s an Obsession.", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times. She has won two James Beard Foundation awards for restaurant criticism.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s.

Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit.

Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTrade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.For millions of Latin Americans, the Colombina factory in La Paila is the place where sweet moments are made.Leer en enspa\u00f1olFor nearly 50 years, Bon Bon Bums have been produced in the Colombina factory in La Paila, north of Cali. At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "Making Sense of the Selling in the Stock Market", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported bySome stock declines are more foreboding than others.The selling that has driven down the markets continued on Friday. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index is down 9 percent from its peak in September, and on pace for its worst month since the 2008 financial crisis. Swoons like this one can be unnerving, in part because they suggest all is not well with the broader economy.But some of the selling may not augur much.Take technology stocks, whose recent declines have played a big role in dragging down the overall market. Shares of big tech companies have soared this year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up more than 17 percent at its peak this year and 55 percent since Donald J. Trump was elected president.That left tech stocks vulnerable to a sharp sell-off.That\u2019s why the declines in shares of companies like Netflix and Amazon this month say more about their stock market valuations than the state of the wider economy.Earlier this year, Netflix was trading at 110 times the earnings Wall Street analysts expected the company to make over the next 12 months, according to FactSet. That multiple is many times that of the wider market and suggests that investors were confident Netflix would deliver on its ambitious goals. But big questions, including its ability to finance its growth and rising competition, hang over the company. The drop in Netflix\u2019s stock is thus evidence of healthy skepticism, rather than kneejerk bearishness about its future.But other selling cannot be so easily shrugged off.Bank stocks are down a lot this year. That\u2019s despite a strong economy, which typically leads to increased lending activity; rising interest rates, which have bolstered the profitability of banks\u2019 core lending business; the tax cuts enacted last year, which had an outsize effect on bank profits; and hopes for deregulation. Yet the shares of Citigroup, the nation\u2019s third largest bank, are down nearly 20 percent from their high earlier this year. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo are all down about 15 percent this year.If bank stocks are a barometer for the economy, their poor performance points to some of the questions that keep investors up at night. Will President Trump\u2019s trade war soon start to do real damage to corporate earnings and the global economy? Will the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate increases crimp economic activity by depriving companies and households of the loans they need to finance purchases?A rout helps investors decide what\u2019s worth really worrying about.

{"Headline": "Adam Sandler\u2019s Netflix Special: His Most Satisfying Comedy in Years", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyAt a microphone, he starts singing about how his grandmother just died. A few commuters stop to listen. He leans into the song, asking with conviction how he will tell his kids before dancing his way to the punch line: \u201cI guess I\u2019ll go to a bingo game and steal somebody else\u2019s grandma, and hope that my dumb kids can\u2019t tell the difference.\u201dThe camera focuses on a few people who are distinctly unimpressed. No one puts a coin in the empty guitar case. Sandler holds back a chuckle.How in the world did Adam Sandler become one of the most famous comedians alive? This scene, where, stripped of his celebrity, he bombs in front of strangers, both asks and answers the question, since he comes off as deeply ordinary but also more than willing to present himself as such. Many comics would not have included it, but there\u2019s always been a vulnerability to Sandler\u2019s frustrated Everyman charisma. As this eternally boyish comic has moved into his 50s, this aspect of his appeal has come to the fore.As he has become a middle-aged movie star, his perspective has shifted. It\u2019s certainly unlikely that in his 20s he would have begun a joke, as he does here, by asking, \u201cDo you ever have a friend who rescues too many animals?\u201dAnd yet, this special has all the hallmarks of his herky-jerky comedy: a loopy, lewd sense of humor that often spins into the absurd; muffled anger that periodically explodes into comic violence; and the kind of delirious physical and vocal silliness that makes him the modern inheritor of the legacy of Jerry Lewis. But what makes this his most satisfying work since \u201cPunch Drunk Love\u201d (2002), directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, who filmed some of his stand-up in Los Angeles (Steven Brill directed the special), is how fully it embraces a signature of his late career: an unapologetic sentimentality.What distinguishes Sandler from other aging star comedians is his gift for schmaltz. Billy Crystal can overdo it, while Jerry Seinfeld, for all his hard-working showmanship, still can\u2019t quite go there, remaining a chilly observer instead of an introspective participant.But lately Sandler has had a knack for finding the pitch-perfect emotionalism to make a memorable comic moment. Music, the most nakedly emotional of art forms, helps.In his special, Sandler does not close with his funniest joke but rather \u2014 after a dismal bit about astronaut sex that evokes some of his most indulgent cinematic duds \u2014 with two deeply emotional songs, the first a tribute to Chris Farley that runs through his career, describes in detail discussions about his addiction and death, and concludes on a note about how his comedy lives on. Then Sandler moves on to a song about his love for his wife that segues into a tribute to his relationship with the audience, as a nostalgic montage of Sandler plays, showing him as a kid, then a teenager and, finally, a movie star. Then he ends with his daughters telling dirty jokes.How these personal bits work for you will vary. As someone who grew up watching Sandler on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d \u2014 when he was joking about crank calls, I was making them \u2014 and now is, like him, a father with two daughters, I am perhaps more susceptible than most.But make no mistake: laughs followed by tears \u2014 even cheap ones \u2014 make a potent combination. And Sandler is working on the most universal of subjects: nostalgia and the importance of family. Many of his bits are elaborate attempts to hold on to his old obscene jokiness while playing the patriarch.When he tells a story about his sixth-grade daughter asking what it means when boys say, \u201cThat\u2019s what she said,\u201d Sandler makes a show of trying to figure out how to explain this cleanly, without cursing, and as he dramatizes his struggle, his daughter throws a lifeline, saying: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Daddy, you tried your best.\u201d To which, Sandler adds, \u201cAnd I was like, that\u2019s what she said.\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "This New York Film Festival Is Definitely Not Boring", "Date": "2018-10-03", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookBetween now and Oct. 14, when the 56th New York Film Festival ends, you can see some of the best \u2014 as well as some of the most inspiring, confounding and maddening \u2014 movies of the year. A diverse sampler of the popular and the abstruse, the festival may be middle-aged, but it remains surprising, if at times reliably exasperating. Its selections are eclectic, unapologetically and rightly elitist, and occasionally predictable. (Bonjour, Olivier Assayas.) Presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center, it has carved out a distinct niche in the festival-crowded fall, partly because, unlike similar events, it isn\u2019t chasing Oscar contenders.Other highlights from the festival\u2019s second half include Pawel Pawlikowski\u2019s \u201cCold War,\u201d which tracks two lovers, a pianist and a singer (the erotically charged duo Tomasz Kot and Joanna Kulig), across several decades and countries, beginning in Poland in the wake of World War II. In May at Cannes, when \u201cCold War\u201d first screened, a few critics I know lodged a rare festival complaint, saying the movie\u2019s roughly 90-minute running time was too short. But Mr. Pawlikowski compresses entire worlds into this exquisite black-and-white drama, which movingly sets love, art and self-determination against tyranny.The festival has scooped off some additional cream from this year\u2019s Cannes, including movies as diverse as Jafar Panahi\u2019s \u201c3 Faces,\u201d Hirokazu Kore-eda\u2019s \u201cShoplifters,\u201d Alice Rohrwacher\u2019s \u201cHappy as Lazzaro\u201d and Jia Zhangke\u2019s \u201cAsh Is Purest White.\u201d Tickets were still available for some of these titles. But even if a screening is designated as standby, you may want to head over to Lincoln Center and try your luck. The festival releases tickets daily, announcing availability through its newsletter, and it often gets people off the standby line and into theaters because of no-shows.It may seem counterintuitive to pay more to see a movie in a festival, especially if it\u2019s scheduled to open soon. But seeing new releases before they have been repeatedly fed through the critical meat grinder can be deeply satisfying; good, bright projection on decent-size screens is another festival dividend. In some cases, a movie also demands to be seen more than once, which is invariably the case with the work of Jean-Luc Godard. His latest, \u201cThe Image Book,\u201d is a dense visual and aural collage that I\u2019ve seen twice and expect to see several times more, even if Mr. Godard seems to be picking a fight with the viewer.Over time, as he has developed and refined his own cinematic language, he has seemed increasingly indifferent to his audience. That has regularly been held against him, which says more about the state of corporate-dominated popular culture than him; complexity, difficulty, experimentation and opacity aren\u2019t failings. And while even loyalists may find \u201cThe Image Book\u201d sometimes rough going, it is a fascinating object, partly because Mr. Godard, now 87, seems to be sifting through a lifetime of images and ideas (on war and more war) amid shocks of beauty and horror.Another standout is Christian Petzold\u2019s moody, beguiling, formally bold \u201cTransit,\u201d about a German refugee (an excellent Franz Rogowski) who\u2019s trying to flee to North America from Nazi-occupied France. Set in a past that looks just like the present \u2014 everything is contemporary, clothing included \u2014 the story turns history into an existential maze from which few seem destined to escape. Also recommended are the latest from Hong Sang-soo: \u201cGrass\u201d and the quietly elegiac \u201cHotel by the River.\u201d It isn\u2019t entirely clear what \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs,\u201d the new Joel and Ethan Coen movie, is doing squeezed into the main slate, but it is a lot of fun to watch, until it isn\u2019t.As is true of any festival, this one has some head-scratchers, including \u201cAsako I & II,\u201d a bland drama about a young woman, a cipher as droopy as the movie, whose heart breaks when her lover walks out. Years later, she falls for a second guy who looks just like the first and is played by the same actor with a shorter haircut. Equally unconvincing is \u201cRay & Liz,\u201d a stale slice of British miserablism in which every buzzing insect and human agony is lovingly lit and photographed.There are 30 movies in the main slate, and while these titles eat up most of the media attention, it\u2019s worth remembering that the festival has a great deal more to offer. There are 148 movies in this edition, including in programs dedicated to experimental work and documentaries. There are also some free events, like separate talks featuring Mr. Dafoe, Mr. Cuar\u00f3n and Ms. Rohrwacher. A number of scholars will be present for a panel on restoration and the film pioneer Alice Guy Blach\u00e9, who\u2019s the subject of a recent documentary from Pamela Green.Ms. Green\u2019s \u201cBe Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy Blach\u00e9,\u201d in the retrospective program, tracks the life, career and rediscovery of the world\u2019s first female director. It will be accompanied by a screening of Guy Blach\u00e9\u2019s 1912 film \u201cFalling Leaves,\u201d which in 12 eventful minutes tells the touching story of a young girl, Little Trixie, who attempts to keep her older, tubercular sister alive. Directed by Guy Blach\u00e9, who had her own production company, Solax, the film is fascinatingly perched between theater and cinema, and \u2014 like Ms. Green\u2019s documentary \u2014 a reminder of when female directors freely charted their own destinies.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Justice Department Sues to Stop California Net Neutrality Law", "Date": "2018-09-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON \u2014 The Justice Department on Sunday sued California to stop the state\u2019s new law that would guarantee full and equal access to the internet, a principle known as net neutrality, in the latest legal fight between the state and the Trump administration.The suit was filed shortly after Gov. Jerry Brown signed the net neutrality bill. The law is one of the strongest efforts in the nation to restore internet access rules since they were rolled back by the Federal Communications Commission last year. Governor Brown, a Democrat, has been a forceful opponent of many of the president\u2019s actions, including on immigration and environmental deregulation.Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that California\u2019s net neutrality law was illegal because Congress granted the federal government, through the F.C.C., the sole authority to create rules for broadband internet providers.\u201cStates do not regulate interstate commerce \u2014 the federal government does,\u201d Mr. Sessions said in a statement. \u201cOnce again the California legislature has enacted an extreme and illegal state law attempting to frustrate federal policy.\u201dXavier Becerra, California\u2019s attorney general, said the state would defend its new law.California \u201cwill not allow a handful of power brokers to dictate sources for information or the speed at which websites load,\u201d Mr. Becerra said. \u201cWe remain deeply committed to protecting freedom of expression, innovation and fairness.\u201dThe Justice Department suit was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California.The debate over net neutrality has created a crowded legal battlefield. Mr. Becerra is also among 20 state attorneys general filing suit against the federal rollback of rules. Many broadband providers are expected to sue states that enact new rules, including California.California\u2019s net neutrality law prohibits telecommunications companies like AT&T and Comcast from blocking or slowing down the delivery of internet traffic to broadband customers. The law goes further than the rules that the Trump administration eliminated, by also prohibiting promotions known as zero rating, that give unlimited streaming of certain sites for free but charge for others.The law is meant to protect consumers from attempts by telecom companies to charge extra or suppress access for some websites. The legislation is also intended to protect start-ups that could not compete with bigger websites that team with telecom companies for greater exposure to internet users.State Senator Scott Wiener, an author of the state bill, defended the law after the Justice Department lawsuit was announced.\u201cIn their world, no one is allowed to protect an open internet,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been down this road before: when Trump and Sessions sued California and claimed we lacked the power to protect immigrants. California fought Trump and Sessions on their immigration lawsuit \u2014 California won \u2014 and California will fight this lawsuit as well.\u201dThe F.C.C. passed net neutrality rules in 2015 with the support of President Barack Obama. But the F.C.C. chairman under President Trump, Ajit Pai, has argued that the rules aren\u2019t needed, saying that there aren\u2019t enough examples of harm to justify rules on broadband providers. Some promotions, like zero rating, in which a company like Verizon may offer free streaming of Hulu but not Netflix, could be good for consumers, he said.\u201cThe internet is free and open today, and it will continue to be under the light-touch protections,\u201d Mr. Pai said in a statement supporting the Justice Department lawsuit.Since the F.C.C. dismantled federal net neutrality rules last December, four states, including California, passed their own net neutrality laws. The F.C.C. has argued that the states are not allowed to create new rules. But state legislators and consumer groups have said they are prepared to fight any lawsuits.\u201cWhen the F.C.C. chose to ignore the millions of consumers who urged them not to repeal net neutrality protections last year, it left a void that state lawmakers are now rightly filling,\u201d said Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for Consumers Union.Mr. Schwantes said the California law was particularly significant. \u201cThanks to its market power and influence as the country\u2019s largest state,\u201d he said, \u201cCalifornia\u2019s law sends a strong message to internet service providers and has the potential to shape the market across the country.\u201dThe California law was expected to set off lawsuits by telecom companies, which say strict rules would increase their costs. They argue that state laws create a difficult regulatory patchwork across the nation.Those suits could still arrive, even with the Justice Department\u2019s action.USTelecom, a trade group representing big broadband providers such as Verizon and Charter, criticized the rules for creating separate rules for California and other states. The group did not reply to questions on immediate plans for a lawsuit but several industry officials say the state rules are likely to be challenged.\u201cRather than 50 states stepping in with their own conflicting open internet solutions, we need Congress to step up with a national framework for the whole internet ecosystem and resolve this issue once and for all,\u201d Jonathan Spalter, the president of USTelecom, said in a statement.Katie Benner contributed reporting.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "She\u2019s Suffering from Life-Threatening Anemia. Can You Help?", "Date": "2018-10-01", "News": "Help Dr. Lisa Sanders get to the bottom of unsolved medical mysteries.It scared her. Not the blood transfusion \u2014 she had dozens of them over these past 18 years. She was scared by the degree of impairment she must have had while driving here. When her blood count got really low, she couldn\u2019t think straight; she knew this about herself. And yet she had driven the 12 miles from her home in suburban Austin to this hospital in a condition she now knew was unsafe. She had been behind the wheel when she was severely impaired. Not by drugs or alcohol, but by a brain starved of sufficient blood. Sherry knew she would have been angry if her children had driven in a similar state. She felt embarrassed and ashamed of her own recklessness.She watched the second unit of blood ease into her system. She felt like every drop helped her feel just a little stronger, think just a little more clearly. When the transfusion was done, she was eager to go. They checked her blood to make certain it was at a safe level and, when reassured, discharged her.When she got home, she told her husband and teenage children what had happened. \u201cNever let me do that again,\u201d she begged them. If they saw her with the car keys in her hands, they needed to talk to her to make sure she was making sense. If she wasn\u2019t able to carry on a conversation, she was sure she shouldn\u2019t be allowed to drive. Why didn\u2019t you ask for a ride? her older daughter asked. We were all here. Sherry felt her face redden. I guess I was too impaired to know how impaired I was, she confessed.Sherry had been anemic for most of her life. When she was very young, her mother told her, her doctor had put her on iron drops. In middle school, another doctor had put her on iron pills. And she took them \u2014 even though they made her constipated and hurt her stomach. When she was in her 20s, she was again put on iron pills. But through all this, she felt fine. She finished high school, started college, finished nursing school and married. She had two kids. Sure, she was tired some of the time. But not, she thought, more tired than other women who had husbands, careers and kids.But then in 2001, when she was pregnant with her third child, Sherry\u2019s OB got worried. She was, he told her, very anemic. Pregnant woman often have blood levels that look anemic but aren\u2019t. That\u2019s because blood counts are determined by the number of red blood cells per amount of fluid in our arteries. And in pregnancy, there\u2019s a lot more fluid in the circulation, and so the blood is more dilute. A normal blood level, or hemoglobin, for a woman is 12 grams of red blood cells per each liter of fluid. For pregnant women, the \u201cnormal\u201d level drops to between 10 and 11. Sherry\u2019s hemoglobin level, she was told, was less than 8. Because blood is essential for fetal growth and development, the obstetrician insisted that Sherry have a transfusion \u2014 her first. That one infusion of red blood cells got Sherry through her pregnancy, but it seemed that after that she was constantly anemic. She took iron pills three times a day for as many days as she could manage. But even with that, her hemoglobin level was usually between 9 and 10 and her iron was often barely detectable.\u2193For the next several years, Sherry worked hard to keep taking her iron, but every year she seemed to be losing ground. No matter how much iron she took, she could feel herself getting more and more tired. She started to crave ice \u2014 a strange but common symptom in those who don\u2019t have enough iron to make the blood they need. And despite her best efforts, when her iron levels were measured, they were always low.Her gynecologist thought it was the heavy menstrual flow she developed after the birth of her last baby and recommended a procedure to permanently remove the lining of the uterus that causes the monthly bleed. She had that done and it stopped her bleeding, but it didn\u2019t keep her from being anemic.\u2193Her doctor then suggested that she try getting her iron supplements intravenously rather than taking it as a pill. After the first treatment, Sherry felt energetic. Her fatigue disappeared. She felt great. But it didn\u2019t last. Whenever she found herself carrying around cups of ice again, she would call her doctor. Her blood counts continued to measure low, sometimes dangerously so. She started seeing a blood specialist, a hematologist, who put her on a monthly dose of intravenous iron.Her hematologist noted that sometimes Sherry\u2019s blood count would drop suddenly. One report showed Sherry\u2019s count drop from 7.1 to 6.4 overnight. There aren\u2019t many medical problems that could cause such a drop. A significant episode of bleeding might do that. But Sherry said she hadn\u2019t noticed any blood loss. She did notice an episode of dark urine over the weekend while camping with her family. Her hematologist suspected that maybe her last transfusion had caused a reaction leading her immune system to destroy the new blood. That kind of destruction could cause a loss of blood and its constituent iron as the recycling systems would be flooded and overwhelmed. He looked for evidence of red blood cell destruction. He didn\u2019t find it.Still, what else could cause her blood counts to drop this way? He started her on high-dose steroids. If her anemia were caused by her own immune system, the steroids, which suppress that system, would help. Remarkably, her blood counts stabilized almost immediately. She had required six units of blood early in the month to get her hemoglobin above 7. Two weeks after starting the steroids, her blood counts remained high \u2014 for her. And they stayed that way for several months. To Sherry\u2019s hematologist, this suggested that her anemia was caused by her immune system interfering with either some process in the way blood was made or possibly destroying the blood itself. He couldn\u2019t find direct evidence of either, but the fact that the steroids helped supported his hypothesis.Steroid medications, like prednisone or dexamethasone \u2014 which is what this patient was on \u2014 are powerful immune-suppressing medications. They can also cause terrible side effects. Infections are more common because these drugs are so effective at suppressing the system dedicated to fighting them off. Steroids can also damage the tough lining of the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. They can damage joints. They make healing more difficult. And they made Sherry\u2019s stomach hurt. Because of all these potential harms, the hematologist wanted to find a medication to replace the dexamethasone. He tried infusing antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins) from other people\u2019s systems \u2014 a drug called IVIG, short for intravenous immunoglobulins. That seemed to work, but whenever he tried to reduce or eliminate the dexamethasone, her blood count and iron level would plummet. You can see some of the early notes from the hematologist below.When her hematologist left the practice, she switched to his partner. He tried adding a different, less dangerous immune-suppressing medication called Rituxan. But again, when he tried to get rid of the dexamethasone, or even just lower the dose, her need for blood and iron would lurch upward. How could she get the benefits of the steroids without the risk? He adjusted the doses \u2014 could he increase the IVIG and rituximab and just keep her on a very low dose of dexamethasone? These frequent transfusions \u2014 nearly one a month \u2014 and biweekly infusions of iron carried their own risks. When the Rituxan didn\u2019t help, the decision was made to remove Sherry\u2019s spleen. Removing this organ, basically a very large lymph node, has been shown to be helpful in treating autoimmune disorders of the blood. The thinking is that the spleen traps the red blood cells that have been targeted by the rogue antibodies. Once trapped there, the red blood cells are destroyed. Although no one had ever found any evidence that Sherry had an autoimmune disorder, it was the most likely cause of her chronic anemia. The splenectomy was a bigger operation than expected, but once Sherry recovered, the frequency of her blood transfusions dropped from twice a month to once a month and then to twice a year or less. To see the note about splenectomy, see below.\u2193After two and a half years of high-dose steroids, Sherry\u2019s body gave the signal that she\u2019d had enough. She developed an ulcer in her stomach, which, over time, ate its way through the full thickness of the muscle, causing a rupture. Her stomach\u2019s contents and all its acid were splattered throughout her abdomen. She was on vacation with her family in New Orleans. They\u2019d been walking around the beautiful old city all morning and her kids wanted to go to the zoo. She had been having trouble with her back for most of the holiday and said she\u2019d go back to the hotel and rest while her husband took them to see the animals. When they got back they found her pale, sweaty and doubled over in pain. She initially diagnosed herself with a kidney stone but when the pain worsened, she allowed her son to call 911. An ambulance rushed her to the hospital, where the perforation was closed. She required several more surgeries that year to fully repair the damage done.Diagnosis is a groundbreaking documentary series from The New York Times, Netflix and Dr. Lisa Sanders that harnesses the power of you, our readers, to help find diagnoses for people suffering from mysterious medical conditions. Your ideas could potentially help save a life. Readers with the most promising suggestions may be included in an eight-part Netflix series that will air in 2019.For the past several years, Sherry\u2019s doctors have been trying to manage her anemia with IVIG alone. Because iron can build up in the body, causing organ damage, the doctors have been relying more on blood transfusion. They follow her blood counts and iron levels closely and replete only when necessary. As it has throughout her life, Sherry\u2019s disease seems to wax and wane. She needed only occasional blood or iron from 2013 until 2016. In 2017, she got blood about every other month and iron only three times. This year it has been about the same.\u2193Throughout all this, her doctors have been searching for a cause of Sherry\u2019s persistent iron deficiency anemia. She has been tested for evidence of red blood cell destruction, or hemolysis. None has been found. They continue to suspect an autoimmune process, though again, none of the tests have shown any signs of an immune system gone wild. She has been tested for a rare disorder called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria \u2014 an acquired abnormality in the red blood cell itself that causes the (normal) immune system to mistake the cells for invaders and try to destroy them. Only a minority of patients with this disease have the characteristic red urine seen first thing in the morning that gave the disease its name. She has had five colonoscopies and several upper endoscopies to look, unsuccessfully, for a loss of blood there. Three bone-marrow biopsies have shown good production of red blood cells. Results from a few of these study results can be seen here along with her hematologist\u2019s most recent note.She has seen several of the doctors in a large practice specializing in disorders of the blood. A couple of them have wondered if she causes the drops in her blood counts intentionally. One doctor, Sherry tells me, even asked his nurses to examine her body for signs that she was bleeding herself. They didn\u2019t find anything. The past few years, Sherry has been distracted from her anemia by the many surgeries she has needed on her large joints, probably because of her years on steroids. She has had both hips replaced. And both shoulders were replaced. Twice. But to the extent she can, she tries not to let any of this slow her down. She did have to retire from nursing. It broke her heart, she told me. But she worried that the clarity of her thinking was unpredictable, and she couldn\u2019t expose those children to the risk that she would miss something because her blood levels were low.Now she just tries to take care of her teenage children. And a patient husband. And, of course, her own body, when she has to.Have you seen anything like this? Do you know what Sherry has, and why she continues to need blood transfusions? If so, please let us know. Your suggestions will be shared with the patient, who will share them with her doctor. Help us find an answer for Sherry.

{"Headline": "Tech Drove Stocks Skyward. It Was a Different Story on the Way Down.", "Date": "2018-10-31", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byLarge technology companies, and the big profits they produce, lifted the markets earlier this year. But during October\u2019s tumble they were only part of a broad-based downturn. The world\u2019s largest technology companies drove the stock market to record highs earlier this year. As stocks have tumbled, though, it\u2019s more like they\u2019re just along for the ride.Unlike the rally, the rout that started in late September and dominated trading in October was a broad-based affair. That suggests that investors are less concerned that the tech giants\u2019 shares rose too far too fast, and are instead worried about the fundamentals of the United States economy and the continuing profitability of companies of all kinds.October was particularly painful for investors. At its worst, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index was down more than 9 percent during the month. A late charge took some of the sharp edge off: The S.&P. 500 was up around 1 percent on Wednesday, its second straight gain, helping to cut losses for the month to around 7 percent. \u201cI think there\u2019s something that\u2019s bothering the markets and I think it\u2019s fears about earnings estimates,\u201d said Randy Watts, chief investment strategist with the investment advisory firm William O\u2019Neil & Company. And only about 20 percent of the slump can be tied to the tech giants, compared with the 50 percent of the gain they were responsible for earlier in the year. There are plenty of factors worrying investors: President Trump\u2019s trade war with China; the Federal Reserve\u2019s stated plans to keep raising interest rates; signs that labor and other costs could climb; and slowing growth in Europe and China. And the tax cuts that increased growth in profits this year will not have the same year-over-year effect in 2019.\u201cDespite the fact that earnings are exceptional by any objective measure, investors are concerned that they will slow more dramatically than expected next year,\u201d said Jason DeSena Trennert, managing partner at Strategas Research Partners, a markets and economic analysis firm. The tech companies\u2019 declines are not minor, but they are not big enough to signal that investors are overly concerned about the health of the stocks that fueled so much of the gains of the past decade.

Representation on TV Improves, Glaad Finds", "Date": "2018-10-25", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe annual study, released Thursday, looked at original scripted prime-time programs across cable networks, broadcast television and streaming.It found that 8.8 percent of series regulars on broadcast television in the 2018-19 season are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer characters, a record high since Glaad\u2019s reporting expanded to count all broadcast series regulars 14 years ago. It is also a significant increase from 6.4 percent last year. Men and women are equally represented among those characters, whereas men made up 55 percent of the characters last year.The report also found that, for the first time, L.G.B.T.Q. characters currently include more people of color (50 percent) than white people (49 percent). Strides have been made in the number of bisexual, transgender and H.I.V.-positive characters as well.\u201cNot only do stories that explore the rich lives and identities of L.G.B.T.Q. people move the needle forward culturally, but they pay off in ratings,\u201d said Sarah Kate Ellis, the president and chief executive of Glaad. \u201cShows like \u2018Will & Grace,\u2019 \u2018Supergirl,\u2019 \u2018Empire\u2019 and \u2018How to Get Away With Murder\u2019 all attract millions of viewers weekly and demonstrate that audiences are hungry for new stories and perspectives.\u201dBroadcast television can (sort of) pat itself on the back for improvements in terms of race: The percentage of black characters has risen to 22 percent from 18 percent since the previous year, while the percentage of Asian-Pacific Islander characters climbed to 8 percent from 7 percent. The amount of Latino characters has remained steady at 8 percent.The most improvement can be seen on streaming services. The total number of L.G.B.T.Q. characters on Amazon, Netflix and Hulu has more than doubled, growing to 112 from 65. Of the three platforms, Netflix is home to the most of these characters.Though people with disabilities remain tremendously underrepresented, the percentage of characters has inched to 2.1 percent from 1.8 percent.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "These Are the World\u2019s Best Candies. Want to Fight About It?", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team.

It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day.

In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTrade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market.

Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper.

Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times.

At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco.

{"Headline": "The Week\u2019s 5 Best and Worst Trailers (Sorry, \u2018Pet Sematary\u2019)", "Date": "2018-10-12", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byThe most exciting trailer released this week wasn\u2019t for a movie. It was a teaser for the much-anticipated, post-Kevin Spacey farewell season of Netflix\u2019s \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d Still, there were several promotional clips for films that also generated discussion online, both positive and negative. Here are the highest-profile, ranked from most to least enticing.A president proclaims to supporters that enemies of the people \u201care trying to strip me of my constitutional power as your commander in chief.\u201d A woman vows, \u201cI\u2019m not going to be told what to do anymore,\u201d not by \u201cany man ever again.\u201d The riveting final-season trailer for Netflix\u2019s political melodrama doesn\u2019t look ripped from the headlines; it looks like it is the headlines. Mr. Spacey was written out of the show after he was accused of multiple instances of sexual misconduct \u2014 he apologized for one incident but hasn\u2019t responded to the others \u2014 and he is nowhere to be seen as the now-deceased President Frank Underwood. Yet his shadow hangs over his widow and White House successor, Claire (Robin Wright), who declares, \u201cThe first female president of the United States is not going to keep her mouth shut.\u201d I wonder what the intriguing new antagonists played by Greg Kinnear and Diane Lane will have to say about that.At first glance, the trailer for this fact-based drama looks like a derivative cross between \u201cHidden Figures\u201d and \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.\u201d As in \u201cFigures,\u201d Taraji P. Henson plays a civil rights pioneer \u2014 in this case, Ann Atwater, who fought to desegregate schools in Durham County, N.C., in 1971. And after winning an Oscar for his performance as a prejudiced cop in \u201cBillboards,\u201d Sam Rockwell is cast as another racist: C.P. Ellis, a Ku Klux Klan leader who ultimately worked alongside Ms. Atwater on integration. The dialogue hardly seems subtle. \u201cI\u2019m the president of the Klan,\u201d Mr. Rockwell\u2019s character states. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to hate black folks.\u201d One can only hope these two gifted actors can bring this material more shades of gray than these snippets display.\u201cSometimes dead is better,\u201d reads the tagline for this remake of the Stephen King chiller, which was previously made into a 1989 film. And sometimes \u2014 like animal bodies in a cursed graveyard \u2014 it\u2019s better to leave things be. The first trailer doesn\u2019t bring anything new to the story, as a doctor (Jason Clarke) moves from Boston to a small Maine town with his wife (Amy Seimetz), befriends a local eccentric (John Lithgow), and discovers a spooky burial ground that brings dead critters back to life. Unlike last year\u2019s revitalized remake of Mr. King\u2019s killer-clown classic, the new \u201cPet Sematary\u201d lacks that certain \u201cIt\u201d factor.Advertisement"}

Dr. Oxman likes to play Noah with would-be applicants. \u201cYou have to have two of everything, so they can procreate intellectually if not biologically,\u201d she said. (There have been material ecology love affairs, five marriages and three babies.) The team has been collaborating, as they say, with natural organisms like slime molds, monarchs and silkworms, to make extraordinary objects and structures that do all sorts of extraordinary things.Glistening sheets of a honey-colored material were made from a paste of ground-up shrimp shells that varies from opaque to translucent and is embedded with bacteria that has been engineered to capture carbon and turn it into sugar. The stuff also biodegrades on command.\u201cWe treat design more like a gardening practice,\u201d Dr. Oxman said.Preternaturally beautiful, these startling-looking objects have appeared on fashion runways and design fairs, and live in the permanent collections of museums of both art and science, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Smithsonian. And they have made Dr. Oxman, who is rather startling looking herself, a star.Ms. Lam, the software designer, described Dr. Oxman as a contemporary Leonardo da Vinci. John Maeda, the head of computational design at Automattic, a web development company, who also was once an M.I.T. Media Lab darling, said, \u201cIf I was the Terminator, Neri is Terminator 2. I was crappy titanium parts, but she\u2019s like liquid metal.\u201dWhat makes Dr. Oxman, the scientist, so unusual, said Paola Antonelli, the senior curator of architecture and design at MoMA, is her aesthetic sense. \u201cShe\u2019s not afraid of formal elegance,\u201d Ms. Antonelli said. \u201cThe reason why she is a gift to the field of architecture and design is that her science works, her aesthetics work, and her theory works. It\u2019s been interesting to see scientists respond. They welcome the collaboration because they know the research they develop with her team is going to be accepted by their peers and it might even show up in a museum. That it might be beautiful. I\u2019m not afraid to use that word, by the way.\u201dDr. Oxman is on sabbatical this year, but she was in the lab this sweltering day to explain her practice, gulping green tea and gently chastising me for a Diet Coke habit. \u201cI used to be a Coke enthusiast,\u201d she said, \u201cbut now I\u2019m addicted to E. coli.\u201d That bacteria, she said, is known as the workhorse of synthetic biology, which basically means you can make it do anything. Charismatic and epigrammatic, Dr. Oxman speaks as if in capital letters and long, enticing, musical paragraphs.\u201cWhat does it mean to design a living object?\u201d she said. \u201cHow do we accommodate for dimensional mismatches between environmental constraints, light, load, da, da, da and the material? How can you have a single material system that is multifunctional, that is not made of parts and that can vary over space and time for different conditions? Can you make architecture that behaves like a tree.\u201d \u201cI sang a song called \u2018Quicksand,\u2019 which is about a nihilist goth-like person,\u201d Bj\u00f6rk wrote in her email, \u201cso we aimed for biological goth. I remember looking at Mexican death masks but mostly talking about love, to be honest.\u201dTo remind, Mr. Pitt\u2019s interests include architecture, furniture design and urban planning. Dr. Oxman described him \u201cas the last of the Mohicans in post-Netflix Hollywood. He brings together the timely and the timeless,\u201d she said, \u201cwhich is what cinema is all about.\u201d (Dr. Oxman is a Fellini and Ingmar Bergman fan.) She also had some fun with the paparazzi staked out in front of the Media Lab. As she left work during that Pitt period, she made sure to brandish a copy of the Feynman Lectures (a famous physics textbook) and of the Golden Record, the audio time capsule (in the form of an LP, otherwise known as an album or record) that went to Mars in 1977, in a subversive plug for Team Science.\u201cThe Golden Record beats the Caviar quilted flap bag on any given day,\u201d she said. \u201cToting the ultimate message to moon was my message in a bottle to the paparazzi. The Feynman Lectures followed.\u201dA \u201ccoy\u201d piano player who was a first lieutenant in the Israeli air force, Dr. Oxman dropped out of medical school to pursue architecture, and then earned her Ph.D. in design computation at M.I.T. Her heroes are Leonard Bernstein, Buckminster Fuller and her grandmother Miriam, a Sabra, an educator and a gardener.Her parents, both professors, are architectural royalty in Israel. Her father, Robert Oxman, is a theory guy. Her mother, Rivka Oxman, was an early pioneer and booster of artificial intelligence in architectural design.Dr. Oxman is spending part of her sabbatical working on a project for Ms. Antonelli, who is curating the XXII Triennale di Milano international exhibition next March. The theme is \u201cBroken Nature,\u201d an appropriately thorny topic for the times.In response, Dr. Oxman and her group have been experimenting with melanin, the natural pigment found in all six of what biologists call \u201cthe kingdoms of life\u201d (plants, minerals, animals, bacteria and fungi); melanin is also a biomarker of evolution because it has been around since the time of the dinosaurs. What does it mean to engineer melanin? There are obvious boons for tissue repair and sun protection, but what are the implications, she continued, \u201cphilosophically, practically, ethically, humanely, socially and anthropologically for doing such a thing? Up until now, our work has been culturally agnostic. This project takes us further into charged territories.\u201dPractically speaking, she said, her group is imagining a \u201cbiological building,\u201d for Ms. Antonelli\u2019s show. \u201cCould it act as structure and skin, varying its concentration as a function of a site-specific sun path diagram?\u201dIt is Dr. Oxman\u2019s grand ambition, said Moshe Safdie, the Israeli-Canadian architect and urban planner who is a friend and mentor, \u201cto transform the methodology of building. Today we have materials that are translucent and we have materials that are load bearing and she is hoping we would reach the day when we have materials that could behave in multiple ways. Release light and store energy. \u201c\u201cIt is such a grand ambition, I don\u2019t think it will be fulfilled in my life,\u201d said Mr. Safdie, now 80. \u201cI might be wrong.\u201d\u201cBecause she is a gifted artist,\u201d he continued, \u201cwhat comes out through whatever processes she uses are beautiful objects. People are fascinated by these lovely objects. From my perspective, from a wish that her grand ambitions are fulfilled, this is like a sideshow, but it\u2019s a sideshow that gets a lot of attention.\u201dDr. Oxman would adamantly agree.\u201cLook, we haven\u2019t gone this far to sell glass-printed light fixtures on Amazon,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are here and remain committed because we are able to design an architectural \u2018skin\u2019 as an optical lens, thereby opening up possibilities for harnessing solar energy on urban scales. These technologies should not be trivialized for entertainment purposes alone, though potentially profitable solutions such as a biodegradable Pellegrino bottle may well help us cut out plastic. One has to start somewhere without compromising soul.\u201dWhen the lab figured out how to 3-D-print glass, which has all sorts of applications for building facades, Dr. Oxman was wooed by a Chinese billionaire in the fragrance business. \u201cHe said, I\u2019ll give you this amount of millions of dollars if you can produce perfume diffusers by Christmas,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI thought, I\u2019ll take your money, but you won\u2019t see any perfume diffusers. The challenge for me is to scale while maintaining ideological purity. It would be to easy to start a line of melanin makeup. Easy! Vitamin-infused melanin for sun-protection-slash-makeup. Easy! That\u2019s a billion-dollar industry. But why not have an architect enter the race to cure cancer?\u201dAdvertisement"}

When I was younger I was taught that I have to know how to cook for my husband and children and I don\u2019t really like that. So I just didn\u2019t want to learn how to cook at all. But now I think knowing how to cook is a good thing to have \u2014 not for a man or my kids but for myself.When Malala Yousafzai turned 18, she opened a school for Syrian refugee girls, calling on leaders from around the world to provide \u201cbooks not bullets.\u201dIt was at 18 that Cleopatra became ruler of Egypt, in 51 B.C.E., and Victoria the queen of Great Britain, in 1837.By the time she was 18, Britney Spears had had two No. 1 albums on the Billboard chart, and Serena Williams had won the U.S. Open.Emma Gonzalez, 18 now, has become a global leader in the movement to end gun violence.No pressure, right?Eighteen is an age. But it\u2019s also something more. It\u2019s a moment, a rite of passage, a gateway to adulthood.In the United States, 18 means you can finally vote, sign a lease on an apartment, obtain a credit card and buy a Juul.In China and parts of Canada, 18 grants you entrance to a pub, while for most Israelis, it means a mandatory draft into the military.By 18, one in five women across the globe will be married.

So we asked young women photographers to document girls in their communities \u2014 taking the photos and conducting the interviews themselves. Each photographer was paired with a professional mentor to guide them through the process.The result is a celebration of girlhood around the world \u2014 across 12 time zones and 15 languages, featuring 21 subjects and 22 photographers.

Nearly Half of Their Replacements Are Women.", "Date": null, "News": "AdvertisementWho Was Ousted and Who Stepped InProducer and co-founder, the Weinstein CompanyInterimCo-presidents of Lantern EntertainmentTelevision hostPermanentHost, \u201cAmanpour & Company\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen something like this before,\u201d said Joan Williams, a law professor who studies gender at the University of California, Hastings. \u201cWomen have always been seen as risky, because they might do something like have a baby. But men are now being seen as more risky hires.\u201dBut the analysis shows that the #MeToo movement shook, and is still shaking, power structures in society\u2019s most visible sectors. The Times gathered cases of prominent people who lost their main jobs, significant leadership positions or major contracts, and whose ousters were publicly covered in news reports.Forty-three percent of their replacements were women. Of those, one-third are in news media, one-quarter in government, and one-fifth in entertainment and the arts. For example, Robin Wright replaced Kevin Spacey as lead actor on \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d Emily Nemens replaced Lorin Stein as editor of \u201cThe Paris Review,\u201d and Tina Smith replaced Al Franken as a senator from Minnesota.People Replacing Men Accused of Sexual MisconductWomen are starting to gain power in organizations that have been jolted by harassment, with potentially far-reaching effects.\u201cI find it so interesting the number of people who come up to me and say, \u2018Thank you for stepping in when someone needed to step in,\u2019\u201d Ms. Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of what women do a lot of the time, right?\u201dThat has been true in Congress, said Ms. Smith, a Democrat. In a highly polarized Senate, women tend to be unusually collegial across party lines, she said, and the 23 female senators meet for dinner monthly.U.S. senator for MinnesotaResigned after accusations of groping and improper advances from at least six women. He apologized but denied many of the allegations.Interim\u201cI believe you\u2019re successful and you get things done if you have relationships with people,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the ground for accomplishing something, certainly in the legislative world.\u201dOne example: She and Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican from Alaska, discovered that they both worked on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in high school. The bond they built from shared experience helped them when they co-sponsored mental health legislation that was included in the opioid crisis response bill passed last month.In news media and entertainment, many women who ascended to jobs vacated by men have changed the tone and substance of what they offer audiences \u2014 and in some cases, the fallout from #MeToo has shaped their decisions.Head of Amazon StudiosResigned after a Hollywood producer accused him of making unwanted sexual advances.InterimPermanentSince Tanzina Vega took over from John Hockenberry as host of \u201cThe Takeaway,\u201d the public radio program, she has done many episodes about gender, including on masculinity, women\u2019s anger and the intersection of gender and race \u2014 topics that she had been covering for years but that she said were now part of the national conversation.\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily because I\u2019m a woman, but it\u2019s just that as a woman, as a Latina, I know when the conversation hasn\u2019t been about women, and I\u2019m deeply sensitive to that,\u201d said Ms. Vega, who was previously a reporter at CNN and The New York Times.Host of WNYC\u2019s \u201cThe Takeaway\u201dAfter he left \u201cThe Takeaway,\u201d nine women accused Mr. Hockenberry of sexual harassment, including unwelcome sexual advances.

More than 10 percent of the ousted men have tried to make a comeback, or voiced a desire to, and many never lost financial power.When people accused of harassment return to power without making amends \u2014 or never lose it, at least financially \u2014 it limits the post-Weinstein movement\u2019s potential to change how power is exercised in American society.\u201cWhere\u2019s the self-reflection and accountability?\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps if we saw some evidence of that, then we can have a more robust conversation about the road to redemption.\u201dIn the meantime, these women say, there are more than enough qualified women ready to take their places in power.\u201cA bunch of us who took over these jobs got promoted because we were really good at these jobs,\u201d said Ms. Vega, the radio host. \u201cWe have the skills, we have the experience, we have the work ethic and we have the smarts to do it, and it\u2019s time for us to do this job.\u201dThe 98 Men Who Were ReplacedOf the men who lost their jobs, 51 have been replaced by at least one woman in an interim or permanent capacity.

{"Headline": "The Only Hollywood Abuser I Want to Hear From Is a Horse", "Date": "2018-10-04", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byCritic\u2019s NotebookThe reckoning has come for BoJack Horseman. Netflix\u2019s washed-up Hollywood star has recklessly abused his power for four seasons: harassing his ghostwriter, goading his sober co-star into a bender that kills her, coming on to a friend\u2019s teenage daughter.He\u2019s escaped accountability at each turn, all of his messes wiped clean by press agents and glossed over with star power. Only in the new season, to put it in the animated show\u2019s anthropomorphic terms, do the chickens come home to roost. It\u2019s a season about consequences, or the lack thereof. And it gives us an unflinching close-up of a famous abuser that only fiction could pull off right now.How much these shows get out of the issue hinges on how much they put into it. Some collapse trauma into a 20- to 40-minute episode, chopping it into beats and bending it into arcs. But a few understand that the subject is big enough to fill entire seasons.Even the cynical structure of \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny\u201d \u2014 which resets after every episode, releasing its misanthropic bar staff to pinball around the pub again \u2014 feels oddly better suited to the moment. The recent episode \u201cTime\u2019s Up for the Gang\u201d begins with Paddy\u2019s Pub accused of being a danger to women in an online list; it ends with the crew facing zero repercussions and learning nothing, which faithfully represents a typical outcome for menaces like them.\u201cInsecure\u201d intuits that there\u2019s something outdated about the very special episode. It reflects a time when a handful of shows were expected to provide moral guidance on a full range of topical issues. Now there\u2019s so much television, there\u2019s no reason for harassment and abuse to be tidily sewn into a single installment. There\u2019s something to be said for the shows that commit.But perhaps only \u201cBoJack Horseman\u201d feels as if it\u2019s been preparing for this moment for the whole life of the show. Its fifth season sketches in several shades of Hollywood abuse. Vance Waggoner, a Mel Gibson type, keeps offending new groups \u2014 Jews, women, Swedes \u2014 and each time is showered with the industry\u2019s forgiveness despite demonstrating zero personal growth. Flip McVicker, the creator of a tortured noir crime show within the show, flexes his power over actors by forcing them to perform naked. A literal sex robot becomes the head of a television network. Then there\u2019s BoJack, who adds to his long list of crimes against women by choking his co-star girlfriend while high on pills this season.Instead they plead to lesser charges: I\u2019m sorry for being a bad boyfriend; I\u2019m sorry romance is so confusing. We can\u2019t move on to the redemption stage of their narratives when we can\u2019t even agree on the premise.But we all know what BoJack did. Through him, we\u2019re given a rare close-up inspection of the jumbled mess of self-aggrandizement and self-loathing that seems to drive so many public menaces. Investing our attention in BoJack doesn\u2019t enable him; all it does is support a very good television show. Perhaps only fiction can provide this kind of inquiry right now, one that focuses on a man who\u2019s done terrible things, and attempts to figure out what to do with him. It helps that it\u2019s a show that\u2019s as invested in its female characters as it is in its horse. The fifth season is as much about Diane, BoJack\u2019s feminist ghostwriter turned unlikely friend, questioning her complicity in BoJack\u2019s crimes, and her processing her responsibility to both him and the public.Near the end of the season, when BoJack almost strangles that woman on set, he evades public consequences yet again. But his deeds weigh heavy on him, feeding his spiral of self-flagellation, addiction and recklessness. BoJack begs Diane to write a hit piece on him to publicly air every bad thing he\u2019s ever done. She declines. A public performance, she tells him, is no substitute for real personal accountability. She drives him to rehab instead.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "The Week in Arts: Pistol Annies\u2019 New Album; Return of \u2018House of Cards\u2019", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byMiranda Lambert leads the female trio, whose third album, \u201cInterstate Gospel,\u201d is timeless and harmony-laden.There\u2019s plenty of nostalgia in country music, but one area where artists are pushing to modernize is the genre\u2019s gender gap. Conventional country radio wisdom dictates that listeners prefer men\u2019s voices; one radio consultant recently suggested to Elle that the greater appeal of male country singers was actually biological.The Pistol Annies, a trio of women country singers that includes arguably the genre\u2019s biggest female star, Miranda Lambert, would beg to differ \u2014 as would the legions of fans. On Friday, Nov. 2, the same day as a sold-out, upcoming show at Town Hall in Manhattan, the group releases its third album, \u201cInterstate Gospel,\u201d a timeless, harmony-laden album that coincides neatly with a new push for women in country to get a bigger share of the radio airplay pie. (Both the Annies and Carrie Underwood, who is promoting her own new album with an all-woman touring roster, recently performed for an all-woman edition of the CMT Awards.)Frank Underwood, the disgraced 46th President of the United States, is dead and buried in \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d But his ghost is haunting the administration of his widow, Claire, who\u2019d overtaken the Oval Office at the end of last season, even before Kevin Spacey, who played Frank, was fired from the series after sexual assault allegations surfaced.Now it\u2019s Robin Wright\u2019s icy-veined Claire who is breaking the fourth wall as she corrals the usual suspects \u2014 not least Frank\u2019s former henchman, Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), held hostage under psychiatric observation, and Secretary of State Catherine Durant (Jayne Atkinson), still inconveniently alive after that shove down the stairs. But they\u2019re the least of Claire\u2019s worries: The Koch-like industrialists Bill Shepherd (Greg Kinnear) and his sister, Annette (Diane Lane) \u2014 Claire\u2019s erstwhile confidant turned near-mortal enemy \u2014 are trying to fashion her into their puppet.Libraries have been written about the black maid who stands behind the naked white subject of Manet\u2019s \u201cOlympia.\u201d But she\u2019s only the most famous example of the vexing, complicated, and ultimately critical role black figures and models have played in the evolution of modern art. That\u2019s the argument of \u201cPosing Modernity: The Black Model from Manet and Matisse to Today\u201d at Columbia University\u2019s recently renovated and expanded Wallach Art Gallery.When an interviewer asked him to define his art, Ingmar Bergman \u2014 that angsty dissector of the human condition \u2014 let out a deep sigh. \u201cWell, one director said that a film director is someone who has so many problems to deal with that he never has time to think,\u201d he said.It\u2019s a fascinating, occasionally rocky journey, featuring some of Bergman\u2019s favorite actresses, including Liv Ullmann and Gunnel Lindblom; his sons Daniel and Ingmar Jr.; and admiring directors like Olivier Assayas and Ruben Ostlund. Still, curious viewers might long for a deeper dive into Bergman\u2019s own perplexing problems \u2014 say, the interfamilial dynamics (Bergman had nine children with five wives as well as Ullman) that prompted Daniel to proclaim that he did not miss his deceased father at all.Over the past two decades, Akram Khan has made a name for himself as both an inventive choreographer and an exceptional dancer by putting contemporary twists on the classical Indian dance form Kathak. His solo productions are among his most celebrated works, but a dancer can only weather the job\u2019s physical demands for so long. At 44, he has embarked on his final evening-length solo, \u201cXenos,\u201d which will have its United States premiere at Lincoln Center\u2019s annual White Light Festival.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article mischaracterized a performance of Charles Wuorinen's seminal String Trio from 1968.

{"Headline": "Flavor Is a Language, and Like Wine, Candy Has Its Own", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "I learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dNations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales.

The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go.

Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans.

The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era.

Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.)

It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTrade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times.

Her debut novel, \u201cFruit of the Drunken Tree,\u201d was published this summer.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia.

Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go.

Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines.

In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTrade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times.

{"Headline": "Barbra Streisand Can\u2019t Get Trump Out of Her Head. So She Sang About Him.", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "Her new album, \u201cWalls,\u201d is a rare instance of politics permeating her music, and in an interview, she could barely stop talking about her least favorite president.Supported byBarbra Streisand has a new album, one that is the musical embodiment of her singular dislike of President Trump, and the rare instance of her political views entering her music. One track already released, \u201cDon\u2019t Lie to Me,\u201d is a direct address to her fellow native New Yorker who now holds the Oval Office.There are similar messages throughout the album, \u201cWalls,\u201d due on Friday, which also includes a medley of John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine\u201d and Louis Armstrong\u2019s \u201cWhat a Wonderful World.\u201d The title track warns that people now \u201cbuild them where they shouldn\u2019t be.\u201dStreisand drew a blank when asked if she could think of anything positive that Trump has done. But this outspoken Democrat risks annoying, if not alienating, some of her own fans who might agree with the president on a number of issues. If she was concerned about that, she didn\u2019t express it.These are edited excerpts from the conversation.What inspired you to do this album after not being so overtly political in your art?I would lie awake at night with Trump\u2019s outrages running through my head, and I had to do another album for Columbia Records, so I thought, why not make an album about what\u2019s on my mind? And that became the title of the first song. I am so grateful to have music in my life as a way to express myself.Do artists have an obligation to be political now?My first album in 1962 or something like that, my manager was able to get me artistic control. That means no one could tell me what to sing or what to name my album or even what the cover looks like. And that\u2019s important to me.Truth has always worked for me, so to see the truth defiled every day is very, very painful for me. I only can do what I can do. I probably will turn a lot of people off. When I\u2019m creating an album there has to be musicality \u2014 there has to be beauty in the music.I don\u2019t know what people are going to think when they hear what\u2019s on my mind. It may bring up things that are on their mind. \u201cDon\u2019t Lie to Me,\u201d if you don\u2019t look at the video, can be a more general idea. But the music is upbeat, the music is interesting, it\u2019s nice for me, kind of a contemporary track. And it expressed my anger, it expressed my frustration.I can only be true to me as an artist and if people like it that\u2019s great, and if they don\u2019t, they don\u2019t have to buy it or listen to it. But me in real life is more important than me as the artist. As a citizen, that\u2019s the role.What about offending Trump fans who like your music?It doesn\u2019t matter. I remember being onstage in Washington, D.C., and asking, \u201cI\u2019m just curious, how many Republicans are in the audience?\u201d because everyone knows I\u2019m a staunch Democrat, and a lot of people raised their hands. Art or music transcends politics, I think. I hope it does. I actually said that to George Bush.Can you think of anything good Trump has done? [Very long pause] I mean, this is a man who\u2019s kind of, not kind of \u2014 he\u2019s mean. I worry about the children. I worry about what is the image he\u2019s projecting to them.How do you feel about how the music industry has dealt with #MeToo? The music industry, I didn\u2019t have a lot of problems there. I mean, it depends on how many records you sell, you know what I\u2019m saying, whether you\u2019re male or female. It matters more in directing. The idea of being in control doesn\u2019t go over well.I think that\u2019s what happened with Hillary Clinton. I mean, a woman of substance, an articulate, experienced in government, dignified, who had everything I thought would make her become a wonderful president of the United States, that doesn\u2019t seem to matter because I think powerful women, strong women are viewed with suspicion.Are you glad women are fighting back?I\u2019m glad they\u2019re fighting back, although when it comes to somebody like Al Franken, I\u2019m dismayed and I think he was right when he said at the beginning, I\u2019ll resign when Trump resigns, for somebody, too, who has been accused of assaulting at least three women and he\u2019s the president of the United States.What was the evolution of this album?Originally I was going to call the album \u201cWhat\u2019s on My Mind.\u201d I try to always go back to ideas that are more universal that people can relate to.[The songwriters] wrote the most beautiful words about what I was thinking. You know it\u2019s interesting, I had a conversation with Bob Dole recently.Do you speak with him frequently?I\u2019ve never spoken to him before. But actually I got a call from President Clinton\u2019s office that said Bob Dole would like to speak with you, and they said, would you speak with him? [Dole reached out via the former president\u2019s office because of the Clintons\u2019 relationship with Streisand.] I said, of course I\u2019ll speak with him. Bob Dole was so lovely, he said to me that he was recuperating from a yearlong illness and he wanted to tell me how powerfully my music helped him recuperate.And he reminded me of how when he was the leader of the Senate, he was always crossing the aisle and working with George Mitchell. McCain, I was fond of John McCain. In other words, you can agree to disagree.[Returning to an earlier question about Trump] He\u2019s a great marketer. You asked me what I think he\u2019s good at? He\u2019s good at marketing.Have you met Trump?No, but when I was editing my last TV special for Netflix and we were looking at audience shots, there he was sitting next to Barbara Walters, but he never came backstage to see me or meet me. So I never met him.Does it surprise you to think that both you and he came from the same city?No, because I think that\u2019s great about New York. I mean, I didn\u2019t know people from the Bronx. I lived in Brooklyn. Bronx people seemed different than Brooklyn people.When was the last time you were back in Brooklyn?By the way, what I think he\u2019s really doing now, is trying to reverse reality. When you say something loud enough and long enough people will believe you. Doesn\u2019t democracy hinge on the truth?Have you seen the \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d remake?I haven\u2019t seen it completed. Bradley [Cooper] did show me the opening. I was surprised by how similar it was to my version. I loved how he used the drag bar. I thought that was new and interesting. What I\u2019ve seen of the film I really liked.How are you feeling these days?I want to sleep nights, if we take the House I\u2019ll be able to sleep a little bit better.And if they don\u2019t? Don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been thinking about, do I want to move to Canada? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just so saddened by this thing happening to our country. It\u2019s making me fat. I hear what he said now, and I have to go eat pancakes now, and pancakes are very fattening. We make them with healthy flour, though \u2014 almond flour, coconut flour.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "In Battle With Amazon, Walmart Pushes Deeper Into Entertainment", "Date": "2018-10-11", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWalmart is going Hollywood.Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has agreed to create short-form original series for Walmart\u2019s ad-supported streaming service, Vudu. Those are expected to debut early next year. It is the first of many studios that Walmart expects to work with in creating new content for Vudu, a spokesman for the retailer said Wednesday.Walmart is also investing in a joint venture with Eko, a New York start-up that focuses on \u201cinteractive storytelling,\u201d a video format that allows viewers to control the plot of commercials and television episodes.The investment with Eko totals $250 million, according to two people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the deal. It is thought to be the largest bet on the interactive entertainment niche, which has long tantalized producers as a potential gold mine but has never gained widespread adoption.\u201cWe are not trying to become a studio,\u201d said Scott McCall, a senior vice president for entertainment, toys and seasonal at Walmart. \u201cIt is our hope that we will work with studios to reimagine what new content looks like.\u201dWalmart\u2019s substantial investment is a validation for Eko, which was co-founded by the 37-year-old Yoni Bloch, who described himself in an interview in his New York office as \u201ca relatively famous singer in Israel.\u201d He has also been a judge on the Israeli version of \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201dWalmart was introduced to Eko when the retailer\u2019s chief executive, Doug McMillon, met Mr. Bloch while visiting Israel last year.The two companies started working together on an interactive presentation that Eko prepared for Walmart\u2019s shareholder meeting \u2014 the annual corporate pep rally in Bentonville attended by thousands of workers.Walmart sees interactive storytelling \u2014 essentially a video version of \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d books \u2014 as something that can be used in both entertainment and advertising.There could be a cooking show, for instance, that helps viewers buy the ingredients online as they watch. Or a love story in which viewers can choose what happens to the characters. In turn, each choice could help Walmart glean insight into the viewers\u2019 preferences and attitudes.\u201cThe idea is around leapfrogging what everyone else is doing,\u201d Mr. Bloch said.A cross between a video game and traditional television, interactive storytelling has been held back by technology hurdles and tricky funding. Making one great traditional ad or TV episode is expensive enough, much less one that branches off in different directions depending on what choices people make while viewing.Interactive content has also been hindered by a generational divide. Older consumers \u2014 and media executives \u2014 are accustomed to a passive viewing experience and have a hard time grasping this way of participating in storytelling. Younger viewers are the opposite. (Netflix already has a few interactive shows aimed at children.)Eko is far from alone in chasing the promise of interactive content, but it has a secret weapon: Nancy Tellem. Ms. Tellem, who is Eko\u2019s executive chairman (and also sits on the MGM board), gives Eko considerable credibility in Hollywood. She worked in senior jobs at CBS and Warner Bros. Television for roughly two decades before joining Microsoft in 2012 to create an Xbox-centered television business. Microsoft shut down her division in 2015.For Mr. Bloch, Walmart reminds him of youthful visits to the United States.\u201cWalmart was to me the symbol of America,\u201d he said. \u201cI just remember my mom said we have to go to Walmart because everything is big and cheap there.\u201dHe started his company in 2010 with his bandmates, many of whom had a background in computing.Eko has attracted investments from Silicon Valley firms like Sequoia Capital, as well as establishment backers like Warner Music and Intel. In addition to the $250 million investment in the joint venture, Walmart has invested an undisclosed amount in Eko directly.Many of the details about the joint venture are still being worked out \u2014 like where these shows or advertisements can be viewed. Walmart and Eko said they would share in any revenue.The first project to come from the MGM partnership, which was announced at a conference on Wednesday in Los Angeles, will be a \u201creimagining\u201d of the comedy \u201cMr. Mom,\u201d which will debut on Vudu early next year.Mr. McCall said Vudu would work with MGM on revitalizing other classic movies and creating entirely new content.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated which title was Eko\u2019s first full-length interactive series. As another caption noted, it was \u201cThat Moment When,\u201d not \u201c#WarGames.\u201dAdvertisement"}
{"Headline": "Netflix Keeps Adding Subscribers, and Market Investors Could Profit", "Date": "2018-10-16", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by__________More people sitting around watching Netflix may help rekindle some animal spirits in the stock market.The company on Tuesday reported that many more people signed up for its video-streaming service in the third quarter than expected. Netflix\u2019s shares soared as much as 13 percent in the trading that takes place after regular market hours.After the stock market suffered a steep swoon this month, results like that should help stocks recover. Netflix\u2019s report was the first from one of the big technology companies that helped drive the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index to a record last month.Investors have charted the performance of these tech stocks by bunching them into a group they call FAANG, which includes Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Their contribution to the overall market has been significant. In the 12 months through Monday, the S. & P. 500 had risen 7.7 percent, but without the five technology stocks its performance was only 5.2 percent, according to an analysis by Credit Suisse.Netflix is the priciest of the five prominent technology companies. This makes it a good barometer for the amount of bullishness in the stock market. If the stock keeps rising over the coming weeks, it will underscore that investors still have a strong appetite for riskier companies, an attitude that might spill over into other technology firms.As Netflix\u2019s third-quarter results showed, it is doing well in some respects. It added seven million subscribers in the period, a larger amount than it added in the third quarter of last year. But the company is also consuming large sums of cash to finance its growth and borrowing more to cover its shortfall. Netflix also faces serious competitive threats, like Disney\u2019s plan to set up its own subscription video service.Yet an important stock market yardstick \u2014 the price-earnings ratio \u2014 suggests investors have an almost unquestioning faith in Netflix\u2019s ability to notch fast-growing earnings. This ratio compares its stock price with its earnings. Take a company with a stock trading at $100. If investors expect it to make $10 per share (its net income divided by the number of shares it has issued), it would have a price-earnings ratio of 10.The ratio for the companies in the S. & P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.Of course, it\u2019s still early in the earnings reporting season \u2014 and jarring disappointments may occur. Facebook is facing mounting regulatory scrutiny and is spending large sums on making its network more secure. Apple is trying to increase its revenue in part by selling higher-priced phones that may turn off some consumers.Outside of the technology space, investors are concerned that President Trump\u2019s trade wars may hurt the earnings of large manufacturing companies.But after stocks had a wobbly start to October, strong earnings have already helped reassure investors. Before Netflix reported its performance, two well-known Wall Street firms, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, reported earnings that provided more evidence that the banking sector is in a good position to finance economic growth.After those reports and a few others, the S. & P. 500 jumped 2.15 percent, its biggest single-day gain since March.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Why Following Your Passions Is Good for You (and How to Get Started)", "Date": "2018-10-10", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byWhether you plan to turn your hobby into a career, or just use it as a release valve for the stresses in your life, here\u2019s how to find time for a little self-care.\u201cEven if it hadn\u2019t become my career and completely changed my life, the late nights spent tinkering after work would\u2019ve been worth it,\u201d Mr. Rea said. \u201cI was cooking again, I was filming again, I was happy again.\u201dWhether you\u2019re looking to cultivate a hobby as a professional steppingstone, or just to feel more fulfilled, extracurricular activities carry measurable benefits. And even if you don\u2019t have a passion that really stokes your flames, there\u2019s hope for you, too. We\u2019re all busy. Whether we\u2019re juggling demanding careers, family life or both, most of us feel as if we can\u2019t cram anything more into our schedules. But Ms. Vanderkam wants to dispel that idea. \u201cWhen you say you don\u2019t have time, what you\u2019re really saying is, it\u2019s not a priority,\u201d she said. While there are definitely moments in which we legitimately don\u2019t have time to spare, most of us can find a little time if we know how to look.Once you find those free hours, it\u2019s all about using them effectively and motivating yourself. Going to bed an hour earlier a couple of nights a week might allow you to get up an hour sooner and use that time. If you have children, consider trading \u201cfree days\u201d with a friend or neighbor, switching off kid duty for a few hours on the weekends. It may feel like you\u2019re trading your precious \u201cfree\u201d time for another item on your to-do list, but a pet project you\u2019re passionate about is probably better than Netflix, and one that\u2019ll leave you feeling more energized and rewarded.\u201cWhen you did activities as a kid, they were often built in \u2014 there was an adult forcing you to go,\u201d Ms. Vanderkam added. \u201cAs an adult, you\u2019re fully responsible for that. Many people find it easier to let go of promises they make to themselves.\u201dWhereas Mr. Rea has millions of subscribers waiting for him to drop a new video, most of us don\u2019t have anyone relying on us to write those pages, paint that picture, or get into downward dog. Sometimes we all need a little external motivation.\u201cTurn your passion into an obligation,\u201d Ms. Vanderkam advised. \u201cIf you want to take up woodworking, take a class. If you\u2019ve paid for it, you\u2019re more likely to show up.\u201dIf you\u2019re prone to procrastination, start small and specific. Maybe you want to hone your cooking skills, but take one look at the cupboard and end up ordering in. Procrastination often happens when we get overwhelmed and stall before we even start. \u201cTaking very small steps is key,\u201d Ms. Vanderkam said. \u201cIf you take small steps repeatedly, they really do add up.\u201dKnowing your road map is also essential, especially if you want to turn your passion into a career. Make a mental picture of where you want to be in five years, then work backward. \u201cPeople often overestimate what they can do in the short term and underestimate what they can do in the long run,\u201d Ms. Vanderkam explained. \u201cSay, I\u2019m going to do just three things today. That\u2019s 15 things per workweek; that\u2019s 750 things in a year. If you do 750 important things in a year, that\u2019s a pretty good year.\u201dWhile hobbies both enrich our lives and can turn into rewarding careers, those of us who don\u2019t have a particular obsession aren\u2019t hopelessly out of luck. Instead, cultivate skills that will give you a leg up in your field. We all carry a \u201ctoolbox\u201d to work in the form of specific abilities that make us better at our jobs. Some experts say leveling up on some of these will improve your job satisfaction more than initial enthusiasm ever will.Instead, Dr. Newport recommends cultivating skills within your current framework. \u201cAs you get better at things that are very valuable, you acquire more career capital,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is this career capital that you can then turn around and invest into your career, to get things that makes it a deeper source of meaning, passion, or satisfaction.\u201dJust like pursuing hobbies, this takes personal initiative. \u201cIt is not enough to just learn about something; it\u2019s also not enough just to do something a lot,\u201d Dr. Newport said. \u201cYou actually have to deliberately practice the skill, which means you have to stretch yourself beyond where you\u2019re comfortable, if you\u2019re going to actually improve.\u201d He recommends thinking about these skills as a professional musician thinks about hers, and pursue more and more challenges accordingly.Whether you engage in a hobby for its own sake or as a career driver, self-improvement is a win-win.\u201cIf you open yourself to new experiences by gradually stepping outside your comfort zone, you can find the things that truly make you happy,\u201d Mr. Rea explained. \u201cAnd whether those things become hobbies or your life\u2019s work, pursuing your passions can give you a renewed sense of meaning and accomplishment.\u201dWe can all use a little more of that, regardless of where we find it.

During a meeting this month, Ms. Kelly and Mr. Lack discussed a possible winding-down of her portion of the \u201cToday\u201d show by the end of the year, according to two people briefed on the conversation. And Ms. Kelly has expressed among friends her dissatisfaction with its top news executives.Late Wednesday, Ms. Kelly and her Hollywood talent agency, Creative Artists Agency, ended their relationship, according to two people informed of the decision.With a reported annual salary of $17 million and the NBC hype machine in full swing, Ms. Kelly, 47, arrived at 30 Rockefeller Plaza last spring hoping to become the first Fox News personality to successfully leap to the gentler realm of morning network TV.Instead, she has struggled to attract viewers and offended celebrity guests (notably the actress Jane Fonda). She also alienated some \u201cToday\u201d show colleagues with her coverage of in-house harassment scandals involving Matt Lauer, the former \u201cToday\u201d anchor, and Tom Brokaw, the former NBC anchor, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.On Tuesday\u2019s show, her comments \u2014 in which she suggested to her guests that, when she was a child, dressing in blackface was accepted \u201cas long as you were dressing up as a character\u201d \u2014 left many NBC News employees stunned and exasperated. At a post-broadcast meeting, members of Ms. Kelly\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d team expressed discomfort with what she had said on-air, according to several people briefed on the discussion, although Ms. Kelly was not present.Several hours later, she emailed an apology to colleagues. \u201cThe history of blackface in our culture is abhorrent; the wounds too deep,\u201d Ms. Kelly wrote. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a \u2018pc\u2019 kind of person \u2014 but I understand that we do need to be more sensitive in this day and age.\u201d\u201cNBC Nightly News\u201d devoted segments to Ms. Kelly\u2019s remarks during its Tuesday and Wednesday editions. On Tuesday, the broadcast included a Fox News clip from 2013 in which Ms. Kelly weighed in on the race of Santa Claus. \u201cFor all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white,\u201d she said. That same clip was shown again during Wednesday\u2019s 7 a.m. hour of \u201cToday.\u201dFor NBC News, the \u201cblackface\u201d flare-up was yet another headache.The news division has come under scrutiny for what its executives may have known about the workplace behavior of Mr. Lauer before he was fired in 2017 after allegations of sexual harassment were made against him. In May, an NBC investigation cleared network executives of any wrongdoing in the matter, but drew criticism because it was conducted by in-house counsel, rather than an outside law firm.Ms. Kelly covered each of those episodes extensively on her morning show. Last month, she suggested on the air that outside investigators should look into the matter of NBC\u2019s handling of the Farrow story.On-air errors, even contentious ones, can sometimes be smoothed over if an anchor has big ratings. But in her first year at NBC, Ms. Kelly\u2019s portion of \u201cToday\u201d has averaged 2.4 million viewers, a drop of nearly 400,000 from the same hour\u2019s average before her arrival, according to Nielsen. Ms. Kelly has also trailed a rival morning program, \u201cLive With Kelly and Ryan,\u201d by a wide margin.Her \u201cblackface\u201d remarks on Tuesday could further complicate her job. A Netflix spokeswoman said on Wednesday that cast members of the political drama \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d had decided to pull out of a scheduled appearance on \u201cMegyn Kelly Today.\u201dAdvertisement"}

It was a producer on HBO\u2019s acclaimed thriller \u201cSharp Objects\u201d this summer and the Emmy-winning documentary series \u201cThe Jinx\u201d in 2015. But it has also been behind a series of forgettable one-season flops like \u201cThe River\u201d (ABC), \u201cStranded\u201d (Syfy), \u201cEye Candy\u201d (MTV) and \u201cSouth of Hell\u201d (WE TV).The anthology series on Hulu will consist of a new television movie under the \u201cInto the Dark\u201d banner every month for the next year. In addition, there is a television adaptation of the Blumhouse franchise \u201cThe Purge\u201d on USA, and \u201cSacred Lies,\u201d a young-adult drama on Facebook Watch. Going into production next month for Showtime is an adaptation of a Roger Ailes biography starring Russell Crowe. Several other projects are in production, including unscripted series.In other words, not too many ghosts. Blumhouse executives explained that only 20 percent of the studio\u2019s television projects will be traditional horror fare. (The movie division is somewhere closer to 80 percent, Mr. Blum said.)Or, as Mr. Gold put it, \u201cit\u2019s simple sales: To only be peddling horror, that\u2019s not a great way to scale a whole studio.\u201dMs. Wiseman and Mr. Gold were speaking from the no-frills, cramped headquarters of Blumhouse in Historic Filipinotown. The pair work out of a small box of a room where a glass wall separates the roughly five feet of space between their seats. They often communicate by taping Post-it notes to the glass.\u201cThat\u2019s the thing with Blumhouse: You have all this production, but we don\u2019t have a lot of space!\u201d Ms. Wiseman said.When Mr. Blum hired Ms. Wiseman and Mr. Gold, he also decided to rip up his game plan for television. He wanted to build a studio where Blumhouse would be calling the shots.\u201cIn the movies, we\u2019re running everything. We make all the decisions,\u201d Mr. Blum said in an interview. \u201cOn the production, we\u2019re in charge 100 percent. And so I\u2019d go from that to television, where I was asking permission to brush my teeth. For everything! It was extremely frustrating.\u201dStill, Mr. Blum described building a successful independent studio as a big financial risk.\u201cIt is harder than ever to cut through the clutter,\u201d said Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. \u201cThe flip side to that there is more opportunity for independent players to develop content. It\u2019s harder to have massive audiences but it\u2019s also easier to find someone take a chance on quality content.\u201dOne of the first orders of business for the television unit was to discard the company\u2019s policy of shoestring budgets. The reason? Streaming services like Netflix, HBO and Amazon are more than happy to spend more on one episode of a TV series \u2014 $5 million plus \u2014 than Blumhouse does on some of its feature films.\u201cI\u2019m not saying people are saying, \u2018Please spend as much money as possible,\u2019\u201d Ms. Wiseman said. \u201cBut there are just a bunch of buyers that are not price-sensitive.\u201dIf it works, they\u2019ll have continuing series on basic cable and streaming services. And they\u2019ll have glossy shows, like \u201cSharp Objects\u201d or the Ailes limited series, where, Ms. Wiseman explained, \u201cthe economics may not be as fantastic but the kind of heightened storytelling is really the goal.\u201d Essentially, to burnish the reputation of the Blumhouse brand.\u201cInto the Dark\u201d is one of the projects reminiscent of its Blumhouse film brethren. The show is cheap to make \u2014 right around $2 million per television movie \u2014 and it will be horror oriented.And if \u201cInto the Dark\u201d is not generating as much attention as \u201cThe Hill of Haunting House\u201d \u2014 neither Hulu nor Netflix discloses viewership statistics \u2014 everyone is urging patience.\u201cI don\u2019t know if \u2018Into the Dark\u2019 is going to work or not,\u201d Mr. Blum said. \u201cIs it good that people aren\u2019t talking about it? Of course not. I want more people to talk about it. But I don\u2019t know what metric to use.\u201dMeanwhile, the TV adaptation of \u201cThe Purge\u201d has shown solid results in the six weeks it has been on USA, averaging roughly two million viewers, according to Nielsen\u2019s delayed-viewing data.It is USA\u2019s biggest ratings get of the year among adults under 50, though the numbers were not big enough to crack the top-five-rated scripted cable shows in recent weeks.It\u2019s not yet known if USA will pick up another installment of what was supposed to be a limited series \u2014 establishing continuing shows is a big priority for Blumhouse \u2014 but Ms. Wiseman and Mr. Gold are happy with the show\u2019s performance.\u201c\u2018The Purge\u2019 is a favorite for a different reason,\u201d Ms. Wiseman said, \u201cbecause could we step up and play with our brothers and sisters on the feature side and say we\u2019re not going to ruin your brand.\u201dMr. Gold chimed in, \u201cOr to put it another way: It didn\u2019t feel like a good move to be the team that screwed that up for everybody!\u201dAdvertisement"}

{"Headline": "Netflix\u2019s Audience Is Multiplying. But So Is Its Debt.", "Date": "2018-10-26", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byStrategiesNetflix, the streaming-video juggernaut, is growing with astonishing speed. And if you ignore the fact that it borrows billions to finance that growth, the company is a classic success story.Wall Street has embraced Netflix as one of the so-called Faangs \u2014 short for Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google (which trades as Alphabet). The technology titans propelled investors to enormous profits for much of this year.With Netflix\u2019s resounding success in forging \u2014 and, so far, dominating \u2014 the global market for streaming video, it may seem churlish to harbor any misgivings.Yet Netflix poses a difficult problem for investors. All of those movies and TV shows are expensive, and in order to fuel its explosive expansion, the company has been spending faster than it has been taking in cash \u2014 and expects to keep doing so for years. Netflix has built its business on a mountain of junk-rated debt.Not everyone is persuaded, however.\u201cNetflix\u2019s fundamental business model seems unsustainable,\u201d said Aswath Damodaran, a New York University finance professor, who has examined the company\u2019s numbers closely. \u201cI don\u2019t see how it is going to work out.\u201dWith increased competition looming in streaming video, he said, Netflix must keep spending enormous sums on content and marketing. If it cuts spending, he said, it is likely to lose much of its precious audience.\u201cSure, the company is growing rapidly now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has an amazing number of new movies and TV shows. For a consumer, that\u2019s great. But for an investor, it\u2019s a different story: The more Netflix grows, the more its costs grow and the more money it burns. I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s ever going to turn that around.\u201dThe company\u2019s shares, in his estimation, are worth buying as a serious investment only at about $177. But Netflix has been trading around $310 a share lately, after surpassing $400 earlier this year.In a nutshell, the problem is the disparity between money in and money out \u2014 and Professor Damodaran\u2019s presumption that Netflix\u2019s costs must remain high, if it is to keep growing.Netflix\u2019s cash-flow statement indicates that in the 12 months through September, it spent $11.7 billion on new content. But its income statement indicates that total revenues were $14.9 billion, leaving it only about $3.2 billion to pay for marketing and the rest of its operations. That wasn\u2019t enough to run the business, so the company has borrowed money.Professor Damodaran is not the only Netflix skeptic. In a note to investors on Oct. 17, Michael Nathanson, a senior analyst with MoffettNathanson, said that the company\u2019s stock price was baffling, and he estimated that a more realistic level was about $210.In a similar vein, Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research for Wedbush Securities and a longtime critic, said he expected Netflix to continue to have difficulty matching costs and cash flow, given increasing competition in streaming video \u2014 and the likely loss of movies and TV shows controlled by its competitors.Disney and Time Warner (which owns HBO) are revamping their offerings. And Hulu (owned collectively by Disney and Comcast), Apple, Amazon and Google (which owns YouTube) are now all serious adversaries, he said. In his estimation, Netflix stock is worth only about $150 a share.If Netflix were to fall anywhere near that level \u2014 losing a gut-wrenching half of its market value \u2014 its corporate competitors would presumably be powering ahead with their own streaming offerings. Yet it would not be surprising if some of them \u2014 the recently merged AT&T-Time Warner entity, for example \u2014 wondered whether their own marriages made much sense without Netflix\u2019s unbidden influence.How worried should the stock market be about Netflix? It has shrugged off such concerns most of this year: From Jan. 1 through July 9, Netflix\u2019s shares returned a staggering 118 percent.Since July 9, however, tech stocks have fallen and Netflix has been pummeled. Despite brief surges, its share price has dropped more than 25 percent since that peak.\u201cYou get a show or a movie you\u2019re really dying to watch, and you end up staying up late at night, so we actually compete with sleep,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re winning!\u201dIn the latest earnings call, he said that deep-pocketed companies, like Disney, AT&T and Google, were real competitors. \u201cSomeday there will have to be competition for wallet share; we\u2019re not na\u00efve about that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it seems very far off from everything we\u2019ve seen.\u201dNetflix, he said, needs to continue to be \u201cfocusing on our fundamentals\u201d \u2014 supplying viewers with compelling entertainment and delivering it in innovative ways.But that will cost the company a lot of money. For consumers, that may not be a problem at all. Netflix has already made video entertainment far more abundant and diverse than it was just a few years ago, and as other companies join the fray, the cornucopia of choices is likely to become even deeper.But does that make Netflix a great stock? You may want to look closely at the numbers.Follow Jeff Sommer on Twitter: @jeffsommerAdvertisement"}

And now that competition could extend into a battle for investors as the companies push for stock market debuts in 2019.The first to go public would get dibs on investors eager for a piece of the ride-hailing business. That could be especially important for Lyft, given that its I.P.O. would most likely be swamped by its much bigger rival\u2019s, whose offering would be the biggest to hit the market since Alibaba\u2019s in 2014.Positive earnings reports, including from Goldman Sachs and Netflix, were factors, as were strong economic data, which showed a fourth straight month of industrial production gains and job openings at a record high.The ratio for the companies in the S.&P. 500 is currently 17.8 times the earnings they are expected to make this year, according to data from S. & P. Netflix\u2019s multiple, at 145 times, is far higher. It\u2019s so much larger because investors expect Netflix\u2019s earnings to grow more quickly than those of other companies.That level of investor risk-taking could augur well for the stock market, Mr. Eavis writes \u2014 but may evaporate if another big tech company, like Facebook, delivers disappointing earnings.To make the strategy work, the administration is counting on its relationship with the Saudis to keep global oil flowing without spiking prices, and to work together on a new policy to contain Iran in the Persian Gulf.Richard Haas of the Council on Foreign Relations summed up the fine line Mr. Trump must walk: \u201cIt\u2019s a neat trick if you can both sanction a country and partner with them at the same time.\u201dJudge Alison Nathan of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York said that the settlements were \u201cfair, reasonable and will serve the interests of the public and investors.\u201d She did not mention Mr. Musk\u2019s more recent Twitter antics, such as a tweet where he appeared to call the agency the \u201cShortseller Enrichment Commission.\u201dGoogle has always made its Android operating system available for free. It\u2019s a way to get its apps on as many devices as possible, and to collect data about users and sell advertising. But in Europe, it will now charge handset manufacturers to install apps like Gmail and Google Maps.It\u2019s a response to a European antitrust ruling in July that hit Google with a roughly $5 billion fine for unfairly bundling free Android services to maintain its market dominance. (Google is appealing the decision, but it faced a deadline by which it had to change operations or risk further punishment.)The ultimate effect of the change announced on Tuesday remains to be seen, but European customers will probably see a wider variety of Android devices to choose from. Some will come with Google\u2019s services; others may more prominently feature applications made by competitors.\u201cThe potential amount of debt is an iceberg with titanic credit risks,\u201d S.&P. credit analysts led by Gloria Lu wrote in a report Tuesday. Much of the buildup relates to local government financing vehicles, which don\u2019t necessarily have the full financial backing of local governments themselves.That may be a big worry: China\u2019s economy has slowed and defaults have risen this year.

It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales.

The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go.

Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans.

The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making.

Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.)

Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTrade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times.

At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco.

And is Netflix the place where it belongs?If the post-Jon Stewart era of television once looked like a potential paradise for any host with a political perspective and a few zingers about the Trump administration, it is now a battlefield littered with casualties.Maybe there\u2019s no way for topical comedy to succeed on streaming TV and maybe Minhaj is doomed before he starts. But Minhaj doesn\u2019t see it this way.\u201cIf we get this wrong, well, it\u2019s what everyone predicted,\u201d he told me a few days before the test show. \u201cBut if we get this right?\u201d His eyes widened and a grin spread across his face. \u201cIt feels like \u2018Rocky\u2019 1 all over again.\u201dOn an earlier morning in September, Minhaj and about 20 of his \u201cPatriot Act\u201d colleagues were in the bowels of their midtown Manhattan office, gathered around an enormous TV (and a basket of croissants) for what they called a \u201cpre-viz\u201d meeting.The monitor showed a computer rendering of the \u201cPatriot Act\u201d stage, on which stood a small digital silhouette of Minhaj. The flesh-and-blood comedian was sitting on a couch, dressed in athleisure clothes and a pair of Air Jordans as he read from the script for his affirmative action monologue.On screen, bar graphs rose and fell like roller coasters and pie charts exploded into existence while Minhaj recited admissions figures for elite colleges. (Noting that Caltech had nine black students in 2012, he quipped, \u201cThere are more black people in the Wu-Tang Clan.\u201d)Amid the deluge of data and punch lines, Minhaj was also weaving a personal story: one of growing up a proud first-generation American in Davis, Calif., while navigating a murky ecosystem of race and class.In his college-prep classes, Minhaj said, he was told not to declare himself an Asian on his application forms or he\u2019d risk the penalty of a possible racial quota.\u201cI thought I wasn\u2019t going to get into Stanford because some black kid was going to take my spot,\u201d he said in the monologue. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t get into Stanford because I was dumb.\u201d (This is his modest way of saying he cracked 1300 on his SAT exam.)On paper, Minhaj is very much a grown-up: a husband of three years to his wife, Beena, a management consultant, and father to their daughter, who was born in March. But in person, he has a childlike buoyancy, kept aloft by his lifelong loves of hip-hop and professional basketball and his occasional tendency to talk like an internet meme come to life. He\u2019ll say aloud a phrase like \u201ctools\u2192clear history\u201d when he means he\u2019s trying to put something out of his mind.In late 2014, he was hired as a \u201cDaily Show\u201d correspondent. \u201cHe was just undeniable,\u201d Jon Stewart said of him. \u201cI can teach the false-news correspondent mechanics, but not the singularity of someone\u2019s talent. When you get somebody like that, who\u2019s a great storyteller, introspective and humble, you just go: \u2018O.K. We\u2019re done. He\u2019s good.\u2019\u201dOnly a few months later, Stewart announced his departure from the program. Minhaj said he couldn\u2019t forget his admired boss\u2019s explanation for why he was leaving: \u201cJon was like, \u2018I\u2019ve manipulated this chess piece in every single way I could. There\u2019s no further place that I can take it.\u2019\u201d The message to Minhaj was clear, even then, that he had to start thinking about his own next moves.When Trevor Noah took over at \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Minhaj was seen as something of a curiosity there. \u201cHasan was intrinsically different from all of the caricatures and archetypes of what \u2018Daily Show\u2019 correspondents had been,\u201d Noah told me. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t snide, he wasn\u2019t sarcastic \u2014 he was just a different person.\u201dHis breakout opportunities arrived elsewhere. First was his one-man show, \u201cHomecoming King,\u201d which he started performing live in 2014 and released as a Netflix special last year. It is his exuberant recitation of his origin story, of learning the ropes from his father (while his mother studied at medical school in India) and confronting bias and bigotry in America.\u201cHomecoming King\u201d also established a signature visual style for Minhaj\u2019s stage show, full of vivid digital graphics and screencaps from social media. It led to his invitation to host the White House Correspondents Dinner at perhaps the worst possible moment, when President Trump had already announced he would not attend, media organizations were questioning whether the event should even go forward and Minhaj said he knew the gig was \u201cradioactive.\u201d\u201cHow far down the totem pole do you have to go to be like, \u2018Let\u2019s get the second- or third-most popular correspondent on \u2018The Daily Show\u2019?\u2019\u201d he said.Minhaj knew that he\u2019d been underestimated and he used this to his advantage. He delivered a stirring routine that was less a taunting of Trump officials than a reminder to the journalists watching of the weighty responsibility facing them.\u201cIn the age of Trump,\u201d he said in his speech, \u201cI know that you guys have to be more perfect now more than ever. Because you are how the president gets his news.\u201dHe added: \u201cYou can\u2019t make any mistakes. Because when one of you messes up, he blames your entire group. And now you know what it feels like to be a minority.\u201dLooking back on the experience over lunch at a Greek restaurant near his office, Minhaj told me this was a pivotal career moment, not because he got good reviews or because he resisted the advice of fellow comedians who told him he had to (metaphorically) burn the room down.What he learned that night \u2014 though he\u2019d already suspected as much \u2014 was that he wasn\u2019t a slinger of one-liners so much as a designer of narratives. \u201cI want to be surgical,\u201d Minhaj said. \u201cI want to build to a moment.\u201dWhen Netflix pursued him, in the afterglow of the White House Correspondents Dinner, to create a series for them, Minhaj had a very clear sense of what he didn\u2019t want to do.He took out his phone and showed me a series of photos from other late-night shows \u2014 all the hosts you\u2019d expect \u2014 seated at their desks in identical poses with graphics placed in identical locations above their shoulders.His voice was uncharacteristically ferocious as he swiped through the photos. \u201cIt. Doesn\u2019t. Matter. The. Network. It all. Stays. The same. I swear. To. God,\u201d Minhaj said.If he didn\u2019t assert himself and find his own approach, he said, \u201cI was going to be in a suit, behind a desk, in front of a fake city skyline, and people would be, like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s Indian John Oliver.\u2019\u201dIn their international travels, Minhaj and his collaborators were seeing \u201cHomecoming King\u201d and his correspondents dinner performance connect with a global viewership.Prashanth Venkataramanujam, a fellow comedian and longtime friend who worked with Minhaj on these routines, said they began to devise a plan for tapping into this underrepresented audience.\u201cHow do we talk about subjects that just don\u2019t normally make it into the mainstream conversation?\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the ability to find a thesis and then work our way backwards from it.\u201dThe news stories he should focus on, Minhaj said, were the ones in which he felt some sense of personal investment. \u201cNot, do I have a take?\u201d he said. \u201cBut do I have the best take? I have no desire to be the 19th hyena jumping on the carcass. Do I have something of value to add? Then let\u2019s do it.\u201dOver a period of months, Minhaj workshopped some routines (like the one about affirmative action) at the Fat Black Pussycat in Manhattan. He spent his own money to produce a proof-of-concept video for \u201cPatriot Act\u201d \u2014 essentially, a rough pilot episode that he could show to Netflix and other broadcasters.It closely approximates how Minhaj intends to present \u201cPatriot Act\u201d now: with him always standing and in perpetual motion \u2014 no desk to sit behind, no chair to sit on \u2014 surrounded at all times by graphics, data and video.Netflix ordered 32 episodes of the series, which will be released in cycles of six to eight weekly episodes. Even now, in the days before its first episodes are released, Minhaj was still deciding whether one long monologue was enough content for an entire show or if viewers would also want another shorter, less substantive segment (a \u201cwine pairing\u201d to go with their \u201csteak,\u201d as he put it).Minhaj\u2019s comedy peers believe that he has as good a shot as anyone at finding a new approach to this well-worn genre. But no one is in denial about the challenges he faces, either.\u201cYou never know what\u2019s going to hit and what\u2019s not going to,\u201d Jon Stewart said, but when it came to Minhaj, \u201cI\u2019d buy that raffle ticket any day of the week.\u201dThough other recent shows with promising hosts had been short-lived, Stewart said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it says anything about the talent of the individuals. If you told me, \u2018I\u2019m going to let Jordan Klepper or Robin Thede or Michelle Wolf do what they do,\u2019 I\u2019d be like, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s a smart choice.\u2019\u201dHe added, \u201cI hate to see things get pulled before they\u2019ve fully developed their voice and figured out who they are, and I thought they all showed a worthiness to continue. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m not a network executive.\u201dLarry Wilmore, the longtime \u201cDaily Show\u201d correspondent and former \u201cNightly Show\u201d host, said he wondered if the audiences for these comedy shows had already made their choices and their viewing habits were fixed in place.\u201cThere is just a lot of that type of content out there,\u201d Wilmore said. \u201cThere are already trusted outlets for it. They\u2019re home cooking for a lot of people.\u201dIn an oversaturated market, Wilmore said, audiences would be won not by pioneering formats but memorable personalities, and he certainly considered Minhaj to be such a performer.\u201cThe people who are coming to his shows are doing it in exhilaration \u2014 \u2018Finally, somebody like us is doing this,\u2019\u201d he said of Minhaj. \u201cI think that\u2019s very meaningful.\u201dRobin Thede, the former \u201cNightly Show\u201d head writer and host of \u201cThe Rundown,\u201d said that there was still ample room for a show that did not focus on the day-in, day-out spectacle of the Trump presidency. \u201cI think people are tired of hearing about Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re for Trump or against Trump, everyone\u2019s exhausted.\u201dAchieving diversity in the field is still a crucial goal, Thede said: \u201cAt the end of the day, there\u2019s still at least three men who were born with the name James who host late-night shows.\u201dBut broadcasters also have to recognize the long-term commitments required to make these programs viable.She added, \u201cAny talk show needs a couple years to find their voice but a lot of places can\u2019t afford that luxury. It\u2019s all niche, really.\u201dTo many viewers, the very idea of a comedy show drawn from news and events happening right this moment seems to contradict the fundamental proposition that streaming platforms are offering.\u201cThe whole point is that they liberated us from appointments,\u201d Noah said. \u201cIt\u2019s like McDonald\u2019s saying, \u2018Hey, would you like to wait 30 minutes for your food?\u2019\u201dNetflix still aspires to have its own breakthrough topical comedy series. \u201cWe\u2019d like to aspire to be best in class in programming, in every category,\u201d Bajaria said. With a sardonic chuckle, she added, \u201cAnd we do like a challenge.\u201dBut she acknowledged there were still challenges in selling Netflix viewers on these shows. \u201cWe\u2019ve spent all this time saying, \u2018Come at any point to the platform, watch whenever you want,\u2019\u201d Bajaria said. \u201cIn this category, we\u2019re saying there\u2019s a timeliness and trying to drive viewers on a weekly basis, which is different.\u201dBut Bajaria said each series is its own proposition. In the case of \u201cThe Break With Michelle Wolf,\u201d she said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of factors that we take into consideration, obviously, when we\u2019re not renewing a series. It didn\u2019t find as large of an audience as we would have hoped. She\u2019s very talented and we hope she felt really supported, making the show she wanted to make.\u201d (Wolf declined to comment for this article.)Netflix is hoping that Minhaj\u2019s ethnicity and his personal compass for news stories will help him reach viewers in the other 190 or so countries outside the United States where it is offered, and it plans to promote the show heavily on YouTube and social media.The success of \u201cPatriot Act,\u201d Bajaria said, would be measured by its viewership figures (which Netflix doesn\u2019t make public) as well as its ability to insinuate itself into the zeitgeist (which no one has yet figured out how to quantify).\u201cDo you have something to say?\u201d she said. \u201cDo you have a fresh way to say this? We really think Hasan\u2019s P.O.V. and his take on things can cut through.\u201dA short time after the \u201cpre-viz\u201d meeting, Minhaj was in his office at \u201cPatriot Act,\u201d his Air Jordans propped up on his desk near a Mike Bibby bobblehead. On a dry-erase board in front of him was a rough outline for an episode he hoped to perform about Saudi Arabia and its crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Attached to a corkboard behind him were notecards with other topics for future exploration: \u201cAmazon and antitrust\u201d; \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d; \u201cMyanmar/Rohingya.\u201dHe had to make his choices shrewdly: every segment he commits to means months of work for his news research, writing and graphics departments, a staff of about 74 people total.Minhaj said he was determined that \u201cPatriot Act\u201d not come out of the gate looking like \u201cthis open mic that Netflix is paying for as we figure it out.\u201d He could still remember the day he learned that Wolf\u2019s and McHale\u2019s shows were both canceled and how it ratcheted up the pressure on his project.As he recalled it, \u201cPrashanth walked into my office and he could see that I was definitely stressed. He goes, \u2018Remember, this is how you felt during the correspondents dinner.\u2019 It\u2019s this massive question mark \u2014 what is going to happen?\u201dAt his test show a few weeks later, in a rare moment when he wasn\u2019t feverishly delivering his affirmative action monologue or guzzling down gulps of water when the camera wasn\u2019t on him, Minhaj paused to reflect on a joke he had told earlier.He\u2019d played a series of clips from interviews with Edward Blum, the conservative activist, in which he variously claimed that Harvard had a precise quota of 17, 19 or 15 percent for Asians in its incoming freshman class.After the videos, Minhaj mocked Blum, telling him he should have studied harder at Kumon, the boot-camp education franchise that is especially popular with Asian immigrant families.The line had got some laughter, and Minhaj was proud of that. He told the audience, \u201cAll the writers were like, \u2018I don\u2019t know if the Kumon joke is going to hit. It\u2019s, like, so nerdy.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Trust me \u2014 it\u2019s going to hit.\u2019\u201dAnd he was right. It was just one choice, but it was his choice and he was happy with it.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Will TV Change the Comedy Cellar? Comics Are About to Find Out", "Date": "2018-10-28", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byOn ComedyAs Hurricane Florence headed toward the Eastern Seaboard in September, Ted Tremper, the showrunner for \u201cThis Week at the Comedy Cellar,\u201d realized he had a problem, and it wasn\u2019t damage from the storm. He needed jokes.It was the final day of shooting for the test show, and while he had hours of footage of comics weighing in on eight categories (Trump, #MeToo, Colin Kaepernick, etc.), he had no punch lines about Florence.As a former producer of \u201cThe Daily Show With Trevor Noah,\u201d he knew humorous takes on the news needed to stay current. But there was another issue. Some forecasts were suggesting Florence could be catastrophic. As Tremper explained before the first sets of the night, \u201cThe challenge is: How do we comment on this without doing a joke in poor taste?\u201dThat\u2019s probably not the last time he will have to answer the question of how to successfully shift the context of jokes from the Comedy Cellar, the premier club in New York, to national television. The new show, which made its debut Friday night on Comedy Central, arrives at a critical moment for the Cellar, which has become the subject of controversy just as it tries to expand its empire.The notoriety has obscured the club\u2019s bid to raise its national profile this year. Based in Greenwich Village since 1982, it opened a branch in Las Vegas, and after a rocky start that included a brief shutdown, it now has an impressive lineup of comics, including many of the names from the New York club.The new television series is an even bolder move by the Cellar\u2019s owner, Noam Dworman, who is not content to stand pat even though his space packs in crowds every night. As dominant as the Cellar is in the New York club scene right now, it\u2019s a fiercely competitive business where reputations rise and fall. The storied Comic Strip Live on the Upper East Side was once the center of the stand-up world, and it now can have trouble attracting audiences.At the same time, streaming services built on the idea that consumers can watch what they want when they want are having trouble figuring out how to make topical comedy work. (See Michelle Wolf, a Cellar comic whose Netflix show was canceled after a short run.) \u201cThis Week at the Comedy Cellar\u201d is making a bet on jokes in comedy clubs as the next frontier in topical humor.If the show does well, it would change not just the landscape of late-night television, but also the Cellar itself. Cameras certainly shift the atmosphere in the room, but they also encourage comics to do more newsy material to get on the air. The producers are adamant that they do not tell comics what to say, and while there is some room for evergreen jokes, the focus here is on what is happening now.Dworman said this will make the club better. \u201cThe comedians are going to get the hang of it, and it\u2019s going to really inspire some great new material,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the pilot, Ryan Hamilton, who doesn\u2019t normally do political stuff, came up with some\u201d that he used for weeks afterward.\u201cMy mandate is to present the most honest representation of the comics as I can,\u201d Tremper said. Does that include discussion of Louis C. K.? He said yes \u2014 and there was one allusion to him in the premiere in a joke by Dan Naturman. The episode was dense with punch lines from young stand-ups, including timely ones about Megyn Kelly\u2019s show getting canceled after she questioned what was wrong with blackface. \u201cIt bummed me out because I was planning on going as Bill Cosby for Halloween,\u201d said the comic Sam Morril. \u201cBecause that\u2019s how you make blackface the second most offensive part of your costume.\u201dOne of Tremper\u2019s partners, Michael Hirschorn, said the show would portray a wide array of views, and the pilot and test runs included a much younger and diverse collection of comics than what you saw on \u201cTough Crowd.\u201d (While the Cellar is famous for celebrity drop-ins like Kevin Hart and Dave Chappelle, no A-listers appeared on the premiere episode.) When asked how the politics of the Cellar would work on cable, Mr. Hirschorn replied: \u201cI\u2019m comfortable with the level of wokeness here.\u201d Then he laughed.Sitting in a booth at the Village Underground next to a monitor and a guy transcribing every joke told onstage, Hirschorn and Tremper looked tired. They had been shooting film and editing through the night, and Tremper had sneaked in a quick nap.After a few acts, the stand-up Josh Gondelman did some material about being on Twitter in bed at night and getting angry while his wife read. The producers stared ahead, listening, but then became more visibly alert when Gondelman started discussing President Trump\u2019s reference to Hurricane Florence as \u201ctremendously big and tremendously wet.\u201dAfter pointing out that this sounded like a lyric from an AC/DC song, Gondelman asked: \u201cIs there one thing he can talk about without sounding like he wanted to have sex with it?\u201dHirschorn looked at Tremper and smiled. \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d he said. \u201cWe needed that.\u201dAdvertisement"}

Both cite the importance of laughter in their marriage. \u201cWe\u2019ve evolved together,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s been our blessing. We don\u2019t have children so our marriage is our whole family.\u201dThe couple married April 3, 1999, at the Austin, Tex., home of the actress Sandra Bullock, Ms. Bullock-Prado\u2019s older sister. At the time, the house was undergoing renovations. Several hours before the wedding, Sandra Bullock was stapling fabric to an unfinished balcony, which later held a string quartet. Scaffolding and a tent were placed over the unfinished pool area. About 50 guests sat at two elongated tables, with a lake view as their backdrop.The couple met in January 1997 when both were living in Los Angeles. \u201cI was the development person under my sister\u2019s production company,\u201d said Ms. Bullock-Prado, who was 27 at the time. \u201cWe were doing a table reading of \u201cHope Floats.\u201d Ray walked in with a producer friend, and my heart dropped into my stomach. I felt sick. It was one of those lightning bolts, love-at-first-sight moments.\u201dMs. Bullock-Prado had been living with a boyfriend at the time, so she didn\u2019t think much would come of that first meeting. A week later, however, they found themselves on the same flight, but in different rows, traveling to Austin to scout locations. \u201cWe only spoke when we got off the plane,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tried to find something we could connect on, which was college. I asked where he went. He said, Dartmouth. We knew people in common. Once we started talking we couldn\u2019t stop. We had the same quirks and interests. Everything clicked.\u201dMs. Bullock-Prado thought Mr. Prado was handsome and \u201cthe coolest guy\u201d she\u2019d ever met, and broke off her relationship with the man she had been living with for several months. \u201cIt was nice but it wasn\u2019t \u2018it.\u2019 I had no way of knowing what \u2018it\u2019 was until \u2018it\u2019 walked in the door, which was Ray.\u201dThey became a couple immediately, and within a month were living together. Mr. Prado proposed a year later. \u201cWe went to one of those old-school Italian restaurants that Sinatra would have gone to and told everyone we just got engaged,\u201d she said. Because Ms. Bullock-Prado\u2019s mother was ill, wedding plans moved quickly. Five months after their engagement they were married.He\u2019s supportive and that\u2019s worked in our relationship. We live our own best creative lives with each other, and with each other\u2019s support. I wouldn\u2019t be a pastry chef or an author, and we wouldn\u2019t be living in Vermont if he hadn\u2019t shown me I\u2019m capable.I\u2019ve learned that at Ray\u2019s core, he is sensitive and kind. He\u2019s become self-aware and sensitive to how people are around him. He\u2019s expressive and direct, and that can be intimidating, so he\u2019s learned to be more nuanced. I can\u2019t spend a minute without screaming my head off, but he\u2019s shown me patience and understanding that\u2019s been eye-opening.We are in a mixed marriage. He\u2019s Latino, Native American and Asian. He\u2019s lived a totally different experience than me. So I\u2019ve learned to be quiet and listen and watch and learn. I wasn\u2019t able to understand in the beginning. Now I can, and seeing some of the things he\u2019s had to go through is enlightening. I\u2019ve also learned to just be there for him, and that we are a team.People evolve in marriages; we\u2019ve evolved together. That\u2019s been our blessing. We don\u2019t have children so our marriage is our whole family.We\u2019ve had tough patches. Twenty years is a long time. If you hold onto resentment you\u2019re not having a fulfilling relationship. We decided to say we are going to be rigorously honest about everything, and kind. That has worked tremendously well. When we decided our main focus was to have a happy marriage and make each other happy, everything got fantastic. We got out of these bad spots by saying we have to focus on each other.She\u2019s a true detector of good and evil. She\u2019s my moral compass. She reminds me of Wonder Woman. I can always count on her for the correct ethical take on something.I grew up with this idea that men are men, and women are women. That we need our alone time, and we don\u2019t have to share everything. That kind of thinking was destroying our marriage. It took a lot of listening and understanding that a true relationship isn\u2019t that way. I had to realize we\u2019re in this together. Once I became unguarded our life and everything else opened up.Being an artist is an uncertain life. I have a dark perfectionism. She helped me see the happy mistakes that can make this existence more fulfilling and to see the importance of sticking with things.We had a lot of ups and downs. But if it\u2019s a chart, we are constantly moving up, even though there are dips along the way. The longer we\u2019ve been together the better things have gotten. We are lucky because we\u2019ve grown with each other. We are not the same people we were five or 10 years ago. That feels unique to me.We help each other believe in ourselves, which is sexy. We have a partnership where someone believes in you. That\u2019s gotten us through the good and bad times.We both work at home, so everyday at 3 or 4, we have a cappuccino and a pastry she\u2019s made. I\u2019ve become the test kitchen. It grounds us together and helps me stay organized. It\u2019s a loving, fun way to see each other in the afternoon.We felt this connection when we first met. The hard thing is to remember that feeling. She gives my life meaning, more so as we get older together.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Farewell, FilmStruck: A Bittersweet Guide to the Movies to Catch Before It\u2019s Gone", "Date": "2018-10-29", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byFilmStruck has never been simply a repository of classics from the Criterion Collection and the TCM archive, and it hasn\u2019t relied on a janky algorithm to anticipate what viewers want. The service is thoughtfully curated, making it possible to create and screen your own personal film festivals at home and put the work of certain directors, actors and movements in context.When I was a misfit movie-mad kid from Jersey, my wonderful aunt Peggy would invite me to \u201cthe city\u201d and take me to museums and cinemas. With her, at the MoMA bookshop in 1972, when I was 12, I bought my first hardcover movie book: a biography of the French renegade filmmaker Jean Vigo. His pictures, only four in all, anarchic and tender, subversive and romantic, had not yet been seen by me. They were rarely shown in my neck of the woods. So I just read about them, obsessively.Then a library a few towns away announced a screening of \u201cZero For Conduct,\u201d and I begged my dad to take me. We got there and learned the print was too damaged to run; another film was substituted. I burst into tears. Jeez, my poor dad.I\u2019ve been aiming to be an Orson Welles completist. Wish me luck: So much went unfinished in the director\u2019s career, and so many of his films were cut and cut again in wildly different ways, that much of his art was left in \u201cIs this what he wanted?\u201d fragments.In my teens and twenties, I was the kind of film buff who haunted repertory theaters, worked at a video store and obsessively watched Turner Classic Movies. But even I didn\u2019t hear about Vera Chytilova\u2019s social satire \u201cDaisies\u201d until 2012, when the Criterion Collection put it on DVD as part of its \u201cPearls of the Czech New Wave\u201d box set.I came to Robert Bresson in my mid-30s, late (for now) in my cinematic education. But maybe it was better that way. How wonderful to discover as an adult, and on one\u2019s own, such a singular and mature vision! The experience changed my understanding of cinema, which I hadn\u2019t thought possible. And knowing Bresson\u2019s work felt like knowing a sacred name that only the initiates of some secret order are permitted to pronounce: To meet a fellow admirer was to meet someone who understood something essential, and not only about film.I was 11 years old the first time I saw Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut\u2019s \u201cDay For Night.\u201d It was airing late one night on A&E, which once stood for \u201cArts & Entertainment,\u201d and was programmed accordingly (not that \u201cStorage Wars\u201d isn\u2019t art). I recognized the title from Roger Ebert\u2019s \u201cMovie Home Companion\u201d; he had given it four stars and called it \u201cnot only the best movie ever made about the movies\u201d but \u201calso a great entertainment.\u201dI\u2019m going to miss how easy it was to discover on FilmStruck the movies I had previously only read about. Alongside the most recognizable names in international and independent cinema were lesser-known gems from around the world and from our own backyard, as is the case with Robert M. Young\u2019s \u201cAlambrista!\u201dLike many before me, I first discovered the 1987 dark comedy \u201cWithnail and I\u201d back in the VHS days, after hearing countless people mimicking Richard E. Grant\u2019s gloriously slurred belligerence. (\u201cWe want the finest wines available to humanity! We want them here and we want them now!\u201d) The role of Withnail \u2014 a flamboyant alcoholic and failing actor \u2014 launched Grant\u2019s career, and it\u2019s still a knockout.I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve seen \u201cNaked\u201d more than three times. And yet, \u201cNaked\u201d is one of my favorite films. How can both statements be true? Because like Johnny, the human vortex of misanthropy at the heart of this scathing, haunting film from Mike Leigh, \u201cNaked\u201d arrives unexpectedly and does enough psychic damage to mark you for life.Played by David Thewlis in his breakout role, Johnny is a shuffling, shaggy-haired native of Manchester, now down-and-out in London after fleeing the consequences of the sexual assault that opens the film. (The merciless tone is established from the start.) With his cruel intelligence, dizzying monologues and trademark black trench coat, he upends the lives of old friends, acquaintances and total strangers alike.The first time I experienced \u201cIn the Mood for Love,\u201d I was a graduate student in cinema studies several years ago. I believe it was in my class on film form and style, one of our required courses. At the time, I considered it stunning, if a bit slow for my tastes.The 26-minute documentary \u201cForza Bastia 78\u201d may not immediately catch your eye on FilmStruck, but it is a delightful U.F.O. in the career of Jacques Tati, the French filmmaker famous for such droll comedies as \u201cMon Oncle.\u201dIn April 1978, Tati flew to Corsica to cover the first leg of the UEFA Cup Final, which pitted the scrappy Bastia team against the much larger, much more powerful Dutch club PSV Eindhoven. I was a kid living in Corsica an hour from Bastia back then, and I distinctly remember our soccer fever.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "Disney\u2019s TV Division Makes Room for Fox Executives", "Date": "2018-10-08", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byPeter Rice, the president of 21st Century Fox, will become the chairman of Walt Disney Television. In that role, Mr. Rice will oversee most of Disney\u2019s vast television properties \u2014 including ABC, FX and National Geographic \u2014 with the notable exception of ESPN.Dana Walden, a co-chief executive of the Fox Television Group, will become the chairwoman of Disney Television studios and ABC Entertainment. With the new appointment, Ms. Walden will run ABC, Freeform, local stations and the combined companies\u2019 giant new television studio.John Landgraf will remain the head of the FX cable network, the home of \u201cAtlanta\u201d and \u201cAmerican Horror Story,\u201d and its studio. Gary Knell, the head of National Geographic, will also continue in his role.To make way for the incoming team, Ben Sherwood, the current head of television at ABC and Disney, will leave the company once the deal is closed. Most of Disney\u2019s other key TV executives \u2014 including Channing Dungey, the president of ABC Entertainment; Tom Ascheim, who runs Freeform; James Goldston, the president of ABC News; and Patrick Moran, the head of ABC Studios \u2014 will stay in their positions with one key difference: They will be reporting to new bosses.Disney\u2019s new executives will have their work cut out for them, with ABC facing significant challenges. The one major broadcast network that does not have rights to the National Football League, ABC has finished in last place for three consecutive seasons in the ratings. And three weeks into the 2018-19 season, it has shown no sign of improvement, with Nielsen numbers having plunged more than 30 percent for a hit ABC series of recent vintage, \u201cThe Good Doctor,\u201d as well as for its aging reality franchise \u201cDancing With the Stars.\u201dThe executives who join Disney after years at Fox will find themselves in a corporate environment that is much different from what they are used to. Fox, controlled by the family of Rupert Murdoch, gives its executives a lot of free rein. Disney\u2019s culture is more hierarchical, with clear lines of command that lead to one man: the company\u2019s hands-on chief executive, Robert A. Iger.\u201cThe strength of 21st Century Fox\u2019s first-class management talent has always been a compelling part of this opportunity for us,\u201d Mr. Iger said in a statement.In his own statement, Mr. Rice said: \u201cI love making television and have been fortunate to work with incredibly talented executives and storytellers. Disney is the world\u2019s pre-eminent creative company, and I look forward to working for Bob, and with his exceptional leadership team, to build on that amazing legacy.\u201dShareholders for Disney and Fox approved the combination of Disney and Fox in July. Although a major reason for the deal was to ensure that Disney would thrive in an industry that is becoming more dependent on streaming, the Monday announcement did not mention the role that the new executive team will play in Hulu. After its acquisition of much of Fox is approved, Disney will become the majority owner of the streaming service.Advertisement"}
{"Headline": "DealBook Briefing: Tech and Trade Woes Keep Dragging on the Markets", "Date": "2018-10-30", "News": "AdvertisementSupported byBloomberg reports that the administration could announce the levies by early December, to take effect by early February. (The plan is said to be a backup, in case a meeting next month between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China doesn\u2019t yield results.) The tariffs could cover about $257 billion worth of goods \u2014 including popular items like iPhones and Nike sneakers.The decision, which came after the American chip maker Micron accused Jinhua of intellectual property theft, could be a crippling blow to the Chinese company. (And it drew comparisons to the Trump administration\u2019s harsh actions against ZTE earlier this year.) The penalties will delay China\u2019s effort to establish a homegrown chip industry that doesn\u2019t rely on American parts.Behind that volatility were continuing investor concerns that tech stocks are overvalued. Amazon, for instance, fell 6.3 percent yesterday, while Netflix dropped 5 percent, and shares in both are down over 20 percent this month. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.6 percent on Monday, and is off 13 percent from its August high.Trade fears also weighed on stocks, after a report that President Trump may impose tariffs on all remaining imports from China, raising fears about increasing costs for American businesses and consumers.U.S. markets are looking stronger this morning, however, with futures for major indexes up.In the wake of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, social media is coming under close scrutiny. So far, its progress is found wanting.More from Sheera Frenkel, Mike Isaac and Kate Conger:Over the last 10 years, Silicon Valley\u2019s social media companies have expanded their reach and influence to the furthest corners of the world.

The new charge, scheduled to go into effect in 2020, would apply only to organizations with global revenue of at least 500 million pounds, or about $640 million. The government will ask for 2 percent of revenue the companies generate in Britain. Mr. Hammond said the plan could eventually raise as much as \u00a3400 million annually.But the tech industry is unimpressed.

{"Headline": "Review: Netflix\u2019s \u2018Wanderlust\u2019 Is an Experiment in Fidelity", "Date": "2018-10-19", "News": "AdvertisementSupported by\u201cWanderlust\u201d begins with Joy, the British therapist played by Toni Collette, getting back on the bike, literally and figuratively. Out of commission after an accident that left her with a broken hip, she straps on an industrial-grade helmet and pedals slowly down the street, even though she\u2019s still having trouble walking.At about the same time, she tries restarting another activity, sex with her schoolteacher husband, Alan (Steven Mackintosh). This doesn\u2019t go as well. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to have sex with me,\u201d he says, and Joy\u2019s silent reaction \u2014 Ms. Collette\u2019s darting eyes signaling sheepishness, guilt and relief \u2014 leaves no doubt that he\u2019s right.Joy and Alan quickly work out their frustrations, he with his fellow teacher, Claire (Zawe Ashton), and she with a cop from her hydrotherapy class (William Ash of \u201cThe Tunnel\u201d), and just as quickly confess to each other. Joy, a problem solver, proposes that they continue having sex with others while maintaining their marriage. Alan offers up some passive-aggressive evasions, but he\u2019s into it, too, if not as determinedly as Joy.\u201cIt\u2019s the difference between a snack and a meal,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe.\u201dBut that\u2019s not where \u201cWanderlust\u201d is going. Payne seems to be conducting his own experiment: to see how closely he can mimic the shallow charms of a Richard Curtis rom-com. He does a good job over all, demonstrating the same ability to jump between labored comic business and somber melodrama, often within a scene; the same willingness to make his characters look ridiculous; the same habit of getting out of a bland or nonsensical scene by ending on a non sequitur punch line; the same reliance on snippets of pop music to pump up emotion.Payne is artsier, though, which means a higher level of literary name-dropping \u2014 Joy and Alan\u2019s 16-year-old son, Tom (Joe Hurst), courts his high school crush using tickets to a Zadie Smith reading \u2014 and a more insistent focus on glum psychology and dark consequences.Joy\u2019s idea works well at first, magically rekindling her and Alan\u2019s interest in each other. And it looks like the series will explore the question of whether they can happily maintain both their marriage and their affairs, especially Alan\u2019s increasingly intimate attachment to Claire. At the same time, in an intricate but not very interesting counterpoint, we see the fumbling beginnings of relationships for their three children and the depressing impasses reached by several of Joy\u2019s therapeutic clients.Then along comes a stunt episode \u2014 an entire hour devoted to a session between Joy and her own therapist, played by Sophie Okonedo, playing out in something close to real time. Payne changes the rules on us, taking a theme of debilitating grief that had been hinted at and making it the central term of his equation \u2014 \u201cDeath, Actually.\u201d (It\u2019s also a narrative cheat that allows Payne to arrange his ending the way he wants it, regardless of how Joy\u2019s and Alan\u2019s liaisons would be likely to play out in real life.)If you\u2019ve reached that point, you might as well hold on to see whether Joy and Alan can ride it out. Before that, the performances and Payne\u2019s skill with dialogue have their rewards, though they\u2019re attenuated \u2014 Payne doesn\u2019t have the conviction of a true schlockmeister, and he doesn\u2019t deliver the boffo laughs and tears of a Curtis film.Ashton, who was funny as the uptight assistant of Jason Isaacs\u2019s detective in \u201cCase Histories,\u201d is clever and touching here as Claire, who surprises herself (and the audience) by falling for Alan. Isis Hainsworth of \u201cHarlots\u201d is good as the quiet best friend of Joy and Alan\u2019s son.For her part, Collette sails through the six hours, easily carrying off the therapy episode and making the good moments Payne gives her delightful, like Joy\u2019s karaoke rendition of \u201cHere Comes the Rain Again\u201d or the happiness on her face when she\u2019s standing alone in a club listening to the band. Collette makes us believe in Joy; if only Payne had made us care.Advertisement"}

{"Headline": "33 Unique Treats From All Around the World", "Date": "2018-10-24", "News": "Nations have flags and anthems \u2014 but they also have their defining treats. Here are some candies that capture the spirit of the countries they come from.We need to hide this paragraph.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.Trade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nIt might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. Called Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios.

The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk.

It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day.

The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Worldwide, nearly 70 percent of cocoa beans come from Africa, and Ghana is the second-largest producer in the world, with a G.D.P. that\u2019s partly dependent on cocoa export. Even so, Ghana has few producers of actual confections. (The entire African continent consumes only about 4 percent of the world\u2019s cocoa beans.) Cocoa Processing Company Limited in Tema is one of them. Every year, the company says it processes 65,000 metric tons of cocoa beans, but it also has a line of chocolates and candy bars, including its lemon-flavored Akuafo Bar. Akuafo means farmers, and it\u2019s meant to be \u2018\u2018a dedication to farmers whose hard work and sweat sustain the Ghanaian economy.\u2019\u2019Of all the candies in the world, Chupa Chups might have the most famous designer. In 1969, Enric Bernat, the Spanish businessman behind the lollipop brand, asked his friend Salvador Dal\u00ed to create the well-known logo. Though it has had some tweaks since then, that daisy-shaped logo \u2014 and the fact that it\u2019s placed at the top of the pop \u2014 remains, as does the name, which translates to something like \u2018\u2018sucky suck.\u2019\u2019 Since they were first released in the 1950s, the candies have become available in\u00a0177 countries and even made it to outer space in 1994, when Russian astronauts brought them to the Mir\u00a0space station. Today, the\u00a0best-selling flavors are strawberry and cola, which happen to be two of the\u00a0original five, along with mint, lemon and orange.It might seem counterintuitive to make candy from a fruit that the writer Richard Sterling said smelled like \u2018\u2018pig-[expletive], turpentine and onions, garnished with a gym sock.\u2019\u2019 The taste of the massive, spiky fruit is also bizarre \u2014 a custardy, sweet flavor with a savory vibe \u2014 often described as whipped cream with a hint of garlic or, as the naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace wrote, \u2018\u2018occasional wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-cheese, onion-sauce, sherry-wine and other incongruous dishes.\u2019\u2019 Nonetheless, Durian candy is a coveted souvenir from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Though it has\u00a0its fans, durian candy has also been\u00a0the subject of videos like \u2018\u2018Trying the\u00a0Worst Candy Ever!\u2019\u2019 and\u00a0\u2018\u2018Durian Candy Reaction.\u2019\u2019 In 1922, a married candy maker named Luisa Spagnoli decided she needed to do something with the leftover nuts at her chocolate factory. She put a whole hazelnut atop some milk chocolate whipped with chopped nuts and covered it in dark chocolate. The result looked like a fist, so she gave it the name cazzotto, or punch. But her lover, the son of her business partner who was 10 years her junior, decided that a box of punches didn\u2019t really make a romantic gift. The two renamed it bacio, or kiss, in 1924. Since the 1930s, each piece has come wrapped in words from artists, writers and philosophers, supposedly a nod to the notes the\u00a0two lovers would secretly pass each\u00a0other.\nCalled Turkish delight in the Western world, this gummy-jelly candy covered in confectioners\u2019 sugar has a local name that derives from a phrase meaning \u2018\u2018comfort of the throat.\u2019\u2019 Some say it was originally created for a sultan\u2019s harem, but the modern version of the treat is commonly attributed to Bekir Effendi, a confectioner who opened his shop, Haci Bekir, near the spice bazaar in Istanbul in the late 1700s. Generations later, Effendi\u2019s relatives are still running the company. Lokum picked up the nickname Turkish delight when it reached Britain in the middle of the 19th century and, 100 years later, made a cameo in the C.\u2009S. Lewis classic \u2018\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe.\u2019\u2019 While it was traditionally made with just sugar and molasses or honey, Haci Bekir\u2019s versions can feature ingredients like pistachio and pomegranate.These chocolate-covered caramels get their name from the celebrity trivia on their wrappers \u2014 quite literally, fan tales. They were first created in the 1930s to cash in on movie-star mania not long after the \u2018\u2018talkies\u2019\u2019 came to Australia. Today, the candy is owned by Nestl\u00e9, and its team of trivia writers digs up factoids on celebrities from Australia and around the world. Here\u2019s a snippet from a wrapper: \u2018\u2018Born in New South Wales in 1939, he held a job as a painter working on the Sydney Harbour Bridge before rising to fame in the early 1970s after he did a comical interview on \u2018A Current Affair.\u2019 He later became a worldwide success with his performance in \u2018Crocodile Dundee\u2019 (1986), which he co-wrote.\u2019\u2019 Answer: Paul Hogan. White Rabbit candy is famous in China \u2014 Premier Zhou Enlai gave Richard Nixon a bag during his historic visit in 1972 \u2014 but the wrapper hasn\u2019t always featured the well-known rabbit. The soft, vanilla-and-milk-flavored candy was reportedly first introduced in 1943 with a Mickey Mouse figure on the packaging, but by the late \u201950s, candy companies were being nationalized, and Western imagery was a political no-go. In its 75-year history, the candy has become popular around the world. In 2008, when an incident involving melamine-tainted milk shook China, production shut down for several months to ensure the candy was safe to eat, though in Singapore, consumers were told they could eat 47 pieces daily before experiencing ill effects. Ten years later, the company makes the candies with only imported milk powder from New Zealand.This raw-mango-flavored candy has\u00a0a surprise in the middle: powdered spices that the maker calls the \u2018\u2018masala bomb.\u2019\u2019 (In India, raw mangoes are often eaten with tangy spices.) Though the candies have been a big seller since they were introduced in 2015, even reportedly tying a sales record Coke set when it introduced Coke Zero to the Indian\u00a0market, the treat might have a harder time in the United States. While the hard-candy exterior has a\u00a0sweet flavor, the bomb has a sulfur taste that may be a bit too close to rotten eggs for the American palate.Born in a San Francisco licorice factory in the 1950s, the twists have been the favorite of moviegoers and kids who like to bite off the ends and make a straw for more than half a century. Thanks to their ubiquitous presence, and the East Coast/West Coast feud that has developed between their fans and Twizzlers enthusiasts, they\u2019ve become a cultural hot button, showing up in TV shows like \u2018\u2018Gilmore Girls,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018The Big Bang Theory,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018True Blood,\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018Last Week Tonight With John Oliver\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Weeds.\u2019\u2019 In an episode of \u2018\u2018Parks and Recreation,\u2019\u2019 when the main character, Leslie Knope, is trying to smooth over relations with her fianc\u00e9\u2019s dad, she offers him a big bowl of Red Vines. Response? \u2018\u2018We\u2019re a Twizzlers family.\u2019\u2019The brigadeiro, a fudge truffle, is a classic in Brazil and frequently served at parties. The story goes that the treat gets its name from Brig. Gen. Eduardo Gomes, a candidate in the 1945 presidential election. The general didn\u2019t win the presidency, but his legacy lives on in the chocolaty confection. To create your own, make fudge balls by combining sweetened cocoa powder, condensed milk and butter, then top with sugar or sprinkles. Or take inspiration from the hipster versions you can find from New York to Brazil that include pistachios, coconut or matcha.A beloved candy bar somewhat like a Kit Kat, the Coffee Crisp is manufactured at a Nestl\u00e9 factory in Toronto and isn\u2019t distributed anywhere outside the country, much to the chagrin of its rabid American fans. Back in 2000, a Milwaukee man named John Flaig created a petition asking the company to bring the candy bar to the United States. Six years later, Nestl\u00e9 relented and started selling it south of the border, but with a different wrapper. (They also pulled the \u2018\u2018nice, light snack\u2019\u2019 tagline.) But sadly, it didn\u2019t last: These days Americans who want one have to cross the border.Savoy, the original candy company behind Cri Cri, was founded by four immigrants in a Caracas garage in 1941. One of them, John Miller, had brought a chocolate-making machine with him from Scotland, and they used it to create the Savoy chocolate bar. Almost 30 years later, the company created a puffed-rice version. In 1980, that candy bar got its own name, Cri Cri, thanks to a formula the founders picked up by talking to friends, neighbors and kids: The name needed to be short and easy to pronounce. Today Savoy is one of the leading candy companies in Venezuela, and its products are often given in December during Amigo Secreto, which is essentially the Venezuelan version of Secret Santa. Super Hiper \u00c1cido (S.H.A.) is exactly as its name implies: sour. As in, maybe the most sour thing you\u2019ve ever put in your mouth. Confiteca, the Ecuadorean company behind it, designed it for the extreme palates of Gen Z candy lovers. To make sure\u00a0the sour flavor was enough of a\u00a0challenge, Confiteca developed its own sour scale and declared that every Super Hiper \u00c1cido product the company put on the market has to hit at least 90 out of 100. The S.H.A. brand of products now makes up about 42 percent of Confiteca\u2019s exports and is popular in Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, United Arab Emirates, Panama and Israel.A Bon o Bon is a milk-chocolate shell over a crisp wafer filled with a flavored cream. Every day, factories in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil produce 3,000 of the sweet treats every minute, and 70 percent of production is exported throughout the world. In 1989, the brand helped establish Sweetness Week in Argentina, a clever marketing campaign that encourages candy lovers to exchange confections for kisses. It worked: Candy sales in Argentina rise about 20 percent for a week every July. The candy\u2019s tagline? \u2018\u2018Where there is emotion, there is a Bon o Bon.\u2019\u2019What Zuckerlwerkstatt calls rock candy is about as far from the American version as it gets. The round, smooth confections look more like millefiori glass designs from Venice than something you should eat: They include beautiful, tiny sugar depictions of everything from fruit to\u00a0slogans to company logos. An Austrian couple, Maria Scholz and Chris Mayer, were on vacation in Sweden when they stumbled on\u00a0a candy factory and fell\u00a0in love with candy making. Back home, they\u00a0sought out artisans who\u00a0knew the old Austrian way of\u00a0making hard candy by hand. In\u00a02013, the couple opened a manufacturing facility in Vienna, producing beautiful candies with as\u00a0many as 80 layers using only\u00a0three tools: scissors, spatulas and their bare hands. If biting the head off a gummy bear\u00a0is an odd sensation, consider the act of sinking your teeth into the gummy, powdered, sugarcoated jelly baby, a wee candy shaped like an infant. According to lore, what a 19th-century candy maker meant to be a jelly bean ended up looking more like a baby, so a confectioner called them unclaimed babies \u2014 like the ones frequently left on church steps in the era. In 1918, in a nod to the Armistice, Bassett\u2019s of Sheffield sold them under the name Peace Babies, and in 1953 they were rebranded as Jelly Babies. Part of their fame comes from celebrity fans: Tom Baker\u2019s Doctor Who carried them in his pockets, and George Harrison reportedly liked the candy, which resulted in the Beatles being pelted with them. Pastillas are popular milk-based candies, originally from San Miguel in the Philippines. The traditional recipe combines the milk of the carabao, the water buffalo that serves as the country\u2019s national animal, with powdered milk and sugar, and calls for the resulting soft candy to be rolled into small logs and covered in paper wrappers. In the Bulacan region, the wrappers, called pabalat, have become a bit of an art form with cut-paper designs. Pastillas are a celebratory candy and are often given for birthdays and weddings.Known for its zebra-striped wrapper, TomTom is a bit of a threefer, a hard candy with menthol that provides a hit of sugar, fresher breath and, according to its tag line, \u2018\u2018soothing relief.\u2019\u2019 (Current flavors: classic, honey lemon and strawberry.) Cadbury has produced the candy in Lagos since 1970. It\u2019s the official candy of the Super Eagles, the national Nigerian soccer\u00a0team. Edinburgh Rock, a confection that looks like a stick of chalk, was invented by a Scotsman known as Sweetie Sandy in the 19th century, when, as the myth goes, he found that old trays of candy developed a pleasingly crumbly texture. Recently, Ross\u2019s of Edinburgh, the only company to manufacture the candy in Scotland, was set to close, as no descendants wanted to take over the family business. But a local businessman named James Anderson stepped in, and Edinburgh Rock is still manufactured in Scotland. Flavors include peppermint, raspberry, orange, lemon and vanilla. Cadbury reigns over the chocolate market in Pakistan; in 2017, Mondelez, its parent company, accounted for 66 percent of sales, in part because of the ultrapopular Dairy Milk chocolate bar. But CandyLand, the biggest candy company in the country, owns half the market for other confections. It\u2019s also the largest producer of marshmallow in the country, including its Super Twister, a swirled rope of marshmallow with the color palette of a unicorn\u2019s tail. The candy\u2019s packaging was specifically designed to be attractive to children. An animated commercial for the candy has real-life kids swirling animated clouds and rainbows to create the pastel-colored sweet. The traditional version of gaz, a Persian nougat studded with nuts, gets its sweetness from the excretions of a bug called the tamarisk manna scale, which is found on tamarisk trees in central Iran. (Originally, people believed the excretions to be sap because they dried on tree branches. Not so.) The\u00a0candy comes from Isfahan and is made by combining the aforementioned excretions with starch, egg whites and sugar, heating it until it becomes the texture of paste and then stirring in pistachios. It\u2019s often formed into logs and served in rounds. Good news for the squeamish: Most versions you find now are made with other sweeteners.Don\u2019t let the name confuse you: It\u2019s\u00a0a reference to one of the biggest cocoa-bean producers in the world, not where it\u2019s made. The chocolate bar is known for its emotive commercials; in the 1980s, they used the slogan \u2018\u2018Even solitude feels sweet when with Ghana.\u2019\u2019 Recently Ghana commercials have featured the Korean actor and heartthrob Park Bo-gum.Lacta chocolate started in the 1960s as Galacta, named for gala, the Greek word for milk. In the \u201990s, the brand tried to move away from being known as a kids\u2019 candy and focused on a new slogan: \u2018\u2018The sweetest part of your life.\u2019\u2019 The company doubled down in 2010, crowdsourcing love stories from its fans and vowing to create a video out of the winning submission. It received 1,307 stories and made a 27-minute video, with more than 11,000 people voting online to choose the actors, character names and wardrobes; some even served as extras. \u2018\u2018Love in Action\u2019\u2019 was shown on Greece\u2019s biggest TV channel on Valentine\u2019s Day. Today Lacta is one of the best-selling milk chocolate brands in the country.This candy bar, which translates as \u2018\u2018bird\u2019s milk,\u2019\u2019 is made up of an airy, vanilla-foam filling covered in chocolate. The candy was inspired by the Polish confectioner Jan Wedel\u2019s trip to France, where he discovered marshmallow. Wedel started making the treat at the family factory in 1936. After the invasion of Poland, the company was forced to produce chocolate for the Germans, and Wedel was sent to the Nazi camp in Pruszkow. He survived the war, but the E. Wedel company was nationalized by the Communists and run by the\u00a0government until 1989. It\u2019s now owned by a Korean conglomerate, and there are flavors\u00a0and versions for every holiday. In autumn, they are cafe latte and peanut butter.The history of the Pineapple Chunk started in 1953 with Charles Richard Diver, a confectionery chef in Oamaru, New Zealand. He needed to figure out what to do with a bunch of leftover pineapple-flavored marshmallow from another product, so he covered it in chocolate and christened it the Pineapple Chunk. Over the years, Pineapple Chunks \u2014 or Pineapple Lumps, depending on the manufacturer \u2014 became a classic candy in New Zealand, and Cadbury manufactured its own version until ending production of it in the country earlier this year; now Rainbow Confectionery makes Pineapple Lumps. Don\u2019t confuse them for Australian candy, though \u2014 a TV station once included them in a gift box of Australian delicacies meant for the British band One Direction, and New Zealanders were not pleased. \nTrade Kings, a Zambian-owned company founded in 1995, manufactured Boom Detergent Paste and imported foreign candy. But when its trade partnership fell through, the company decided to produce its own candy in Zambia. Now, its Amazon Pops are a signature product, and the company manufactures tons of candy a year. The pops are also popular in Tanzania and South Africa, where Trade Kings claims that it opened the largest candy-manufacturing line in the Southern Hemisphere in 2010. The treats come in flavors like black cherry, strawberry and pink lemonade.The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Produits de Sucre Caprice, based in Algiers, has been manufacturing these small, soft caramels since 1965. Today the candy is also distributed in some countries in the Maghreb region (North Africa) and in parts of Europe. Though the company also manufactures fruit chews, flavored caramels \u2014 including toffee, coffee\u00a0and mint \u2014 and tutti-frutti-flavored bubble gum, the classic caramel in the gold wrapper is still an Algerian favorite.Tamarind, a pulpy, sweet-and-sour fruit, is a common flavor of candies in Latin America. Of them, Pelon Pelo Rico might be the wackiest: a\u00a0plastic container filled with tamarind gel that you can squeeze out the top so that it looks like a man growing hair, a sort of candy-style Chia pet. Pelon Pelo Rico hit the market in 1985 and sells several hundred million units a year in Mexico. The candy comes in several flavors, but fans of spicy candy would do well with \u2018\u2018hot intenso.\u2019\u2019Allsorts aren\u2019t a South African concept \u2014 the jumble of colors and shapes was invented by a British company called Bassett\u2019s, supposedly after a salesman dropped all his candy and a potential buyer loved the idea of the jumble \u2014 but Beacon\u2019s version is a best-selling licorice candy in South Africa. The company was originally started by a Lithuanian immigrant who began his business making chocolate in the 1930s. Beacon pitches Allsorts as \u2018\u2018the original play-food\u2019\u2019 because of the different shapes and colors that you can stretch and stack and mess around with. Though Allsorts are meant to be played with, they are popular among what the company calls \u2018\u2018big kids\u2019\u2019 \u2014 those from 18 to 54. Originally available only in licorice flavor, the packs of candies now come in four varieties.Taichiro Morinaga, the founder of the company behind Hi-Chew, grew up poor in Japan. In 1888, at 23, he moved to the United States, where he experienced candy for the first time and decided to become a candy maker. Eleven years later, he opened the Morinaga Western Confectionery Shop in Tokyo, and in 1918 it was the first Japanese candy company to produce chocolate. Years later, while searching for a gumlike candy that you can actually swallow so as to avoid the rude act of removing food from your mouth, he came up with the predecessor of the Hi-Chew, a Starburst-like candy with a softer texture. Since 1975, more than 170 Hi-Chew flavors have been on the market. The latest: A\u00e7a\u00ed, pineapple and caramel apple.The company behind this anise-based candy traces the confection\u2019s origins all the way back to the time of Caesar\u2019s victory over the Gauls, when he brought aniseeds back to his troops. Centuries later, monks in Flavigny began making candies with the seeds, attracting fans, including, reportedly, Louis IX. Today, the process is basically the same, with candy makers covering a single, two-milligram anise seed with layers of sugary syrup until it builds up into a hard candy that weighs a gram. They\u2019ve been manufactured by the Troubat family since 1923, and\u00a0you\u00a0can visit the factory, which is still\u00a0in a\u00a0monastery in France.This year, the Peruvian favorite, a\u00a0milk-chocolate-and-peanut candy bar, turns 90. First developed in 1928 by a company called D\u2019Onofrio, it was sold out of a wooden wheelbarrow known as\u00a0the\u00a0hokey pokey. Over the decades, it took over the chocolate market in Peru, and the brand, now owned by Nestl\u00e9, still sells 148 million candy bars a year. It also just got a bit of a\u00a0makeover, with new packaging and a new slogan on its wrapper: \u2018\u2018Wear a smile.\u2019\u2019 To show it off, Nestl\u00e9 Peru is running a\u00a0huge marketing campaign, on TV, in newspapers and on outdoor LED\u00a0screens around Lima. Shokolad Para, which translates as cow chocolate, was introduced in 1933 as Shamnunit but in the 1950s was renamed because of the picture of a cow on its wrapper. Originally only available with milk chocolate, it is now available with everything from nougat to puffed rice to popping candy. The \u2018\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019\u2019 actress Gal Gadot actually brought the popping-candy version on \u2018\u2018The Tonight Show\u2019\u2019 for the host, Jimmy Fallon, to try on air. Shokolad Para is still one of the best-selling candy bars in\u00a0Israel.Elise Craig is a freelance writer and the managing editor of Pop-Up Magazine. She has written for Wired, Marie Claire, The California Sunday Magazine and The New York Times for Kids.Candy is controversial. Scouring the globe in search of the sweet stuff reveals just how different our palates are \u2014 and how much we have in common.As with breakfast foods, I believe candy is often tastier the less expensive it is. I like my confections approachable. Low-rent. Basic. Shot through with a skosh of hoi polloi-ishness. Wrappers with cartoon mascots are promising. So is branding that testifies to soccer hooliganism as a respectable pastime. I\u2019d sooner crush a Quality Street (except the strawberry cr\u00e8me ones; barf) or a crumbly puck of Mexican De La Rosa than a morsel of marzipan molded by human hands to resemble a carrot on a dinky doily. If a wan man in a toque has ever loomed over the thing with tweezers, no matter how storied its provenance, I would enjoy its bootleg cousin more.Park me in front of any country\u2019s pick \u2019n\u2019 mix, penny-candy bins, Aji Ichiban, the part of the five-and-dime where jelly hamburgers live, and I will go to town. And I\u2019ve learned some tricks in my travels. In any Scandinavian country, you\u2019ve got to watch out for salted licorice; there are at least a dozen different kinds, and all of them taste to me like old spoons. But don\u2019t let that dissuade you from sampling the fruity stuff. Shake your selection in the bag as if you\u2019re crumb-coating chicken, so that you get an even citric-acid distribution.Russian bulk-candy bins are feasts for the eyes, with trillions of variations on the individually wrapped chocolate bonbon. The art direction on each tiny canvas is a marvel, featuring oil-painted landscapes, shiny-eyed squirrels, polar bears and swans \u2014 even the occasional camel. The thumb-size rectangular one, featuring a startled-looking infant in a babushka, is my favorite. (It\u2019s called Alenka.) British Smarties beat American Smarties, because candy-coated chocolate buttons are superior to chalky pressed pills; of the former, the orange taste delicious. Any flavor of Ritter Sport is crucial whenever you can find one (milk-chocolate cornflake in particular). The green Haribo gummy frog is peach not apple (common misconception); clear gummy bears are the best bears. But the best Haribo by my standards is the sour cola Balla Stixx (sometimes dubbed Zig Zourr) with a mallowy interior that I\u2019ve only reliably found in Italian gas stations. Still, Asia\u2019s flavorings are unrivaled. Hi-Chews lay waste to any other fruit taffy experience. Milkita melon is a singular delight \u2014 creamy honeydew drops \u2014 while Kasugai gummies in mango, muscat grape, lychee and yuzu (in that order) are a necessary part of any convenience-store run in Tokyo.When it comes to the United States, my opinions are more calcified. Red Vines over Twizzlers. Easy. The best M&M: peanut butter. Hands down. Milk chocolate over dark; white is not right, and the only correct way to eat a Kit Kat is to nibble off the enrobed edges and pry the wafer layers apart. Fight me. Candy is controversial. As with a beloved sports team, your affinities and fealties have been ingrained since your prelinguistic days. Such innate belief systems defy reasoning. Your mom loved herself a Goetze\u2019s Cow Tales or maybe a milky White Rabbit, so you do, too. How else could you explain how Circus Peanuts are still a going concern? Or those gnarly monstrous mint-leaf gel slices, the dial-up internet of candy?No one\u2019s madeleine will be exactly the same. But no matter your brand, it will always deliver similar things: the rose-tinted pleasure of nostalgia, a brief respite from adulthood and, well, whatever else it is that sugar does for morale. Despite all our differences, candy speaks to a fundamentally shared humanity; we like a lot of the same stuff. Most of us have some version of Fun Dip. Or Pop Rocks. Fruit leather. Caramel. A Tunnock\u2019s Tea Cake is a Mallomar is a Whippet is a Krembo \u2014 a cookie with marshmallow dipped in chocolate \u2014 except of course it\u2019s never that simple. One\u2019s kosher, one\u2019s Canadian, one appeared in \u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d and one\u2019s in a kilt.As a Korean kid who grew up in a former British colony, I might not ever be able to go home. But I\u2019ll kill a stack of Haw Flakes and chase them with Wine Gums, and the rush will remain the same.Mary H.K. Choi is a writer whose work for Wired, GQ, New York and The Atlantic focuses on culture. She is the best-selling author of \u201cEmergency Contact,\u201d a young-adult novel about texting, and host of the podcast \u201cHey, Cool Job!\u201dI learned how to take candy tasting as seriously as wine tasting. What I discovered surprised me.\u201cIt\u2019s glossy,\u201d someone called out from the back of the room.\u201cO.K.,\u201d Kimmerle said in a tone that made clear it wasn\u2019t exactly O.K. She turned to a graphic designer. \u201cYou\u2019ve got the Pantone matching system,\u201d she said. \u201cIs this a special kind of color?\u201dThe designer\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cCaramel color?\u201d she said, unsure.It was, in fact, caramel-colored, but Kimmerle, a 48-year-old native Chicagoan who has written four books on candy and helps companies develop new recipes, was after something more specific. Someone else suggested \u201cbronze,\u201d which seemed like a great adjective to me, but this didn\u2019t satisfy Kimmerle either. She pressed on: \u201cWe want to come up with a standard language for describing everything about this candy.\u201d It felt as if the group were in the midst of a middle-school pop quiz and no one was prepared.Kimmerle pulled her long hair away from her face to prevent the distraction of any scented products, lifted the bowl to her nose and demonstrated taking several \u201cbunny sniffs\u201d to avoid overwhelming the nasal cavity. \u201cYour turn,\u201d she told the group. \u201cWhat do you smell?\u201d Closing my eyes and sniffing, I picked up the distinct aromas of caramelized sugar and butterscotch, but kept quiet, curious to hear what the others were noticing.\u201cSweet?\u201d someone said timidly.\u201cSweet is a taste, not an aroma,\u201d Kimmerle replied briskly. \u201cFind other words for what you\u2019re smelling. And if you can\u2019t place an aroma, let your memory guide you there.\u201dOther suggestions included buttery, burnt, caramel \u2014 language that Kimmerle approved. Now she was ready to move on to flavor. She told everyone to write down any words that came to mind, whether they were one of the five basic tastes or any of the trillions of aromas the nose can detect. \u201cRemember,\u201d she added, \u201ctaste is what our taste buds sense. Everything else is a texture or an aroma, a volatile, airborne scent.\u201d The semantics of taste are a little finicky. The folks at Long Grove were tasting the candy, but now their task was to describe its flavor, which exists at the intersection of taste, aroma and even feeling (like the burning heat of a chile or the icy chill of menthol). Confusion radiated from their faces.The tasters began taking tiny bites and closing their eyes, chewing intently and rolling the caramel around on their tongues. \u201cTake your time with it. And if you feel like you\u2019re getting satiated, or what we call burnout, feel free to spit,\u201d Kimmerle offered gently, pointing at the plastic cups she\u2019d set out for everyone. \u201cIt\u2019s weird and a little creepy at first, but it can be helpful to reset. Just swish with water and try again.\u201d\u201cSo is it like that lactic sour that somebody once described to me as \u2018baby vomit\u2019?\u201d Kimmerle asked with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \u201cBecause that is actually incredibly appealing in certain foods.\u201dEveryone in the room laughed uncomfortably. Yet it did make a certain amount of sense. Sweetness often needs to be balanced with a little tang, and so \u201cbaby vomit\u201d wouldn\u2019t be an entirely unattractive quality in a caramel.Kimmerle was coaching the group through its first attempt at Sensory Evaluation (or \u201csensory,\u201d as it\u2019s called in the industry), a form of analysis used to measure the human response to any particular food or drink. \u201cSensory is all about using your five senses to make an assessment about a food product,\u201d Kimmerle explained to me. \u201cWhile it\u2019s considered a scientific discipline, it\u2019s really about using our human perception to describe and evaluate something.\u201dI\u2019d traveled to suburban Chicago to observe Kimmerle\u2019s workshop because I wanted to know if learning to taste candy like a professional \u2014 which is to say, as attentively and objectively as possible \u2014 could teach me how to better describe what I cook and eat. Putting language to flavor isn\u2019t easy, because we\u2019re rarely taught that it matters. As children, we learn the names of all sorts of shapes, colors and sounds. But when it comes to the way things smell or taste, the only language we ever hear is qualitative \u2014 good and bad, yummy and yucky, delicious and disgusting. And in adulthood, we learn that taking the time to describe the things we eat and drink is the pretentious domain of foodies and wine snobs going on and on about flavor profiles and horse-sweat bouquets.Once you start trying, you notice how difficult it is to assign language to taste and smell. The sense of taste is simultaneously public, because we come together to eat; and private, because we must put food inside our bodies in order to taste it. This paradox creates tension. Your experience of flavor is unique and unspoken; the mere act of describing it entails exposing something incredibly intimate. What if you share a bar of chocolate with a loved one and describe how it tastes, only to discover your companion disagrees? It\u2019s a remarkably vulnerable feeling, knowing that your most private sensual experience could differ so considerably from those to whom you\u2019re closest. Perhaps it\u2019s why we shy away from talking about flavor at all.Sensory evaluation is an evolution of the \u201cflavor profile,\u201d a standardized method developed by 20th-century food scientists to help manufacturers achieve consistency as they ramped up production in the postwar years. Myrna Fossum, a 77-year-old former home economist, is often credited as the mother of a simplified version that she marketed as \u201cthe Best Approach.\u201d After years in the test kitchen at Nabisco and Mars, Fossum realized there was a basic suite of easy-to-use tools that she could train others to use. A result was the relatively straightforward method of evaluation I\u2019d observed: less reliance on jargon, more on the senses.\u201cFlavor itself is a language,\u201d Fossum told me over the phone from her home in Plymouth, Mass. \u201cAnd like any language, it takes years to learn.\u201d Throughout her time at Mars (the manufacturer of M&Ms, Twix and Skittles), Fossum traveled to production plants around the world giving sensory trainings like the one I sat in on. \u201cWhether they were in Waco, Texas, or Hackettstown, New Jersey, they were speaking a common language,\u201d Fossum recalled. \u201cMr. Mars could pick up the phone and call any plant and ask, \u2018How is the chocolate?\u2019 and get an answer in plain English. He\u2019d tell me, \u2018You know, dear, this is my mantra: The most important thing is taste.\u2019 Even at age 84 he sat in every single training with a spoon, ready to taste. And if you think about it, it worked, because when you eat an M&M, it tastes the same wherever you go.\u201dIt makes sense that, within an industrial setting, the primary value of sensory evaluation is consistency. But why should nonprofessional tasters care about slowing down to describe the experience of eating candy? \u201cAt the end of the first day of training, I say to people: \u2018Go home tonight and taste your dinner. Come back and tell me about it tomorrow. Come tell me about your first cup of coffee,\u2019\u2009\u201d Fossum answered. \u201cThey come back and say, \u2018I never knew it tasted like that.\u2019 Until they do sensory, they don\u2019t pay attention to what things really taste like. They just drink and eat. So they learn, and they learn to appreciate.\u201dWhile companies use sensory evaluation to engineer better candies and meet bottom lines, anyone can learn from careful, thoughtful tasting; putting language to the experience can lead you closer to knowing what you like and don\u2019t like. It\u2019s why, as snobby as it can seem, wine tasting is an incredibly useful tool: The more wine you taste attentively, the more words you learn to associate with the kinds of wine you like, so the more easily you can choose bottles that will please you regardless of price. In this age of $12 chocolate bars and artisanal, well, everything, there\u2019s great value in knowing your own palate and letting that, rather than labels or prices or marketing, guide you in the store or through a menu or wine list. The point of candy is joy \u2014 pure, unadulterated joy. And that joy shouldn\u2019t be compromised just because you feel as if the \u201cright\u201d chocolate is the one that comes wrapped in hand-painted paper that looks as if it was trimmed by apprentices in Matisse\u2019s workshop.In fact, matters of taste are highly personal, and often colored by past experience. Both genetics and childhood exposure shape our earliest culinary preferences. And for adults, nostalgia \u2014 a literal longing for home \u2014 can also affect the flavors toward which we orient ourselves. This is why there\u2019s no one candy bar or bottle of wine that is universally beloved. And yet, because we\u2019re human, we can\u2019t help devoting ourselves to the pursuit. Sensory offers a reprieve from such futility; instead of encouraging the quest for a singular \u201cbest,\u201d it allows you to define, in plain terms, what sits before you, and determine how it makes you feel.First, we noted the appearance: a speckled slice the color of brown sugar. Next, we sniffed. \u201cNow, remember, we can\u2019t smell \u2018sweet,\u2019\u2009\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201cbut do you smell any fruit notes? Like brown fruit? Or baked notes?\u201d All I could sense was browned butter or ghee, some caramelized notes and cardamom.\u201cThink raisins, or dates, or plums,\u201d she hinted after another sniff.\u201cWell,\u201d she gently began, \u201cthe first thing that you sense when you put it in your mouth is that it\u2019s overwhelmingly sweet. Then, there\u2019s a dough. It could be wheat flour, or almonds. And I still really get the brown fruit. It could be date, date syrup. I\u2019m not sure.\u201dWe moved on to Limon 7, a packet of white powdered candy we found at the Mexican grocery that didn\u2019t look or smell like much. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not really a powder,\u201d Kimmerle corrected. \u201cIt\u2019s more granulated.\u201d As Cliff ran off, she and I closed our eyes and tasted it, looking up in unison with surprise. It tasted like pure citric acid and salt. \u201cCitric-y. Not citrusy, but citric-y,\u201d I ventured.\u201cIt\u2019s not sweet at all!\u201d she exclaimed. I looked at the ingredients, surprised to find sugar and a host of artificial colors listed. Neither of us could have identified the presence of either until I rolled another pinch of the powder around on my tongue, searching for a grain of sugar. \u201cI found a little sugar!\u201d I said excitedly. Even though I wouldn\u2019t have thought to call Limon 7 candy, I found it inexplicably enjoyable. Each taste was so unbelievably salty that it made me wince with something between discomfort and pain. Yet my mouth kept watering. I couldn\u2019t stop eating it. Or smiling.Eventually it was time for Pelon Pelo Rico. Pushing up on the base of the tube made the paste move through the holes at the top like noodles. The paste was glossy and brownish-red. We agreed that it smelled like some sort of fruit leather and tasted sweet, salty, with tamarind and chile and a little grit to the texture.\u201cOf all the things we\u2019ve tasted,\u201d Kimmerle said, \u201clet\u2019s say the tamarind has umami, which it might, this is the closest to a five-star confection. Meaning, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this hit on all the basic tastes.\u201d I tasted it again. She was right \u2014 every single taste bud in my mouth was firing simultaneously. The sensation was utterly delightful. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason those kids were sucking on this,\u201d she said with a grin.As we made our way through the massive pile of candy, I started to feel more confident about my ability to notice nuances. Every once in a while, I\u2019d even catch something before Kimmerle did. We started to move through each evaluation more quickly, easily arriving at consensus. At one point I even wondered, Is this what it feels like to be good at meditation?Days later, I found myself thinking of that aflatoon again. I looked up recipes for it. Nearly every one called for semolina flour and raisins.En route home with my haul, I bumped into a couple of friends. I excitedly doled out Pulparindo, certain they would love the salty, spicy, sour, sweet treat as much as I did. They were both suspicious. One carefully opened the wrapper, sniffed the bar and took a minuscule bite before recoiling. He might have even grimaced. The other took a bigger bite and then told me, diplomatically, \u201cI like it, but I wouldn\u2019t call it candy.\u201d There was apparently a vast gulf between our experiences of the same sweet.And yet I remember being a young cook in a fancy restaurant, where admitting that my sweet of choice was chock-full of corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors felt potentially disastrous. The chefs I worked for instructed me to slow down and think about everything I ate, even when it was just a deli sandwich or a slice of pizza or a scoop of ice cream. (A version of sensory, though no one would have called it that.) Dutiful young student that I was, I took the time to thoughtfully taste even my secret gummy candy, and for the first time I noticed that the sourness was only on the surface. I realized it was the same granulated white powder I used to can tomatoes: citric acid. Almost immediately, I thought of the candied orange peel I\u2019d learned to make and how the last step was to toss the cooked peels in sugar. What if, I wondered, I added citric acid to the sugar in my next batch? I could make my own natural sour gummy candy! And I did.Recently, I bought a bag of candy \u2014 Haribo sour gummy bears, of course \u2014 and brought them to my desk to conduct a quick, informal sensory evaluation. I pulled out one bear of each color: red, clear, yellow, orange and green. They didn\u2019t smell like much, so I skipped straight to taste. Clear, my childhood favorite, was pineapple, tangy and tropical. Yellow was lemon; orange orange. Red was some sort of generic artificial berry. But my first taste of green, my least favorite, which I\u2019d always called lime and often thrown away, caught me off guard. I fished a second green bear out of the bag. Then a third. I put them in my mouth and let the sour coating dissolve away. Then I chewed. As the unmistakable aroma of artificial strawberry flavor flooded my mouth, I couldn\u2019t help bursting into laughter. I\u2019ve been eating gummy bears since elementary school. But I\u2019d never really taken the time to taste them until now.Samin Nosrat is an Eat columnist for the magazine, a chef, a teacher and the author of the cookbook \u201cSalt, Fat, Acid, Heat,\u201d which has been developed into a new Netflix show.My journey to the dark heart of salmiakki \u2014 the uniquely savory, deeply strange licorice that Finland just can\u2019t quit.Reading about Strode\u2019s journey \u2014 which took him to Finland at the start of World War II, only months before the Soviet invasion \u2014 I thought about my own rapidly approaching trip to the same country, for the same magazine, 79 years later. I smiled at the pleasing symmetry. Granted, my surname does not double as an active verb, not even in Italian. Also, I was going to Finland to report an article on salty licorice. But otherwise, our tasks were not dissimilar. Strode had introduced his readers to a word that explained a distant country and its underlying values. I would try to do the same, only with a really weird flavor of candy.Here\u2019s another interesting statistic: Finland just scored the top spot on the 2018 World Happiness Report. It\u2019s produced by a United Nations initiative based on global polling data from Gallup, and you can make of the methodology what you will, but Finns reported themselves happier than any other nationality on earth, and they were followed on the list by three Nordic neighbors: Norway, Denmark and Iceland. Americans, meanwhile, came in at a dismal 18th. Correlation does not mean causation, but come on, this is totally causation, right? All those salty-licorice countries clustered at the very top? Maybe it\u2019s not so crazy to think about reported national happiness in relationship to something like a favorite national candy, because what is candy, after all, if not an elemental signifier of happiness and also something extraordinarily culturally specific and wrapped up in nostalgia and childhood memories and, by proxy, national identity?I was grateful for Annala\u2019s offer. Though it\u2019s no longer especially popular in America, I happen to enjoy black licorice, or at least I used to as a boy, when it came in the shoestring-length \u201cwhips\u201d more common back then. (These had the added bonus of really stinging if you managed to snap, say, a younger brother\u2019s arm or cheek just so. What can I say? \u201cIndiana Jones\u201d had just come out. We dug whips.) By Nordic standards, however, my licorice palate lacked sophistication. In the United States, our favorite licorice snack, far and away, remains the crimson middle finger that is the red Twizzler, which is technically not even licorice \u2014 those Twizzlers are strawberry-flavored, not licorice-flavored, contain no licorice extract and offer all the masticatory pleasures of an edible candle \u2014 and which I\u2019d imagine for licorice purists is akin to stuffing a loaf of Wonder Bread into a poster tube and calling what comes out the other end a baguette.Annala, diplomatically, made no mention of Twizzlers when we met for lunch at one of Helsinki\u2019s most venerable restaurants, the Ravintola Sea Horse, which has been around since the 1930s and is still a haunt of artists and cultural figures. The house specialty, fried Baltic herring, comes stacked like kindling on an oversize plate. Annala greeted me from a booth. In picturing him, a middle-aged professional obsessed enough with his favorite candy to start a fan club, I expected some combination of zany and plump, but he turned out to be a trim man with a neat, graying beard, pale blue eyes and a slight air of Nordic melancholy. He apologized for his low energy: He was just recovering from the flu. By day, Annala works as an editor at the Finnish News Agency S.T.T., the main wire service in Finland. \u201cSalmiakki,\u201d his handsome and lavishly researched coffee-table book, was published in 2001.Even before the addition of ammonium chloride, licorice root had been used as a respiratory and digestive aid for millenniums. It turns up in the \u201cCharaka-Samhita,\u201d an ancient Hindu medical text, and in Theophrastus\u2019 \u201cEnquiry Into Plants.\u201d And at least according to citations in the Oxford English Dictionary, \u201clycuresse\u201d is both \u201cgood for the voyce\u201d and \u201cdoth loose fleume.\u201d (The O.E.D. also quotes the English writer R.D. Blackmore\u2019s 1869 novel \u201cLorna Doone: A Romance of Exmoor:\u201d \u201cI cough sometimes in the winter-weather, and father gives me lickerish.\u201d) Sometime around 1760, an English apothecary named George Dunhill receives credit for being the first to add sugar to the licorice lozenges he sold at his shop, in the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, cementing the herbal medicine\u2019s off-label use as a sweet. So-called Pontefract Cakes are still sold in the United Kingdom, though now they\u2019re manufactured by the German candy giant Haribo.Had I expected things to proceed more in the fashion of a genteel tasting at a Lexington whiskey distillery and less like, say, a scene from a William S. Burroughs novel in which the characters ingest weird, made-up drugs? Yes, I had.Across the table, Annala seemed lost in a reverie. \u201cMmm,\u201d he murmured, closing his eyes for a moment, as if to shut out all senses but taste. \u201cSo delicious.\u201dAnnala tried one and determined that the belly was, in fact, marshmallow. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime to call this salty licorice!\u201d he said, throwing down the candy in disgust.Collin handed me a black lump and said: \u201cNow I want you to try this one. No one else does it. Tar candy!\u201d\u201cI remember tasting pure ammonium chloride,\u201d Hellsten said. He had pushed up the sleeves of his cardigan and was rooting around in the licorice pile.\u201cDid you like it?\u201d Annala asked.\u201c\u2009\u2018Like\u2019 is perhaps not the right word,\u201d Hellsten said.We were eating bowls of salmon soup in the cafeteria of a different Fazer facility near Helsinki, a building whose curved glass walls and blond wood ceiling made it look like a U.F.O. conceived by a team of Scandinavian designers. Tervonen had moved to Fazer eight years ago from another of Finland\u2019s iconic brands, Nokia. He told me Fazer was planning to introduce a line of premium dark chocolate called Nordi in the United States next year and gave me a sneak preview of the bars. The sleek packaging nodded toward chic, aspirational Scandinavian lifestyle trends, featuring scenes of Nordic splendor: pristine mountain rivers, the candied glow of smoke from a cozy sauna. \u201cHere, our brand awareness is 100 percent, but if you were to rank all confectioners worldwide, we\u2019re probably No.40-something,\u201d Tervonen said. \u201cSo we\u2019re competing with giants. What is typical for the category as a whole is it\u2019s an impulse decision. Not many people write down \u2018Buy chocolate\u2019 on their shopping list. So how do you get people to stop in front of what you\u2019re selling, make them curious and then get them to try it?\u201dI resealed the bag of hearts and replaced them in the shopping bag. I haven\u2019t touched any licorice since.The story of how Kit Kats, once a British chocolate export, became a booming business from Hokkaido to Tokyo \u2014 and changed expectations about what a candy bar could be.A Kit Kat is composed of three layers of wafer and two layers of flavored cream filling, enrobed in chocolate to look like a long, skinny ingot. It connects to identical skinny ingots, and you can snap these apart from one another intact, using very little pressure, making practically no crumbs. The Kit Kat is a sweet, cheap, delicately crunchy artifact of the 20th century\u2019s industrial chocolate conglomerate. In the United States, where it has been distributed by Hershey since 1970, it is drugstore candy. In Japan, you might find the Kit Kat at a drugstore, but here the Kit Kat has levels. The Kit Kat has range. It\u2019s found in department stores and luxurious Kit Kat-devoted boutiques that resemble high-end shoe stores, a single ingot to a silky peel-away sheath, stacked in slim boxes and tucked inside ultrasmooth-opening drawers, which a well-dressed, multilingual sales clerk slides open for you as you browse. The Kit Kat, in Japan, pushes at every limit of its form: It is multicolored and multiflavored and sometimes as hard to find as a golden ticket in your foil wrapper. Flavors change constantly, with many appearing as limited-edition runs. They can be esoteric and so carefully tailored for a Japanese audience as to seem untranslatable to a global mass market, but the bars have fans all over the world. Kit Kat fixers buy up boxes and carry them back to devotees in the United States and Europe. All this helps the Kit Kat maintain a singular, cultlike status.The Kit Kat first came to Japan in 1973, but the first 100 percent, truly on-brand Japanese Kit Kat arrived at the turn of the millennium, when the marketing department of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, the manufacturer of Kit Kats in the country, decided to experiment with new flavors, sweetness levels and types of packaging in an effort to increase sales. Strawberry! A pinkish, fruity Kit Kat would have been a gamble almost anywhere else in the world, but in Japan, strawberry-flavored sweets were established beyond the status of novelties. The strawberry Kit Kat was covered in milk chocolate tinted by the addition of a finely ground powder of dehydrated strawberry juice. It was first introduced in Hokkaido \u2014 coincidentally and serendipitously \u2014 at the start of strawberry season. Since then, the company has released almost 400 more flavors, some of them available only in particular regions of the country, which tends to encourage a sense of rareness and collectibility. Bars flavored like Okinawan sweet potatoes, the starchy, deep purple Japanese tubers, are available in Kyushu and Okinawa. The adzuki bean-sandwich bars are associated with the city of Nagoya, where the sweet, toasted snack originated in a tea shop at the turn of the 20th century and slowly made its way to cafe menus in the area. Shizuoka, where gnarly rhizomes with heart-shaped leaves have been cultivated for centuries on the Pacific Ocean, is known for its wasabi-flavored bars.A sales clerk was restocking the Kit Kat display in Don Quijote when I asked her which were the most popular flavors. She shook her head. \u201cThey\u2019re all popular,\u201d she said. She gestured at the empty tunnels of matcha-, grape- and strawberry-flavored Kit Kats that she was filling as a small group of Chinese tourists carried armloads of glossy snack bags and boxes back to their shopping carts, undoing her work. An Australian father and son rushed by in a panic, their cart heaped with gifts to take back home. \u201cWhich one, Dad? Which one?\u201d the child asked desperately, pointing to all the varieties. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d the father shouted, as if the timer on a bomb were running out. \u201cJust take one!\u201dIn Japan, Kit Kats were first licensed by the Japanese sweets company Fujiya, which capitalized on the chocolate\u2019s general association with Britain and the West. Early Japanese TV commercials for the candy drew on the chocolate bar\u2019s British roots to promote it as a foreign product, depicting British soldiers breaking for a treat. But in 1988, Nestl\u00e9 acquired Rowntree\u2019s and took over manufacturing and sales in Japan, eventually changing strategies. Since 2010, sales in Japan have increased by about 50 percent. Japanese Kit Kats are now produced in two Nestl\u00e9-owned factories in Himeji and Kasumigaura.There are three ways for a new Japanese Kit Kat flavor to make its way into the world. The classically trained pastry chef Yasumasa Takagi, a kind of Kit Kat maestro, was brought in by Nestl\u00e9 as a collaborator in 2003, after the success of the strawberry Kit Kat. He may decide he wants to make a special bar and propose the new flavor to Nestl\u00e9 \u2014 his first was passion fruit in 2005. The marketing team may also build a partnership with a brand, like Tokyo Banana, the locally famous cream-filled cakes on which the Kit Kat flavor is based, then ask a product-development team to experiment so they can bring a sample bar to the pitch meeting. Or the product-development teams themselves may feel inspired on a late night in the test kitchen after one too many cups of green tea and vending-machine sweets.Only the fanciest bars are devised by Takagi, made with higher-grade chocolates and other ingredients, like dehydrated seasonal fruits, and sold in Kit Kat Chocolatory stores, the boutique-like shops for luxury versions of the bar. In some cases, they are decorated like plated desserts at a fine-dining restaurant, the Kit Kat logo entirely hidden by tiny, delicate, colorful crunchies, or individually wrapped like a gift \u2014 a single Kit Kat finger in a crinkly plastic wrapper, tucked inside a box. After Kohzoh Takaoka, now chief executive of Nestl\u00e9 Japan, persuaded Takagi to work with the company, Takagi decided he wanted to make the bars more sophisticated, to play with the form and sweetness levels. He wanted, as he put it, to make Kit Kats for grown-ups, like the Chocolatory Sublime Bitter, a long, cigarillo-like bar of 66 percent dark chocolate, packaged in black and gold. (The marketing team uses the word \u201cpremiumization\u201d to describe this part of Kit Kat\u2019s strategy.) Now Takagi runs the brand\u2019s Japanese Chocolatory shops, including the one where I met him, in a particularly posh part of the Ginza neighborhood in Tokyo.\u201cJapan is No. 1 in terms of sales and profits, compared with Nestl\u00e9\u2019s other markets,\u201d said Ryoji Maki, Nestl\u00e9 Japan\u2019s marketing manager at the time, who was dressed in a beautifully tailored suit and eating a tiny pudding cup. Nestl\u00e9 did a market test after its strawberry flavor caught on in Hokkaido in 2000, to see how much production would be required for sales to go national. What it found was that the strawberry Kit Kat was especially popular among tourists, both Japanese tourists and those from abroad. Subsequent market tests suggested that Kit Kat had potential not just as a candy but as a kind of Japanese souvenir. The company looked to Kobe, Tokyo, Kyoto and other cities and wondered how to develop a chocolate for each that consumers might associate with the places themselves. Now Nestl\u00e9\u2019s most recent flavors focus on regional Japanese products \u2014 maple-leaf-shaped cookies, plum wine, roasted tea.It smelled strongly of cocoa and toasted almonds on the other side of the doors. Iwai assured me that this scent changed daily, often more than once a day, according to what was being made. He also warned me not to run, because I might slip in my new shoes. Iwai studied microbiology at university and has been working for Nestl\u00e9 since 2001; he has managed the Kasumigaura factory for the last three years. Wafers were the beginning of the line, the beginning of every single Kit Kat.I stood mesmerized for a few minutes under an archway of uncut wafers, like edible golden window panes, which were being cooled by ambient air before they reached an actual cooler. I heard almost nothing Iwai said over the sharp clanging and drone of the machinery. The factory is large and open, loud and clean, its production lines totally transparent. But the wafers had been baked out of sight, most likely between engraved, molded plates. Now they looked like thin, delicate altar breads, floating above us. They formed a continuously moving line, the sheets traveling up and curving toward pumps of cream in the distance.What makes a Kit Kat a Kit Kat? A Nestl\u00e9 executive told me it was the shape of the connected pieces: those long, skinny ingots with their recognizable, ridge-like feet of chocolate surrounding each base. A few people said it was the logo itself, in big blocky letters, embossed on the top of each bar. But when I spoke with Takagi, the pastry chef, he didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cThe wafer,\u201d he said. \u201cThe wafer!\u201dWafers are an art form within the food industry. And although plenty of companies make decent wafers, there is something about the Nestl\u00e9 wafer, Takagi said, that is quite extraordinary. Not that he knew exactly what it was. The wafer was the corporate secret, the heavily guarded soul of the Kit Kat. But like many lightweight, low-fat industrial wafers, the Kit Kat wafer is, very likely, mostly air and gelatinized wheat flour. It is crisp but not brittle. Crunchy but not dense. It is fragile but still satisfying to bite into. It is totally and alarmingly dry to the touch, like packing material. But after it has been touched with a little saliva, it doesn\u2019t even need to be chewed, and you can swallow it with no effort. Plain, the wafer is almost but not entirely tasteless. It has a very gentle sort of toastiness, barely there, but with an almost bready flavor. A sort of toast ghost. Not that it matters. A wafer\u2019s highest purpose is the nuance of its crunch.When a wafer doesn\u2019t meet standards \u2014 when it is cracked, broken, improperly embossed \u2014 it is tossed into a tall plastic bin next to the factory line. The company recycles these substandard wafers as local animal feed. \u201cThis is the countryside, so we have farms,\u201d Iwai said with a shrug. The good wafers \u2014 smooth, intact, deeply and evenly embossed \u2014 move along the line. They are covered with cream, then sandwiched with another wafer and more cream. The arms of a huge, gentle machine with extraordinary fine-tuned motor functions do all the work of building the Kit Kat, smoothing the cream and pressing the wafer on top of it, then pass the large, sheet-cake-size sandwiches along a slow conveyor belt through a massive cooler. After they\u2019re cut, four sheets at a time, the Kit Kats begin to look familiar, like ladyfingers.On the molding line, the chocolate depositor fills empty Kit Kat molds with tempered chocolate, and the fingers are dropped in and covered with more chocolate. A scraper removes excess chocolate and smooths the surface. When the chocolate is cooled, the bars are popped out and whipped through a wrapping machine. On my visit, the mostly automated factory was making several types of Kit Kat, including chestnut \u2014 a seasonal flavor for the fall \u2014 made with white chocolate and a mix of chestnut pur\u00e9es from Europe and Japan. The production line was a barely interrupted blur of white, like dotted lines rushing by on the highway, becoming indistinguishable from one another.I learned that Kit Kats were slightly, subtly different all over the world. In Britain, Nestl\u00e9 uses milk crumb, a sweetened, dehydrated milk product, to make the bars. In the United States, Hershey uses nonfat milk and milk fat, while in Japan, the factories work with whole-milk powder. In Japan, Nestl\u00e9 buys most of its cacao beans from West Africa. In the United States, a mix of beans from West Africa and Latin America is favored.Almost everything changes, but the wafers? The wafers never change. The wafers have a fixed standard that needs to be maintained, and deviations are not acceptable. Standing beneath the fresh, moving wafers, I asked Iwai if I could hold one, as if it were a newborn, and I did not expect him to let me. But he reached into the line and pulled one out, passing it toward me with two hands. The breeze created by his movements seemed to curve the wafer inward with pressure, but it didn\u2019t break. What I wanted to know was if this wafer, the one in my hands, would pass Nestl\u00e9\u2019s standards, but Iwai wouldn\u2019t share many details about that. All I knew was that the wafer was huge, golden, marked with square cups and totally weightless. That if it hadn\u2019t been still warm from the oven, I wouldn\u2019t have known it was there. That if this was the soul of a Kit Kat, then holding the soul of a Kit Kat was like holding nothing at all.Tomoko Ohashi was the lead developer on the Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat. Ohashi, a soft-spoken woman from Mito in Ibaraki Prefecture, ate shingen mochi when someone brought it for her as a souvenir from Yamanashi, the prefecture where it\u2019s still made today, and she knew how beloved it was. What she didn\u2019t know was how the mochi texture could translate into a chocolate bar. \u201cI was also very worried about replicating the flavor,\u201d she said, standing in the test kitchen of the factory in Kasumigaura, wearing the factory\u2019s all-white uniform with its white hoodie pulled tightly across her hairline.The kitchen didn\u2019t look like a lab. It was more like a real pastry kitchen, full of dehydrated fruit powders and matcha organized in tubs, chocolate molds and serrated knives and a marble counter for tempering chocolate. The challenge with shingen mochi, Ohashi said, was finding the balance between the soybean powder and the syrup. Because the sweet is so adaptable, everyone who eats it calibrates it obsessively, adjusting the ingredients so it tastes the way they like.Ohashi started work on the new flavor last September, and she finished it in May. In tests, she would make about 50 pieces of four to five different versions by hand, tempering chocolate on the marble table, and then taste them side by side, looking for the right balance of soybean powder to sugar syrup. The rice was the shingen mochi itself, but it couldn\u2019t play such a big part in the chocolate bar. \u201cThere\u2019s no device or machine for putting a rice cake in a Kit Kat,\u201d Ohashi said sadly. She knew, from the start, that it wouldn\u2019t be possible to replicate the texture of fresh mochi \u2014 tender, almost slippery in the mouth \u2014 in a chocolate bar. She did, to be true to the mochi, end up putting sticky rice in the Kit Kat\u2019s cream filling. Did the sticky rice in the Kit Kat help to mimic the mochi texture? \u201cNo,\u201d Ohashi said, bursting into laughter because she had made an uncomfortable kind of peace with what she could and could not do within the boundaries of her form. \u201cActually not at all.\u201dAfter all the testing, Ohashi concentrated all the flavorings in the cream filling: the sticky rice as well as soybean powder and brown-sugar syrup. The bars went on sale on Oct. 15, with packages of nine selling for 780 yen, or about $7. Standing in the test kitchen, I unwrapped the new flavored Kit Kat and broke into it with a crack. The bar was a mini, two tiny connected ingots. They were ivory, eggshell, the off-white color of a rich lady\u2019s kitchen, and the fine cream filling inside appeared a light brown.Just a few days earlier, I had made a pilgrimage to Kikyouya\u2019s factory in Yamanashi, where workers wrapped thousands of pieces of fresh shingen mochi by hand each day, to see exactly what Nestl\u00e9 was trying to capture. On my way, I stopped for lunch at a small noodle restaurant and sat by the window, eating a pile of salted plums. I could see busloads of tourists filing out in the parking lot, their floppy hats secured with strings, their shirts wet with sweat. They were fruit hunters. Yamanashi is green, dense with red pine and white oak forest and beautifully kept orchards that cut deep into its slopes. Fruit hunters pay to eat as much ripe, seasonal fruit as they like in a short span of time. Say, 30 minutes of thin-skinned peaches, or fat pink grapes, or strawberries, warmed from the sun, dipped into pools of sweetened condensed milk.Unlike apple-picking in the fall in the United States, the fruit doesn\u2019t really function as a souvenir, carried home in baskets to commemorate an idyllic, well-documented visit to the countryside. Fruit hunters travel to eat the fruit on site, right off the trees, in their allotted time. When the concept was explained to me, I thought the time limit seemed embarrassing. But seeing the fruit hunters of Yamanashi, I realized that it wasn\u2019t embarrassing at all. It was practical, it was beautiful and it acknowledged that souvenirs were, like memories, at best only approximations of the moments they represented. That it was, in fact, completely impossible to remove a taste from its origin without changing it in the process.\u201cHow is it?\u201d Ohashi wanted to know. The Kikyou shingen mochi Kit Kat was smooth to the touch, shiny. It had a brilliant, crumbless snap, which gave way to a pure white chocolate and caramel flavor and a lightly savory note. It was sweet, it was good. It was in balance. And it recalled fresh Kikyou shingen mochi, vaguely, like a memory gone soft around the edges.Tejal Rao is an Eat columnist for the magazine and the California restaurant critic for The Times.

At the start, 20 workers were responsible for the production of four million lollipops per month. Today, in that same factory, 200 workers produce more than 40 times as many.Today Colombina is a multinational company, but it is also a family one, run by the founder\u2019s grandson, C\u00e9sar Caicedo. The factory in La Paila has become perhaps the largest hard-candy plant in all of South America. Two thousand three hundred people work there, and it is not uncommon to find families where three generations have worked on the factory floor. Colombina provides day care for its workers, offers student scholarships and even holds a national soccer tournament where, this year, 34,000 young players had the chance to be scouted by the professional clubs. When the company bids the old year goodbye, it does so in a nearby coliseum, with the help of a salsa brass band, a generous spread of nourishments and refreshments and much dancing and revelry.It had been 10 years since I last had a Bon Bon Bum. When I turned 24, I deemed I was too old for them. Recently, the hankering returned, and I deemed I was old enough to have them again. I scanned the bodega shelves in San Francisco one more time before placing an order online. We all have our rituals for consuming candy, but I had forgotten what ceremonies I performed when consuming a Bon Bon Bum. Holding the stem in my hand, though, the rote motions emerged in spite of myself: I observed my hands unwind the cinched wrapper by twirling the lollipop head, I noted how I pulled the wrapper\u2019s flared ends down so that it looked briefly like a cape before slipping it off the stem altogether. Soon my mouth became full of familiars \u2014 the sweet and tart making my tongue surge, the accidental clack of the hard candy against the back of my teeth. I remembered that I used to try to make the orb perfectly round, sucking selectively, taking the Bon Bon Bum out to check my progress. I continued the old task, until the very first champagne-pink edges of the gum broke through the surface. Then, the sensation jolted childhood memories from me I did not know I still possessed.We whiled away the time by sucking Bon Bon Bums, my sister Francis and I. The ruby globe shrank and shrank until all that was left was the heart of gum. This was the metronome of our childhood. Once the Bon Bon Bum was gone, we ironed out the wrapper, and I held onto one end and Francis held onto the other. We would make a wish, then pull. Whoever got the longer wrapper got the wish. I wished for peace on earth, the survival of all whales, my first kiss. My first kiss came at night in the middle of the street. It was bookended by my taking a Bon Bon Bum out of my mouth and putting it back in. At slow hours, I held my Bon Bon Bum to the sun, watching the translucent red planet glow from within. There were air bubbles trapped inside, in the dazzling undersurface of the lollipop, which itself was striated like the radial veins of a banana leaf.Ingrid Rojas Contreras is a Colombian writer based in San Francisco.
